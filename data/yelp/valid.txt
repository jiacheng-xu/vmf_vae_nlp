4 took travis here for one of our first dates and just love cibo . it 's situated in a home from <unk> and has colored lights wrapped all around the trees . you can either sit inside or on the gorgeous patio . brick oven pizza and cheese plates offered
3 60 beers on tap ... what else do i need to say ? ok - ill say more . they are on the second floor at cityscape downtown and the bar has a enclosed patio area that overlooks the downtown area . the inside bar has live bands , open
3 when i 'm hungover we crawl to los taquitos and i usually get a big bowl of posole to <unk> my <unk> . it is so damn good . they give you the necessary extras like red onions chopped , cilantro , limes , and tapatio . you can either
1 i want to start off with saying that everytime i drove by stockyards and saw that giant <unk> on the top of the big , plain , white building , i always imagined it being a casual steakhouse with straw or peanut shells on the ground . it 's totally
3 this place has a really chill , almost a hipster feel to the place -lrb- normal for downtown phx -rrb- . all the servers are `` cool '' and no one is in a big hurry . we split this steak sandwich with fries and we also split a flight
2 what can i say ... ... it 's a good place to get beer . if you go into your dinning experience knowing that it is a chain restaurant , then you wo n't be disappointed . next time i 'll just stick to the beer .
3 great service and the food was spiced perfectly ... better than most any other restaurant than i have ever been to . the eggs <unk> me though . they cook their eggs on way too high of heat on the morning that i was there . i literally could n't
3 i love the feel of this place as soon as you walk in . i have always found the staff to be very friendly and the food and wine are great . i have been to italy at least 7 times and the pizza here is as authentic as it
3 yesterday my wife and i both had a `` half '' of the roasted sweet potato sandwich , which normally comes with `` roasted sweet potato , fresh mozzarella , fig confit , tomato , arugula , marinated fennel and balsamic vinaigrette on herb focaccia '' . obviously , we
3 the curious case of the <unk> review . i 'm sure i 've reviewed fajita 's before , but it seems to have <unk> . fajita 's has some spectacular lunch specials . i give them 5 full stars for their lunch , not so much for dinner -lrb- much
3 fresh baked breads , delish soups , salads & sandwiches . lots of vegetarian options . this place does it right ! entrees with fresh & uniquely mixed ingredients dot the menu . on my most recent visit , i opted for the sweet potato sandwich and a creamy artichoke
3 we stopped in at spinato 's the other day and had some thin crust pizza and a baked spaghetti calzone . all the food was delicious , especially the baked spaghetti calzone , which was something unique . the pizza was a bit too greasy for us , but some
3 as kelly m. mentioned `` they do n't use any lard in any of their food or animal products in the rice . '' - great for those of us who are vegan . last time i was there i ordered up a big plate of loaded nachos with beans
1 updating for the vegan perspective : i asked the staff & owner if their bread contained any animal products . he had no idea , but he did try to call his bread <unk> -lrb- <unk> 's bakery -rrb- to find out for me . unfortunately , they could n't
2 i would give 31/2 stars if i could , husband agreed . the service was phenomenal and the atmosphere was great . their chopped salad really is something special . but , i was quite disappointed in receiving 3 medium size scallops for dinner . and i did n't find
3 favorites : king crab pot , similar to risotto with fresh crab , <unk> portions compared to other dishes . black cod was amazing as were the side of mushrooms . butternut <unk> tempura great , just wait for it to cool to be enjoyed ! it 's great quality
3 went here for lunch with a co-worker . we both had the combo sandwiches -lrb- half pulled pork , half pulled chicken -rrb- i like the potato salad as the spices in it were good . my co-worker enjoyed the broccoli casserole . good portions at a fair price .
3 we had a great meal here ! i started with the cheap salad as i was craving salad . hit the spot . hubby started with smashed irishman drink and loved . he moved onto a draft beer . i moved onto fish and <unk> were light and just the
4 man what a great ball park . well designed and great food !!! this was my first spring training game ever and dont think i want to go to a normal game again ! you are just so close to the players and one of diamond back players threw me
4 best cheese steak ever . service with a smile and quality meat and buns !!
3 this location is near asu it 's a big restaurant and there 's outdoor seating . service was excellent . wings and beer were excellent . go and enjoy . happy hour prices are really good - it possible that this bww is a tad less expensive than the average
1 came here on the same night as trivia and sat outside . we never got any service , so we left .
3 we decided last minute to grab some breakfast here and it was a good decision . the place is small but fast . i had a great toddy and a hand and cheese sandwich -lrb- which is weird for breakfast but their ham was so good ! -rrb- . you
3 this was our first time here and we have been wanting to try it for a while . we went for lunch with boyfriend and his mom and it was the perfect time to go . dinner looked really good but pricey . i had a flat bread with a
4 was able to get a taste if their new brunch menu . wow . just as good as their lunch and dinner ! we started off with their red rooster italian style bloody mary . it was delicious and had <unk> cheese sprinkled in it - weird at first but
4 boyfriend had wanted to check this out for a while so we finally had the opportunity to go . the bartender was great and shook our hands which we appreciate . we sat at the bar and had the mozzarella sticks and the pretzel and both were delicious starts to
4 this was a great spot found by little sisters boyfriend . he saw it on groupon and did the research on yelp and we ended up going as a group of 6 . first off , their happy hour looks worth it in itself , but the dinner and drink
3 seriously good curry . serious . i 'm not joking . i 'm serious , the curry is very good . usually when a restaurant has pictures of the food on the menu i become <unk> -lrb- think of denny 's and village inn -rrb- , but here the photographs
4 the combination of art and hot dogs has been <unk> accomplished by this man and woman team in a mobile food cart . and they 're having fun doing it . and the food is made with love . and the soda selection is perfect . and the price is
4 biscuits made from scratch , not frozen . homemade pancakes with real buttermilk , not from a mix or box . homemade blueberry jam , no jar or can . true diner coffee . a group of friendly , engaging staff . five stars ... need i say more .
3 i used to be an in-n-out fan but five guys is now my new favorite new fast food burger joint . i think five guys gives you a good value for its price . the food is fresh and you can choose from a variety of toppings -lrb- from mushrooms
4 i like bookmans over barnes and noble because there is a large selection of lightly used <unk> games selling for half price . also they 're a great place to buy magazines for those airplane <unk> trips . bookmans usually has the issues for the current year , so if
2 this place is hit or miss . luckily , the last time i went was a hit with the yellow curry with chicken . i have been coming here for about 4 or 5 years . when <unk> is in the house , the food is generally better . -lrb-
2 the yellow curry was actually red and it was covered with red chili pepper . it was too damn hot for me and i could n't eat it . they were nice enough to offer to make me something else , which i took them up on it . i
4 if you believe bread makes a great sandwich , you will want to check out this place . i had the sausage and egg sandwich on 9 grain toasted . you could taste the fresh ingredients that all worked together beautifully . i will be back .
3 ok , so we ended up here as a fluke . went upstairs to watch a movie , only 2 seats were left and they were in the front row ... um ... for a 3d movie ... um ... no . -lrb- i 'm not saying ` no '
3 so we went here on monday to celebrate another milestone in my sweetheart 's life . the staff there is awesome and even changed the channel for us to catch a little monday night football as we did our <unk> -lrb- and oh so funny -rrb- version of `` oh
3 i enjoy cooking breakfast . but sometimes i do n't want to cook , i just want to eat something delicious ... and simple . there is n't much on the menu . good food does n't have to be complicated . my favorite breakfast here is their griddlecakes .
2 hmmm ... i just realized that i may have to cut back on starting my reviews with ` ok , so let me start by saying ... ' ... that being said ... ok , so let me start by saying that this review is slightly tainted ... * tee
3 and here we have stop # 4 on the urban wine tour . we <unk> our way down to the hotel san marcos and it immediately reminded me of the <unk> <unk> hotel in san francisco . this puts me in a zen , relaxed state of mind and i
3 i went here with several friends after a happy hour across the street in the biltmore . i ordered one of their daily specials , a grilled fish sandwich with a side of curried corn and white beans . the meal was tasty , but then one of the other
3 i love this place , it 's one of my favorite drive-thru burger places in town . the burgers are deliciously prepared and seasoned , the shakes are scrumptious and the fries are crispy on the outside and <unk> on the inside . just how i like 'em . there
4 just realized i never did a review for our wedding reception . so to begin , it was in the spring . i have to say everything was wonderful , the wine was flowing , the mixed drinks were mixing , the appetizers -lrb- flatbreads -rrb- , meals -lrb- salmon
3 thanks yelpers , for another great restaurant recommendation ! the bf and i went last night and really enjoyed our dinner . first of all , the service was excellent , everyone was so kind and attentive . i 've only been to indian restaurants a handful of times and
3 3.5 stars -lrb- somewhere between a-ok and yay ! -rrb- caramba is the authentic mexican version of a baja fresh or a rubio 's type of restaurant . it 's a clean restaurant in a strip mall with a fairly extensive menu and a friendly staff . while i would
3 finally made to to barrio cafe last night ... really enjoyed it ! our waiter was fun and <unk> and the place had a cozy atmosphere with great live music . the food was excellent - we had great margaritas and tableside guacamole . their braised pulled pork is delicious
3 our dinner club ended up at maizie 's this month after the other pick was closed ... we lucked out ! we were unknowingly there on $ 3 burger monday , so pretty much everyone ordered the burger . they had told us the wait would be short , 15-20
3 pastry ? pasty ? oh , it 's <unk> aka <unk> deliciousness . i 've noticed the hype on yelp and am really glad i finally hopped on the bandwagon . my friend suggested going to the mesa location because there is more seating than the one in tempe .
3 my girlfriends and i started a dinner club and zinburger was the first selection . i enjoyed it ! i had a difficult time deciding between burgers -lrb- the homemade veggie burger with tomato marmalade - which i 'm obsessed with right now - sounded so good -rrb- . i
3 the northeast valley is desperately lacking places to enjoy live music ... i 'm so glad for the compound grill . we had a great time there listening to music and having a few drinks . they had a pretty extensive selection of drinks and beers . the waitress was
3 i tried ling and louie 's this weekend on the recommendation of a friend . i 'm not a huge fan of asian food , so i might have been inclined to go with 3 stars , but my boyfriend really liked it , so i went with 4 .
4 i think this is the best wine bar in the east valley . they have a cool patio and inside a few comfy couches by a fireplace . they give you a free cheese or meat board with a bottle of wine so i rarely need to order any food
3 a great sushi bar owned and operated by <unk> and <unk> who are both japanese . their product is always consistent and they always have a few good specials . service is great and the staff is very friendly and cheerful . value is really good particularly within their happy
4 i love this place . everything we had was amazing , i thought the pork belly was truly the best presentation and cooked i 've ever had . the drinks are expensive but very good , i 'm loving jalapeo margaritas and they make a decent one . the scallop
4 we went in at that odd hour when happy hour ends and the lull before dinner service starts . that could of been reason to not get good service or food but zinc did n't miss a step . the food was great , i love their baked french onion
3 yay ! i 'm a fan of the ballpark , not the d-backs , go dodgers ! with that said , sorry everyone , i am a transplant and although az is now my home i can not stop cheering for my home teams . chase , bank one ,
1 if you are a smoker then this is the best bar in town . i am a <unk> so the outdoor second hand did not bother me , but if you are picky then sit inside . what did bother me was the service . our server seemed too cool
1 really , $ 5 for a smashed burger and little flavor ? ca n't say that i will be back , except for the fried pickles , maybe . i guess there are certain burger joints that i do n't understand , this is one of them . i heard
3 this place was awesome !!! my wife and i have been driving by this location for a couple years and finally decided to go in , i had a yearning for ramen . it did not disappoint . we got there just before happy hour , which is always a
4 we really like the food here . their things are not your typical food that you find at an average eatery . this is a mecca for vegetarians and also for meat lovers alike . i am surprised by the average reviews for this place because this location is always
2 well , i was disappointed . i was expecting this one to be a <unk> up container store . but ... it was just average . i used to visit container store in houston near the <unk> . it has a nice selection of things . people are always ready
3 did a take out order . that is how we normally eat jason 's deli . this was my first time at this particular location ... this particular jason 's deli did not look as clean as others that i have been to . it was very disorganized and small
4 great nursery . friendly staff . i was in the market for roses , but the gentleman who worked there said that now is probably not the time to be shopping for them . he told me they get their roses in december and by mid january they should have
3 i loved the salmon kebab with <unk> <unk> . yumm ... the <unk> or rice was the best i have ever eaten . and we eat rice almost daily . we also had the chicken and the lamb kebabs . i just had a little taste of them but they
4 we went to la stalla on a saturday night . it 's a warm , cozy restaurant that appears to attract an older crowd . reservations were not needed . first , the bread you get to start seems <unk> made . it 's really unremarkable and not worth eating
4 we went with another couple to the mission and celebrated our anniversary . it was dark inside but was n't stuffy or creepy . our waiter was relaxed and helpful . he suggested the avocado margarita . give it a shot -- you just may want a refill -lrb- i
1 we visited harlow 's around 9am on a monday morning . we were seated promptly at a booth near the bar . it was nice to see `` regulars '' interacting , but we probably wo n't become one of them . it seemed like everything was just cooked too
4 this lovely restaurant will make you smile . the service here is outstanding , the food is amazing and the beverage service perfect . people welcome you when you come in , the bar is very inviting and eddie , the bartender is quite the character . he really makes
4 this place has the most amazing rock shrimp tacos - and on sunday and monday you can get half off bottles of wine . one of the best outdoor patios ever because it sits on scottsdale road and you can people watch all afternoon sipping wine !
0 awful service . this place is owned and run by some crazy corporate people that have never been in the service industry . this is a classy place that was too cheap to finish the flooring and kept the concrete . they have decent happy hour but the drinks were
4 i dined at this amazing place on sunday the last day of restaurant week - az . . they put together an amazing menu that was really worth the cost . started with miso soup - perfect ! second had the ahi poke - which was prepared on these little
4 this is the macho man randy <unk> ! welcome to christopher 's restaurant \ <unk> lounge ! oh yeah ! -lrb- to the late macho man randy <unk> ! -rrb- christopher 's restaurant is actually far from the <unk> . i would say it has a lot more class and
4 coffee , music , and <unk> ... i dig this joint ! it 's like walking into a brew house with some random people hanging out . live music and freshly made coffee . i have to say one of the best coffees i had in a long time .
1 i 've eaten before , but tonight was just a social mixer . let 's start off with the obvious ; food ... like the 2 stars headed `` meh . i 've experienced better '' i feel like they try to wow you with the portions and the extra
0 sorry gang ... still ca n't recommend this place . my reputation is on the line and i got ta be honest , if i ever tell you go to this place ; please forgive me . i enjoy the atmosphere , but service is still lacking . i 've
3 south mountain why you so far !? south mountain is probably the largest hiking and biking grounds around the city . i think the longest hike is about 14 miles long across end to end , but then again you have to hike your butt back ! needless to say

2 depending on what you 're looking for ; if it 's food mmm okay it 's alright . service was not excellent but not bad either . i think sting ray 's in general is more for it 's atmosphere . go for happy hour and drinks , aside from

4 downtown chandler is definitely a hidden hot spot ! latitude eight is one reason why you should come by . i love thai food and lat 8 fills my stomach with love ! they bring out that thai flare and <unk> american plating . ambience is trendy and sleek ,
3 nice and quaint ... just like my buddy said . i really appreciate restaurants putting their time into cooking . they make their own pasta - yum ! i got the special ; wild boar with marinara and pasta ; definitely different and definitely wild : -rrb- bottle wine ?

4 the carne pizza is amazing and so are the 5 dollar martinis .
3 great lunch spot . i love the diner look , and the good food comes out fast . 7 dollars for a combo is a bit pricey , but it 's better quality than any of the fast food restaurants .
4 stopped in for a beer and it was delightful . service was fast at the bar and it was reasonably priced .
3 one of the better sushi restaurants . the sushi could be fresher . i like the entrance and the excessive outdoor seating . the wait is n't normally too bad and the happy hour rocks .
4 ahhh , how i thought i would be disappointed reading reviews before going to biancos , but i was anything but disappointed . the reviews suggested that some select people did not think it was special . those people are wrong . i had a perfect lunch the wise guy
4 i have n't had the food yet , but they make a mean cappuccino .
4 durant 's ohhhhh how i love thee , from your meat <unk> to your prime rib . i can always count on your cooked to perfection food , stellar service , and stiff drinks . if only more were as great as you . i would have to say that

3 i really enjoyed this small coffee shop . the espresso had a nice smooth flavor . the space is very cool , and the environment is very laid back . i went on open mic night . had a lot of fun .
2 another one bites the dust . too bad , this was one of the only excuses to stop by city north . i think when they took the couches out , people stopped coming . i came here with a group of girlfriends to <unk> our plans for a trip

3 yes , the kitchen during restaurant week was a mess . i am pretty mellow about waiting for food , but my friends were getting pretty upset . we waited almost 2 hours for our meal . with that said , i give them a 4 star because the food
2 the place is nice , the ambiance , not so sure , very scottsdale i guess . the appetizers that were ordered for the table , did n't look so great , so i skipped it , not worth the calories if it is not delicious . my hubby 's

4 we came to the <unk> house decorating event with the twins . what a great time . it was nicely organized . they set the tables in the back and the smaller children had the houses ready to decorate , while the older ones could build them from scratch .
1 i 'm not one to usually complain and you can see that on my review history but this place offers terrible terrible service , slow service -lrb- they were n't busy -rrb- and overpriced food and drinks . was n't impressed w / the food and for sure will never
4 my weekly place to hangout , if i do n't answer my phone i 'm probably here .
4 i always leave here happy and full ! the cocktails are very tasty and at a good price point . if you come at lunch the crowd is usually business men but nighttime is a different story . there are always trendy good looking people to look at while enjoying
3 this location is very nice and always has great take out service . i usually go with the hummus plate and one of the soups . the bread that they give with their salads are definitely worth the drive ! the cupcakes are sub -- par so do n't waste
3 this yogurt place is way better than any of the others around the area . they have unique toppings such as strawberry and mango boba and delish baklava . they also have the awesome oatmeal cookie flavor , last night they featured a new flavor `` bit o honey ''
4 this place is great . food was awesome , with plenty of spices and herbs in everything ! <unk> was n't sure she was going to have anything -lrb- she 's not that fond of greek food , despite her name . i think her <unk> <unk> from some lame

1 this place has been around a long time , and i 've been there quite a few times . it 's hard to find decent cajun food in phoenix , but kay 's usually does pretty well . our last visit was n't the greatest . the duck & andouille
4 my favorite place to buy wine ever ! the selection is wonderful , the prices are incredible , and the staff is confident and friendly . i 've gone on a saturday for a wine tasting and was able to learn more than i had expected in just a short

2 this place reminds me of a `` subway '' but for pizza . it is decent food , but a little over processed in my opinion . when i went , i was under the impression that i could get a glass of wine , but they did n't have
2 good place to grab a slice of your favorite pizza for a couple bucks . ca n't go wrong with options like that !

1 my senior prom was held here some years ago and - much like the <unk> of events that led up to my high school graduation - the arizona center still makes me feel socially awkward , unwanted , and uncomfortable . i do n't even know the names of kitschy

3 cozy , small place , but just the thing if you want to hob nob with the trendy people of downtown phx . frequented by <unk> , <unk> , and the nouveau <unk> . wonderful drinks and for the designated drivers , some decent snacks to keep your belly occupied
1 if you like bland food , this is definitely the place to go !!! ok , those of you who like bland food will never admit it and that 's ok , but if you are looking for ethnic or even interesting food -lrb- or greek/mediterranean like it says in
3 before reading this review , you should know i 'm from the deep south ... i grew up on this kind of food , know how to cook it , and come from a long , long line of people who cook it . ok , having said that ...
2 very good veggie burger that you can sub into their different types of burgers ... i got the thousand island one . yum ! great happy hour prices , plus the bartender was knowledgeable and generous w/the alcohol . the waitress was super attentive even tho ' it was packed
4 parking can be a pain but so worth it . so fun ! i 've been to char 's on random nights of the week and no matter what it is still busy and the live music is awesome . rarely can you count on a place to have quality
2 its a pretty nondescript dive . its basically a hallway , which makes its kind of neat ... and there is a big fish tank with weirdly cool fish to stare at . otherwise its your typical dive bar atmosphere . they do have ` fish tank specials ' which
1 it just did n't knock my socks off . maybe i was expecting too much from some of the previous reviews but it was fairly mediocre in my book . the restaurant itself was trendy but was nothing out the ordinary ... no memorable qualities or specific ambience . typical
3 i actually like this original vig better than its uptown counterpart . the outdoor area is definitely my favorite part and its much bigger than the vig uptown . although its a popular spot i have always had luck finding a seat outside and under a heater lamp ! there
4 as a recent grad who just quit her job , i find that i have a lot of time on my hands ... i am needing to fill my days while <unk> the confines of my house ... so i 've been on the hunt for local coffee houses to
3 okay , first off , i 'm one of those people that come here strictly for food and not beer . do n't judge me . i 've frequent this certain location <unk> ever since westgate opened . the location is ideal -- far away from the bars , stores
2 while frequently going to yogurtland , i 've always eyed this place , wanting to try it out . my time finally came ! i had stopped by at panchero 's after getting some yogurtland the other day -lsb- yes yes , dessert before dinner <unk> -rsb- . i had
3 it could be the chocolate mint martini followed by the candy cane martini which was then followed by the pomegranate sunset but i had a great time tonight -lsb- as i always do -rsb- ! i went with the crew originally to another brewery at westgate but the asu game
3 i had the pleasure of dining at celebrity roy <unk> 's <unk> : roy 's ! i had enjoyed a roy 's trio -lsb- hibachi salmon , blackened ahi , and <unk> butterfish with steamed rice and baby bok <unk> -rsb- with a <unk> on the side . the hibachi
3 while on a recent adventure with a childhood friend , we decided we wanted korean bbq . we normally frequent other establishments but a while back , someone had told me about this place . so by chance , we stumbled upon <unk> . during our an hour and a
3 like most phoenix restaurants , you ca n't judge by the outside . you walk in and it is transformed into a warm inviting living room . i loved the seafood options and really loved the margaritas - too much so .
4 i ate at some really nice places in phoenix/scottsdale , but i am still fantasizing about oregano 's . the pizza is perfect and the deep dish cookie is indulgent ... ask for your cookie well done if you do n't like it <unk> . arizona - you are lucky
4 finally , another indian restaurant in phoenix worth praising -lrb- udupi is my other spot -rrb- -- we stopped in after work this evening for a quick bite , expecting the usual bagged frozen veggies in <unk> curry . what we had was a hearty , flavorful , fresh ,
4 what a great place - i stopped in for lunch on a monday and was pleasantly surprised by the food , service and ambiance . the outdoor patio is a tranquil space on a nice day . the selection of `` big salads '' on the menu is great for
1 first time there and sat at the bar . at first we were over <unk> by the customer service -lrb- two waitress helping us out -rrb- then after awhile there was absolutely no one we could get to order a second drink . we waited about 20 mins just to
0 last saturday evening , me and a friend went here and sat at the bar . it took 10 minutes for the bartender to notice us and there was only three people at the bar . he finally came over to ask us what we wanted then he when back
0 been there a couple of evening and sat out on the patio area where the waitresses ignore you until you jump up and grab one even though she run ever table around yours . she wont even look at you when you wave at them . had to go to
3 i visited the herb box for lunch several weeks ago and thoroughly enjoyed the coconut shrimp salad . a friend mentioned that if i liked the lunch i would surely love their breakfast . do n't have to tell me twice ! i suggested the herb box for brunch with
4 delhi palace is my favorite indian food restaurant ... ever ! do not be deterred by the exterior . just trust me on this one . what awaits you inside will make you forget everything you have ever known and loved ... you will want to sit there and eat
4 buttered baguette , brie cheese and pickles . these three ingredients happen to rank among my favorite things . never would i have thought to put them together . add turkey and you have yourself one heck of a delicious sandwich . my first visit to the cider mill and
4 delhi palace has won my heart for indian food . there is a great lunch buffet that is well worth a drop in from time to time . i 'm not sure if this location is associated with the delhi palace on university , but i have been to both
3 i really like this place for breakfast . there is almost never a wait for a table , even on saturday morning . the food and service is reliable . there are some healthy options on the menu as well as some very not healthy options -lrb- which we all
3 i have enjoyed the bar at <unk> bianco a few times . i am not by any means a bar goer . but , i enjoy a glass of wine and a cheese plate . the setting is comfy and intimate . it is a nice place to visit .
0 my friend reminded me of the best part ... when we walked outside after our horrible meal , there was a nasty used green <unk> on the floor . yuck .
3 i have to agree with rand h. , this carolina 's is far superior to the one at 12th st. & <unk> . it 's well kept inside and most times that i have visited this location it is pretty clean . i have been there times when there are
2 i talked my gracious date in to taking me somewhere new for dinner on friday night . he wanted dicks , but i can be pretty convincing when food is involved . i head read a lot about centurion on yelp , so i persuaded him this was the spot
3 i love keegan 's ribs ! a full rack is a steal at 20 bucks . i usually order by phone and pick them up and take home <unk> with steamed broccoli and cheesy potatoes . last night i tried the crme brule and it was creamy and <unk> deliciousness
3 i went back and tried the vegan scramble and it was delicious . the girls there are really sweet and attentive . and again and excellent latte !
2 fast , fresh and incredibly cheap . i have had the turkey cranberry sandwich and the turkey bacon panini and both were well under 5 bucks and pretty good . this place reminds me a lot of wildflower . the only disappointment was the mushroom bisque soup , it had
2 i 'm sorry to this but i must admit i was pretty disappointed with the food options at this yelp event . the staff was awesome and i still dig this place , but the meatball choice seemed poor planning . being my first yelp event i tried not to
3 why oh why did it take me so long to discover padre 's ? being a huge fan of modern mexican cuisine , i was pleasantly surprised with the quality of food served at padre 's . i found them to be in the same family as dick 's or
3 i 'm a big fan of this place . usually come here with tori b. as she is the only reason i venture out to chandler . they have an excellent happy hour for drinks $ 2.50 margs , $ 4 tres olives and $ 1 off beer and wine
2 came here for lunch and was pretty disappointed . the wings were tiny , seriously the smallest wings i have ever had , like mini wings . the meat plate sounded good , we ordered chicken breast in bourbon sauce and pulled pork . the chicken was good , tender
2 i was skimming yelp looking for something new to do on a saturday night when i ran across compound grill . it is quite a distance from my house but it looked interesting enough to make the trek . we got there just before 9pm and were promptly seated .
2 i remember when cafe boa was affordable . the <unk> boa was $ 12.95 , half that for their panini 's . . imagine my shock to learn my favorite dish is now $ <unk> . . for mushroom filled pasta . . really ? they do have a great
4 i have been to mabel 's a few times now and i think it is a pretty stellar place . the food is awesome -lrb- try the chicken <unk> and the deviled eggs -rrb- and the drinks are strong . the ambiance is nice and cozy and i think it
0 i took advantage of the groupon and took a party of 7 for lunch today . the menu online stated `` choose any 2 items , combination of soup , salad , pasta for $ 9.95 '' of course when we got there that was no longer on the menu
3 awesome coffee , i got an iced coffee and it was pretty delicious . it was strong but very low in <unk> , which is always the way i prefer an iced coffee . i also ordered the veggie frittata and took it to go . i was really impressed
3 do n't let her looks fool you las <unk> is awesome ! sure she is located in a run-down strip mall but the food is delicious ! piping hot chips are served with salsa and a yummy bean dip . big , cheap margaritas and great specials on combo plates
0 i 'm really not a fan of this place an quite frankly i never have been . the entire ordering system is completely screwed up . you walk up and order and then you are supposed to stand there and wait for them to cook your burger , while people
2 when we arrived we were told there was a 45 minute wait . i looked around at all the empty tables ... hmm . . so where are all these people and where are they waiting ? she points me next door to a really cool and swanky lounge .
3 i had almost forgot about the rhythm room , and then in the space of two weeks i have been twice . i saw tim <unk> -lrb- best known for his work with dave matthew 's live at <unk> college -rrb- and the witty and <unk> <unk> band from the
3 after reading so many banging reviews i decided to hop in to dd 's and give it a try . i was immediately impressed with the selection . tons of fresh salads , sandwiches and mains . i was feeling to lazy to cook so i picked up the garlic
2 went here with tori on sunday and we had a really good time . the restauraunt surrounds a duck pond and we are both big duck fans so we sat outside and the ambiance was great . this is the perfect spot for wedding or work parties . the patios
1 went back again last week , the menu has improved but the service seemed to have gotten worse . our waitress disappeared for over 20 minutes , after bringing us the wrong check . i was finally able to flag her down and tell her about the check only to
2 five guys opened on mill today in the old coffee plantation location . the place was bright , loud and busy . i was immediately impressed with how many people they had working ; i counted 14 just behind the counter . they had classic rock playing so loud you
2 i chose blt for my birthday dinner a few weeks ago . we were given a table with an excellent view and our server started off great . he recommended a few different cocktails and told us about the daily specials . the popovers were amazing and i loved that
2 the chicken shwarma , <unk> and <unk> deluxe are excellent . the garlic sauce is so good i want to drink it . can you smell my breath from here ? awesome staff and a cool store in the back . try the cookies and the baklava , they 're
4 if <unk> chophouse had a theme song it would be `` so fresh , so clean '' by <unk> . this place was amazing , truly immaculate . flawless table dcor and settings , highly organized number system , beautiful <unk> ice sculpture , a true treat for the eyes
3 so i was a little bored one evening and decided to finally try this place months after the hype of grand opening . i figured by now the hour long lines will be long gone and everybody in maricopa county had tried it at least once by now . so
3 place is geared for <unk> but can be really fun if you had 5 or more mixed drinks . shooting zombies , racing cars , shooting <unk> , shooting monsters , all that fun arcade stuff . and you also get tickets to win overstuffed animals or just put it
3 ok so i finally made it to the oakville grocer in scottsdale . while i have only heard legendary <unk> of the napa legacy ... i enjoyed the concept of deli meets grocer with all of the wonderful merchandise . what i am not too sure about : - wine
3 village tavern has been a regular staple and a place where i go for comfort food ... they have meatloaf on the menu - how can you fo wrong with that ?! they have everything on the menu from all the soups and salads , to burgers , pizza ,
3 nestled into the heart of old town , at the former <unk> location ... i just had to come here knowing that chef jose garces yes ... celebrity iron chef was the genius behind the menu ... drool ! all menu selections were served in sharing portions which makes this
3 a great place for lunch with a very modern and chic <unk> is always pleasing - a great place for a business lunch too ! i always have the bento boxes which have a little bit of everything in a good combo . the tempura is exceptional too . nice
3 it 's been a while since being to maggiano 's - my last visits were around opening a few years ago . how can you go wrong here ... especially with italian !! i forgot that all of the portions are huge here - so some sharing was in order
3 visited <unk> . i have seen this restaurant show up on yelp prior but never had the chance to go . looking for breakfast place and we were in the area . this is a nice `` cafe style '' restaurant . located just off the runway and parking area
0 visited <unk> ... so was craving bbq . what would be better than that on memorial day weekend . went with two other friends . had heard this place had recently opened and my friend had heard by rumor mill it was good . first , i do n't give
3 visited <unk> ... this is a gem that is tucked away at the southwest corner of alma school and 60 . in the same parking lot as chicago pizza . went for a brunch . figured it would have cleared out but noon . nope . still line to get
1 cherry blossom noodle caf used to be a wonderful restaurant . i do n't know what 's going on there now , but they appear to be having problems <unk> good staff . unfortunately this means the food quality has become very inconsistent . spicy curry beef linguine used to
2 delicious food , good service , nice atmosphere . drinks are too expensive except during happy hour . last time i went we were seated next to the kitchen - worst seats in the house - though there was no one else in the joint ; menu does n't display
4 awesome , we had the meat and cheese board it was very good and i particularly liked the pizza . the sauce had a really good flavor . my husband who is a pizza snob said it could have used more toppings , maybe more pepperoni i guess . service
3 certainly an interesting experience . i was sad that they did n't have the yelp promotional check-in gift . the chairs ? amazing . you get a blanket and a pillow . if it is n't a good movie you will have a stellar nap . the food was great
4 awesome food nice environment . the fish and chips here are to die for .
2 oddly enough i am not a fan . the pizza is good do n't get me wrong but i find humble pie 's selection and taste better , cibo 's is also better in my opinion . the wait is too long , the tables are too small and the
4 absolutely amazing . my husband and i went , we had farm burgers , garlic fries , onion rings , a milk shake order the milk shake , and a fried banana split sandwich . the food was amazing , the vegetables were crisp and perfect . i would drive
4 did the other reviews mention the free wifi ???
3 great mother of gumbo ! flavors of louisiana is good homestyle cajun cookin ' right here in the desert ! the food has just enough warmth to make your taste buds glow . the shrimp are huge and juicy ... so the po-boy is pure heaven . i wonder if
3 the prime is one of my favorite places in phoenix to go for chinese food . the place has been open for ages . when i first started going there for dinner , they had white floors and red <unk> booths . the place had the atmosphere of a 50s
3 ikea is an event in furniture and home decor shopping . i 've tried to `` pop in for a couple of things '' but it never works . i end up lookin ' around for way too long ... first , i wander around on the top floor looking
3 matts feels like home . the tables remind me of snack time in grandma 's kitchen , the salt and pepper shakers remind me of the ones that sat on my neighbor 's counter in her collections ... even the slightly wobbly leg of the chair reminds me of my
3 los dos <unk> has been the dining destination of choice for <unk> headed to south mountain . we would ride our bikes there in the morning on sunday ... they would let us put our bikes safely inside in the back , and we would proceed to chow down on
2 d & b is a great place for the family to go have some fun in doors playing video games , bowling , and shooting pool . my 10 year old son really enjoys this place compared to the other places that have indoor games . we like to compete
3 ok , i have to admit i 'm a secret <unk> of matt 's delicious ever so crunchy , thick and well seasoned bacon !! bacon , bacon , bacon is what keeps me coming back to matt 's big breakfast and of course their pancakes , pork chops ,
3 the other day i was discussing options for lunch with a colleague near the glendale mall and with loads of places to choose from we <unk> our search down to somewhere that serves fresh ingredients with a mediterranean or greek flair ~ pita jungle seemed to be our best option
4 this wildflower bread company store is fantastic ~ a great place to go for breakfast , lunch or even dinner ! i love a good cup of soup with a side salad or a half sandwich for lunch . if there is a wildflower close by , that 's usually
3 we went to el chorro lodge for brunch the other day and what a wonderful experience we had . there are a lot of reviews already written about this arizona landmark restaurant so here 's another review to consider if you 're thinking about trying el chorro lodge . restaurant
3 decided to drive a bit out of the my way to try rocket burger & subs based on the `` yelper '' reviews !! this place is too clean for a `` greasy or a dive '' title , but there food reminds me of some of the best <unk>
2 i had an enjoyable lunch here with rand h. and mike c. the other day . indian paradise has a very nice lunch buffet with a variety of authentic indian cuisine items to choose from . restaurant ~ very clean and inviting . it 's not a large restaurant but
3 there are so many reviews on lux and i could just reiterate what 's been said already ~ but they really do have incredible coffee and pastries !! whether your a <unk> , fan or even if your dislike lux , they have some of the best coffee is phoenix
3 the folks at humble pie know how to make very good pizza ! they have two locations , but i can only vouch for this particular one . location ~ conveniently located across the street from the desert ridge mall tucked away into the little strip center . the restaurant
4 yay ! i 'm still a fan and i think this torta is `` as good as it get 's !! if your craving a really tasty torta , mexican sammich , you can not beat los reyes de la torta , aka the mexican sammich king !! the shrimp
1 i had so high expectations of this place that i left pretty sad . nothing to remember . lame fries , lame burger and uber messy . and this location in particular has no parking -lrb- besides meters -rrb- and no bathroom . fail .
2 i 've seen donovan 's name all the time in the airplane magazines listed among the top 10 steak houses in the country so i went there like 3 years ago . i was n't impressed and that 's why i never went back . but i believe that everybody
3 i ca n't believe this place averages 3 stars . what 's wrong with people ? this is my favorite bbq spot for many reasons . i know , you might be asking yourself , why then no 5 stars ? well , there 's always a waiting list that
3 what a quaint little place ! the drive through single standing building makes this neighborhood joint look kind of out of place . put it has a great patio -lrb- dog friendly -rrb- and the decor is pretty appealing . the bar looks great , i 'll have to try
2 i went on a wednesday and sat at the bar . food was ok , wine was priced right , service ok . pretty solid place to hang out if you do n't have high food expectations . great terrace .
1 so i 've been waiting to try this place for a long time and i was disappointed . the only good thing was the sauce . all the meats were super dry and flavorless . the service was good -lrb- it was a monday -rrb- . the prices would be
3 this is a neighborhood gem , for sure . i 've driven by several times and last saturday i finally made it . the place took me to happier times when i used to go to neighborhood restaurants with cousins and the kind as a kid . a non pretentious
3 always a classic . pretty consistent , great prices . good food . the service could improve , though .
3 i 'm a big fan of this place . sadly , i have n't tried that many dishes because every time i go in , i have to get the gyro and the greek salad . i hope one day to be able to broaden my palate and report on
4 i finally checked out this store after months of meaning to go in there , and i 'm so glad i did . i love their stuff . this beats the heck out of the supermarket spices . and they are reasonably priced too - about the same as what
3 we went to roy 's for a midweek dinner & it was so crowded we ended up sitting at the bar . no problem , they serve the full menu . until the end of september they have a combo plate available that features both the butterfish & beef short
4 such a beautiful resort ! my parents stayed here over the weekend so we popped over a few times to visit them & check it out . the staff were friendly & very helpful when we had any questions . the rooms are beautiful & pretty spacious . the bathroom
3 we went to sol for the first time this week for lunch . the interior ambiance is beautiful & the patio is fabulous . since it was n't scorching out , we opted for the patio . for starters , we ordered chips & guac . very good , but
2 very mediocre airport when it comes to food & frills . security lines can be dreadful when only 1 line is open , but at least everyone working has been pleasant . i will say that i appreciate that it 's always been clean when i 've traveled through !
2 we went to dragonfly cafe last weekend for breakfast at around <unk> . we were nervous walking in as we were the only people in the entire restaurant , but slowly more hungry patrons arrived . i ordered eggs benedict & ryan ordered the biscuits and gravy . the eggs
1 so disappointed ! we went to crackerjax last night to play mini golf & <unk> and it was such a waste of money . we paid $ 6.50 / each for 18 holes on the most horrendous mini golf course i 've ever played . the greens have permanent <unk>
3 i made fun of a new acquaintance for his love of whole foods and of course find myself there the next week . to add to my <unk> , i love it . it is well worth the drive and the only grocer in az where i have been able
3 i love running <unk> ! my dad almost died walking it , but he made it and enjoyed it . -lrb- definately happy i did n't push camelback -rrb- less crowds at wierd hours . can get cold at the top and if you want to be absolutely ridiculous and
2 we had our wedding cake with honeymoon sweets as part of a wedding package . everything went well at the tasting -lrb- beside a minor complaint of the tasting cake being still semi frozen -lrb- we were the first tasting of the day -rrb- . the tasting cake was amazing
2 nice <unk> dense thin waffles . standard fried chicken . did n't live up to the hype .
4 this was the most delicious thai food i have ever had . this is also the best food i have experienced in az including some high end restaurants . it `` tasted like vacation '' as <unk> stated by my dining partner . we split the dumplings , papaya salad
3 how can you not enjoy an arriba happy hour ? <unk> weekdays if i am not mistaken including $ 1 margaritas and half price appetizers . that 's right ! $ 1 margaritas ! they are delicious and completely make up for the pretty sad apps . love it !
3 great lakes , beautiful short trail , and in close proximity to the zoo and <unk> gardens . came here for engagement photos and we had a blast . it was nice our dog was allowed .
4 we 've been to a few new places lately , some were even pretty good , but none inspired me to write . until today . we had lunch at a brand new place in old town scottsdale called big earl 's . it 's a bbq joint run by
0 i went to hobe because i wanted a flank steak that was larger than the usual pound and a half <unk> found in the grocery store , and although i know how to do it myself , i wanted to save myself the work and have it <unk> by the
4 wonderfully al dente pasta with authentic italian sauces . a very european feel all around , including the unisex bathroom .
4 really ?!? how have i not reviewed you , vovomeena ? this is my go-to brunch place . i just love it . the decor is perfection . the food is delightful . the biscuits are divine . do yourself a favor and go here asap .
4 this place is such a win ! i am so happy that this tiny , easy to miss <unk> joint turned out to have such fantastic <unk> ! you know it was good because after we devoured -lrb- literally -rrb- our burgers and fries , we stood back in line
4 fantastic , gourmet pizza in an <unk> atmosphere inside what used to be a federal bank . love the idea of <unk> a space rather than knocking it down . the wait was very long on a friday night , so i would recommend going at another time . but
3 absolutely love pita jungle , especially this one because of where it 's located in a historic building . a few weeks ago , my husband and i took his family here , who are of <unk> descent . of course , they were delighted to see hummus , falafel
3 my husband and i went here on a weekend in phoenix that was actually pleasant and mild ! the weather definitely helped improve my opinion of the place , as it is an outdoor restaurant . we had a slight wait on the sunday morning that we went , which
3 i really enjoy the vibe inside giant coffee . wide open , bright and airy space , with an attached boutique that is good for browsing <unk> ordering coffee . i really enjoy the iced <unk> latte . great for someone who is not a fan of <unk> coffee drinks
4 an extremely busy airport restaurant , but for good reason ! it has the lgo quality that we all crave , with fresh , local ingredients . it is truly a taste of home away from home , which makes traveling seem less sterile and dull . at breakfast ,
3 i 'm knocking off one star for the less-than-stellar food -lrb- <unk> flatbread , soggy fries -rrb- . otherwise , i love this place ! great beers on tap - i got the angry orchard hard cider . i love the decor and ambience . the back patio is so
1 i had been to the gordon biersch in tempe several times before going to this one in gilbert . i 'm not sure i was ever in love with their food -lrb- or their microbrew -rrb- , but the atmosphere in tempe was always very upbeat and lively , which
3 met up with a couple friends for a double date at this ahwatukee pizza place . they frequent this joint fairly often , so i knew it had to be good . we ordered the caprese salad , and a made-to-order pizza . both were delicious and worth eating again
4 `` welcome to firehouse !! '' that 's the greeting you get from the entire staff when you walk in the door -lrb- and if you go with my boyfriend , he <unk> that greeting along with the staff every time anyone walks into the place as well -rrb- .
2 drove all the way downtown from gilbert to try this place out -lrb- we were just in maui for the first time and loved the hawaiian spin on food -rrb- . upon arriving , we caught the tail end of another customer 's order and the employee at the register
1 i love small business ... so i 'm always disappointed when i ca n't give a rave review . we went to hillside spot after a race -lrb- running -rrb- so we were starved . i went to the counter and ordered an oj and pancakes . they took our
3 came here once before but tonight was my first time on the patio . the patio is a great atmosphere with fun music playing , comfort seating and misters everywhere -lrb- except for our seat ! -rrb- . i asked the hostess if it was too hot to sit out
3 this is a great place to come to for a saturday or sunday brunch but be prepared to wait . i came around noon on a sunday with not many people waiting in front of me , the hostess said 15 minutes and we did not end up getting seated
4 tried yogurtology for the first time and boy do i love it . the way that the frozen yogurt comes out of the machine just makes it look so light and smooth ! this place is extremely clean and staff is friendly . a variety of flavors makes always creates
3 love all of the trader joe 's . this one , the parking lot is a little tough and an odd size for the location . otherwise , always great produce for a great price . always walk in and walk out with a ton of groceries without spending a
2 eh . is all i have to say . i have come to this location multiple times now for lunches , happy hour and dinners . i normally have a good experience eating just some good sushi in the <unk> area . this time i felt like our server took
2 was there last night for the first `` ladies night '' . they were a mess ! first off , i have to say that the place is beautifully decorated and the menu looks good . the service was less then desirable . 6 <unk> could n't tell me specials
3 north scottsdale does n't have a large selection of breakfast places ... so i have to travel down to `` the city '' . i am glad that i did . over easy is aaron may 's 2nd restaurant here in the valley ... some of you may know his
4 one of my favourite spots to eat , and it 's even better on a monday or tuesday night when you get a board of bruschetta and a bottle of wine for $ 20 . that may seem like a lot at first , but considering their bottles of wine
2 we 've been here a few times , when we 're jonesin ' for sushi but do n't want to pay an arm and a leg . is it the best sushi in town ? nope . is it decent ? i 'd say so . you ca n't beat
3 i hate to admit it , but this was my first time at mojo . not only that , but i think it was the first time i 'd had frozen yogurt in something like 25 years . it sure has changed since then ! i was very pleasantly surprised
3 trader joe 's has a great selection of fairly priced foods . this location opened somewhat recently and has become a favorite of mine because of its more spacious floor plan -lrb- relative to most other tj 's -rrb- . the only gripe i have is that the parking spaces
3 still going strong after all these years and rightly so , thai <unk> rocks it every time . great food , fast courteous service , and mom-and-pop ambiance . you really ca n't go wrong with any of the food here , but i especially love all of their curry
2 if you 're looking for breakfast , i guess this place is better than going to denny 's . huge with the arcadia and hipster crowd . emphasis should be placed on ` crowd ' . it 's very cramped here in the mornings and sometimes finding a place to
3 the blue hound at the hip and stylish palomar hotel made me <unk> with happiness . will you have to drop some significant green at the blue ? sure . but the service on the night i visited was pristine and attentive . presentation fantastic . interesting mixture of colors
2 to me , this bar is a great concept with terrible execution . the one time i went the musicians were subpar and they could not get the crowd into it to save their lives . if you have ever had the chance to go to pete 's dueling piano
2 what a treat ! this western themed restaurant is as hokey as it gets . we went to rustler 's rooste for a rehearsal dinner and the set-up outside was pretty cool with city views . between the rattlesnake appetizers , fried shrimp , bbq chicken and the many libations
3 yummy nachos , good local brew , and a cool , laid-back atmosphere . one of the few places in tempe i really enjoy . while i still feel old at times , it is not nearly as overrun by college students as the bars near campus ... like maloney
4 i want to have every meal of the day here ! this was my first experience with flemings and it wo n't be my last ! the padres and i came here for an early dinner on a sunday . when we arrived , we had the restaurant to our
3 this was my first time at this location , which happens to be the original macayo 's , and i could n't help , but be reminded of the robert frost poem , the road not taken ... two roads <unk> in a yellow wood and sorry i could not
3 this is my second venture to iron chef . both times i have only ordered sushi and edamame with their green tea iced tea and both times have been completely satisfied . being that arizona is landlocked , finding decent sushi is a challenge . my first experience at iron
3 one of the better movies theaters located inside a mall that i have frequented . stadium seating , clean , and <unk> -lrb- is that even a word ? -rrb- seats . the snack bar is typical of harkins theaters and they do have those extra popcorn <unk> at each
3 had lunch here today with my mom around 12:30 pm . the place was busy , but not packed . i like the fact that two of the walls of this restaurant are windows so there is plenty of light and people watching to be had here at scottsdale quarter
4 i 've been to a few different zipp 's location and this is my favorite location to sit outside on the patio . if you like sports and bar food , then my friend , you have found your place . lots of tv 's , lots of beer -lrb-
4 dear fry 's employee that works behind the pastry counter , i 'm sorry i <unk> on the window by the caramel apples . it is one of my few -lrb- okay , many -rrb- weaknesses . sincerely , <unk> p.s. you 're smart for having a window as a
2 ultra cool peeps , great service . nice and <unk> decor and atmosphere . nice ma and pa asian restaurant !
4 great entertainment ! great bartenders ! great ambiance !
3 omg . the short ribs are fantastic . every time i come here , i always have the short ribs or the tacos . when you walk in the front door , be sure to grab yourself a freshly baked cookie .
2 had the crab wontons and a chuck <unk> roll . crab wonton were ok . skimpy on the fillings . nothing special . chuck <unk> would be disapointed with his name on the roll . it was n't kick a $ $ . the food was ok . nothing exciting
4 get the sweet and spicy burger and a beer . life does n't get much better than this ! service is great , food is even better .
2 while being downtown this place was a must needed stop , not being a wine drinker or beer as well , i ventured out into the unknown . the place was literally packed from wall to wall , walking in there was nearly a game within itself . fortunately ,
0 unless this is the only store open i refuse to go here . id rather pay more money at frys sprouts ajs . you best have a lot , a lot of time on your hands to go here . between the running screaming children and the lines backing up
3 i had doubts ... i mean c'mon , how good can it be ? after a brunch with friends on a sunday , i am a fan . we started with the chips and guac . pretty good ! i could not decide on what to have - i saw
3 took the mrs here after coming for a happy hour with friends . dinner on a tuesday night and it was pretty happening . what i enjoy is the decor and the great hh prices . $ 3 imports / $ 3 house margs ! we started with an order
3 had some foody friends from denver in town so we wanted to experience with them . seated near the back patio door which was cold and smokey when they opened the door . do n't sit there ! like others have said , the interior was kinda like a mini
2 my pizza was excellent - the margherita with the addition of mushrooms had lovely sauce and an excellent crust - and only a little high in price for a medium pie -lrb- to be expected for the bianco name -rrb- . my husband ordered the spaghetti with pomodoro sauce ,
2 this place is 3 stars in the best sense . it 's really super cute and 50s <unk> . the inside is really nice but a little cramped , with a beautiful patio , <unk> decor , and even tiki mugs . there are lots of fun , <unk> ,
3 i 've been here many times , in groups of two or three , and i 've always had great experiences . the menu is really extensive , and everything we 've tried has been tasty . my go-to order is their delicious seared ahi sandwich - great fish ,
3 we came here on a fairly quiet night and had a nice <unk> . great sushi , cute atmosphere , and good service . we rarely come here because there 's a really excellent sushi place closer to home , but these folks served up great stuff . we tried
4 this place has wonderful , interesting food and a cute , small indie shop vibe with an outdoor patio - love it !! their protein burger , house style , is probably my favorite veggie burger in the valley . they call it hearty and healthy , and it is
3 this venue is great example of a simple , slightly divey <unk> concert venue . i 've seen a few different shows here , and it seems to be well designed so even people closer to the back can see . the sound quality is good , and they feature
3 three weeks ago , i started a review that i have n't gotten to the bottom of yet : -rrb- we were at the yelp event , failing to <unk> anything free from the pizza vultures , and decided to just go ahead and order anyway . i.e. , this
2 cider it 's not just for dinner ! strongbow on tap , did n't have other types in bottles . i have a reasonably good choice of irish bars near my house so my experiences here are during the lunch hour . there seems to be an almost <unk> aversion
2 this place was n't even going to get a rating . it was busy on a fri night around 7pm but the outside area had many a single table occupied with loads to <unk> a 45 min wait . stood around a minute outside while thinking of another place to
2 bar : ok let 's call it a bar like object which is closer to the truth . no cider . order a 12 <unk> single malt . . dont ' know the names available but <unk> she found one , then could n't get the price on it ,
0 our server had an aloof attitude and made us feel like he was doing us a favor for serving us . my margarita was terribly sour and i had to send it back -lrb- something i rarely do -rrb- . after eating the mediocre pretzel appetizer , we asked for
3 the food was far better than i expected considering the <unk> atmosphere there on a saturday night .
3 my favorite place for sushi in old town . the <unk> happy hour -lrb- 3pm -rrb- i can think of .
2 i think that canteen is fantastic in the way of food and drinks . everyone who 's had one of their margaritas knows that they 're fucking incredible . how could they not be with approximately 6 billion different kinds of tequila behind the bar ? i 've been here
3 narcisse is a funny place because it advertises that being <unk> is a good thing . the decor has these decorative , novelty mirrors on the walls because <unk> , blah blah blah . thing is , i do n't think they 're being ironic or making any sort of
3 granted , i was smashed and had a giggle fit so bad i almost <unk> to death on my own tears , but i had a blast ! this guy who became my best friend , but whose name i never bothered to get , showed me around and i
4 cafe lalibela is fantastic . i love eating there because the food comes super quick and it tastes delicious . it 's healthy , tasty and fills you up for a long , long time . i am , in no way , an authority on what makes for good
3 the clarendon is a hotel with a real level of charm to it . i 've been to a lot of hotels and most of them , most of the <unk> hotels that cater to a lot of business travelers are so dull and lifeless that it 's almost extraordinary
1 man , i feel kind of disgusting . i just ate at philadelphia sandwich co. and there 's so much grease and fat inside of me that it does n't know where to go . i think it 's going to swim through my <unk> and form tiny little hands
4 top 's is amazing . i love going there . their beer selection is fantastic and the customer service is awesome . you do n't feel like you 're at a store . you feel like your friend just so happens to own a liquor store . you will get
4 the duce is fuckin ' rad . they make the best screwdriver . <unk> are typically boring , but i urge you to get one here . so bomb . so goddamn bomb . i 've been here a few times and i 've always had a great time .
4 ahhh pizza ... . i love pizza . am i a pizza snob ... yes and no . if i have my choice , i would leave all the chains behind ... pizza hut , little <unk> , dominos , they are all blah . not alot of taste and
3 ok , i 've read some of the reviews here and i honestly ca n't disagree more . sure , it 's a big , outdoor strip mall . yes , there are nothing but chains here but honestly , practically everyone i know shops at target , barnes and
4 i have been here several times now so it 's time i write a review . i love this place !!! seriously !! ok , i know soda is bad for me weather is full on cane sugar or diet stuff , it 's all bad . we all have
4 i used to frequent the whole foods in campbell , ca . it was a nice , clean little store with nice produce , friendly staff , a homey feel . it was one of the places i was going to miss when i moved to az . . ah
3 my sister and <unk> were in town and we were going to meet them for lunch . it 's the weekend before christmas and they are headed to jamaica the next day , lucky bums !! my daughter and i pulled into the parking lot and it was a zoo
3 i have driven by flancer 's so many times and said `` i need to try that place '' to myself every time i do . well the time finally came ! my friend robyn n. had a groupon and invited me to <unk> . for some reason i was
3 this review is for their happy hour . my friends and i were winding down saturday evening and thought trader vic 's would be a great place to have a drink . we sat outside in the lovely patio surrounded by bamboo and a crazy looking tiki in the corner
4 i was n't going to write a review for old town farmer 's market but the more i thought about it , the more i thought it was awesome !! i did n't get a chance to look around much but what i saw looking like the most amazing of
4 i 'm bumping up a star . this location has a really nice atmosphere and the customer service has been very good ! i think the kids menu is one of the best around . my daughter loves all the choices . it 's a great idea ! the red
3 really great views of the valley , especially stunning at sunset . drive isnt too bad , last around 15-20 mins . weekends can tend to get a little crowded , would recommend going on a weekday if possible .
3 a really charming feature of the phoenix metro area is the farm at south mountain . located a couple miles north of south mountain , it truly brings out that midwestern nostalgia that has a very simple comforting feel to it . our destination at the farm was morning glory
3 al 's make a very tasty beef and sausage combo . dipped with hot peppers is the only way to go . as a chicago native i can honestly say this sandwich tasted just like the one from the chi . they 've got ta change the sign on the
2 i like trader joes alot , but i hate going in there . it 's always so busy and crowded . maybe i 'll go right after they open , or right before they close . anyone else notice how chaotic it feels in there ?
4 we ordered the combo chi style pizza . omg ! yummy , yummy , yummy . i ate until i was full and then ate some more . i 'm a definite fan . the sauce is a little sweet , but it works . i 'm looking forward to
3 i really enjoyed the chicken and waffles . i got it to go , so the waffles were soggy , but still very good . the hot sauce was a little to heavy on the vinegar for my tastes . overall i was very pleased . the red velvet cake
2 if you are looking for a healthy alternative to anywhere in the <unk> area you may leave this place feeling like you 've lost weight .
4 best pizza in town . must try the mamma spinato pizza , its the best !
1 allow me to start out by saying i never thought i would be the type of person to write an email regarding a dining experience -lrb- good or bad -rrb- . having said that , the only positive thing i can say about our evening at your restaurant was that
4 we have a joke that when i die and go to heaven st. peter will meet me at the <unk> gates with a <unk> 's chicken salad sandwich . my friend even knows how to get free babysitting out of me . yup - just give me the sub already
2 meh , maybe if i was a big breakfast lover . for me <unk> is <unk> -- lol . this place is an experience though . total dive . the place is like from the 50 's with the colors and <unk> of the decor . but hey that 's
3 finally was able to go after hearing so much about it . yes , they do have original <unk> potato salad . <unk> . i have been searching for that since i moved here 30 plus years ago . the chicken salad sandwich i had was very good , ny
3 i guess pastrami is the way to go here and i do not like that so can not offer a fair review on that . however , friends say it is pretty good . the sandwiches are fine but not a 5 star deli . they have a nice selection
3 a valley staple . i am not the biggest bbq or smoked meat fan but the food is good and the portions are huge . if you like bbq and soul food check it out . their sweet potato pie -lrb- and surprisingly potato salad -rrb- is extremely delish !
2 happy hour here is our new awesome place . you just ca n't beat it . 5 dollar plates and they are full size , huge servings . asian nachos , lettuce wraps , and shrimp , thai spring rolls . tonight we also had the pineapple upside down cake
2 quaint house ! restored to a restaurant so very small and yes prior reviews say it is noisy and it is ! but that was ok with us . the food is not great but probably ok for az standards . i am a picky ex <unk> so i did
3 i have been eating here for several years and have sent tons of people to eat <unk> far none have ever had a bad experience . -lrb- it is a super modern restaurant -rrb- now i wish i could say all the food is great , i am sure it
3 been here two other times now . the food and service here is very good . i even gave a spanish lesson to a server . lol -- the chef is from mexico city so no tex mex here . great happy hour place with my <unk> . rasberry habenero
3 <unk> , this place is sooooooo delightful ! the staff here , especially the blonde dude working the counter , are totally awesome , helpful gems . i forgot about this place and have been wanting to check it out since the remodel . being in the neighborhood i stopped
3 one of the things that <unk> me when i want a night out is that the movie i want to see is never playing at the right time to eat dinner out too . you either have to eat dinner way too early to finish in time and make the
4 i love pj . the cilantro jalapeno hummus is to die for . the lentil salad is wonderful . actually anything i have ever eaten here is delish .
2 i love me some dive bars , and in that regard patties does n't disappoint . it 's definitely not trying to be anything other than what it is . but despite the authenticity of it 's dive status , it 's definitely not my favorite place and i 'm
4 ok , i 'm going to admit living in the ` dale i have no reference for good mexican food as i 'm not sure it exists there . however the experience and food at tia rosa has been so <unk> fantastic i have to give this place a <unk>

4 short leash dogs are the best hot dogs in town . if you are in downtown phoenix on a friday afternoon , you should head over to short leash and try one of their awesome hot dogs . my favorite hot dog is the bear ; it has peanut butter
4 i have been on a lot of light rails before and this one is favorite one . you can go from phoenix to mesa , in a couple of hours . it is pretty new and the city does a great job at keeping it clean . i like taking
4 this event was by far my favorite event . i love sweet and i felt like i was in heaven with all the deserts . there were cookies , english muffins , cakes , croissants champagne , muffins and gelato . lgo and lindsay did an amazing job with this
4 copper blues is a cool place to some and listen to some music or hear some comedy . my husband and i have been to copper blues a couple of times now . the staff is really great and the food is great too . also they have a huge
2 so , we decided to try out the new steak salad wraps . while we did not realize that the steak was going to be cold and the steak had a lot of fat on it and it was not cut up too . hopefully next time when we go
1 coffee : decent , but did n't blow my skirt up set-up : nice decor , lots of room to spread out service : awful . do n't make me feel like i 'm <unk> you . i can and will take my business where it 's appreciated -lrb- fair
3 had my first matador the other day and thought it pretty much rocked unlike its sister shop on central , this lola keeps it simple with good coffee served by friendly staffers who spin vinyl at a reasonable volume . reliable wi-fi , too . this location is ideal for
4 this historic deli is one of a handful of places downtown where i 've never had a bad experience . the pastrami and corned beef are the best in town and the french fries and chicken noodle soup are brilliant <unk> . downtown deli is definitely a place to go
2 my long overdue debut at bliss/rebar came after a wonderful night at the theater . the evening mild and the company superb , it would have taken a major <unk> in service for bliss to get anything less than 3 stars . fortunately , the service was first rate .
4 this is my regular coffee joint so be prepared for a totally biased review . i was drowning in a sea of starbucks before cartel came and saved my life . now , instead of drinking daniel <unk> office <unk> i can skip three blocks and belly up at cartel
1 i want to like this place , i really do , but today 's new york steamer was probably a top 10 disappointing sandwich of my life . soggy , lifeless , unimaginative , and overpriced . i 'd been to firehouse one previous time , and the meatball was

3 this little coffee house is great . i did n't actually have a coffee , but i definitely enjoyed the pastries they had . there were three different kinds : chocolate dipped coconut macaroon , raspberry and chocolate <unk> . the macaroon was amazing , especially with a tall glass
2 i 'm going to rate this one -lrb- <unk> -rrb- as if i were n't there on an extremely busy night , cause otherwise it would n't stand a chance ... we decided to go on a monday night when they run a really great special on their bistro burger
4 recently , i have been to several major us cities , and in each one , i made it a point to find the best sushi i could , with varying degrees of success . one of my friends asked me , `` why have n't you found the best

4 cafe istanbul is a place that you need to <unk> yourself with before you can appreciate it . it is popular for its lunch buffet -lrb- which , we found out yesterday , is temporarily closed -rrb- , which always has a wide selection of salads , sides , meats
3 i 'm not a huge hot dog fan , but when i want a hot dog , this is where i get a hot dog . the all beef hot dog is to die for . it wo n't fill you up , unless you spend over $ 10 ,
2 the food tastes great here , but i probably wo n't eat here again . why ? first of all , the food selection was comparatively small . most indian buffets i 've been to simply have more options . next , it 's not the most flattering facility .
3 i 'm not sure what everybody is complaining about ; our service was spectacular . maybe you only get good service on the patio ? our waiter was friendly , attentive , and helpful . the food ? it was great . let 's see if i can remember what
2 of course this place makes its name as a pub , but i 'll review it as a restaurant . i stopped in here for lunch last week , as irish food sounded like a nice change of pace from the usual . the lunch menu had several appealing options
1 honey bear 's is a place that was at one point a celebrated bbq establishment , but it is now only a shell of its supposed former greatness . the setup and quality are fast food , but the prices are a notch higher . the meat tastes alright ,
4 the scallops were fresh and very tasty . a little kick to them was a good thing . the little dinner caesar salad was also very good , the garlic bread that came with was crunchy and made a great little meal . it was cinco de mayo so a
3 i was part of a huge event . there were well over 30 tables , with 10 at each in other words a packed house . we were all served the same thing , and there were <unk> courses . . maybe more ... all were very delicious and <unk>
4 i 'm hooked . on a sunday night the place was packed , but the decor was warm , the tables pleasant enough , and the booths cozy and quiet if you can get one . the menu is n't huge , and nothing looked familiar , but upon inspection
3 i 'm <unk> this review to the z ` tejas in tempe , since i like the sidewalk dining there better , but it applies equally to the one in fashion square , scottsdale . it took me a couple of visits to warm to this place , but since
3 i had to up my review a star because i realized that their huevos con chorizo skillet is one of my favorite breakfasts of all times . and we went on a tuesday at <unk> so it was n't packed and the service was good .
2 `` overpriced and adequate '' said the husband . they did n't have the food i ordered , so i settled on the cadillac burger with all the fixins . but cheese is extra and was n't melted . and by `` fixins '' they mean one leaf of lettuce
2 does the new times have a better opinion than me ? that was the question i tried to answer when i went here to try out the wings . the new times best of phoenix declared this restaurant as having the best wings , so i had to check it
1 i went here despite yelpers telling me not to bother . what did i get ? an overpriced , bland sandwich , confusion at the menu , and feeling awkward in the location . it 's an uppity cafeteria that makes you want to believe that their food is good
2 my experience at the roaring fork during restaurant week was <unk> . it 's difficult for me not to take on the <unk> of my <unk> , but i 'm going to try to limit this to my experience only . it took forever to get order our drinks and
3 i love good seafood and great martini 's and this place will not disappoint . you will need a bit of extra dough though as it 's priced as high as the quality of the food , but with every penny for a special occasion .
3 great food , nice environment with outside duck pond -lrb- romantic -rrb- service of food is slow though or i would have given 5 stars . make a reservation if planning to dine in the evening as they are extremely busy during peak tourist season .
3 update !! i bumped up their review from 3 starts to 4 ! their message to me after leaving this review was so professional i feel they deserve a second chance . a well run business means a lot especially when they listen . looking forward to the wi-fi ...

2 all i had at this place was the miso soup , 4 pieces of salmon sushi and a salmon skin hand roll . the salmon sushi was super yummy tasting and fresh despite the fact that we are in a desert - hehe . the salmon skin hand roll is
1 let me first say that i really want this place to work . i sincerely hope i am able to give a higher rating next time i go back . first , how in the world does a brewery run out of beer ???? this should never happen . the

3 great vegetarian place ! i had the <unk> with <unk> curry and the okra curry . it was delicious and especially the <unk> curry and it was just the right amount of spice and tasted what i believe to be coconut milk . i really do n't like okra but

3 i eat here at least twice a month . love that i can get a burger -lrb- and not protein style -rrb- and still be gluten free . i love the build your own with the kobe beef . baked fries for that yen that needs to be filled .
3 we found this place from a recommendation from a friend . it is a gem and we love the outdoor patio . great skinny margarita and excellent poblano enchilada no overly priced and great service
3 great place for tapas ! i really enjoy this restaurant for a couple reasons . 1 being that they change the menu constantly and 2 being that each item on the menu is always good . some are better than others , but the worst thing on their menu is
3 the stetson chopped salad is as good as a salad gets . they have a great way of preparing it at the table so you can see exactly what goes in to this creative dish . i have had the salmon and halibut , but did not love either one
3 i 've been here twice , once for happy hour and once for dinner . if you can get there early enough for happy hour and get a seat outside , it 's great . comfortable seating , interesting people watching and pretty good service . the soft pretzel &
3 this place is always consistent . for the most part the service is always good and the food always comes out quickly . i love the red bell pepper hummus with steak , it comes with pine nuts , which pita jungle has made me a huge fan of .
3 came here yesterday for a quick bite to eat and got a great sandwich ! i ordered the smoked turkey on ciabatta . the bread was very good and the turkey had a lot of flavor . the red pepper aioli spread had the perfect amount of spice to it
2 as far as arizona goes this is good seafood , but compared to other cities i 've been to where seafood restaurants are more abundant , ocean club is nothing special . i do like the ambiance of the restaurant and the service typically seems to be fine , but

3 stars are for the food ! it gets a bit backed up during the lunch rush and i could see how it would effect someones rating . i can also see how people would either love this place or not like it at all because it is a bit unique
2 i 'm not a big fan of pub food and have n't really eaten here a bunch and the food i ordered was just ok . the last time i went though , i was pleasantly surprised with the chicken wings ! they were a bit on the spicy side

3 by far my favorite place to <unk> the night away , it is the quintessential 30 something spot . an inviting patio with white <unk> <unk> , couches , and love seats , with access to the high priced bar , is a wonderful way to start the night ,

2 good food , good cocktails but no happy hour ! i would definitely recommend hanny 's as a lunch spot for downtown workers , but not sure i would make a special trip to get there . they have a large space , so it 's great for large parties
3 custom burger , fries and drink for under $ 10 ... yes , please ! i 've recently moved offices to a mere block away from lenny 's and could n't take the torture of smelling my co-workers fries anymore , so i decided to give it a try .
2 if i was to title this review , it would be `` time to <unk> up '' . when people go to mastro 's they expect first class service and food . in my experience , they just did an okay job at both . my fianc proposed to me

3 goat cheese stuffed ravioli with less than 475 calories ??? yes please ! seasons 52 is a refreshing change from the typical giant corporation restaurant . it still stands out as having a big chain vibe with the large busy restaurant , standard booths and tables , giant portions and

3 cool little pub in the neighborhood . little bit older crowd but has a great happy hour good beer selection and good food .
3 great food . great bartenders and great happy hour .
3 great food and a great happy hour . half price appetizers from 3-7 . <unk> is a great bartender and always there with a smile and there to serve . good job !!
3 nice local italian spot . nice daily specials . everything is fresh and very tasty with a nice presentation . i usually stick with the chicken parmesan . the one area they need help is with their bread .
4 i 've been here a few times and everytime it is excellent . the owners are very friendly and helpful . my favorite sandwich is the deluxe club . the thick cut bacon really makes the sandwich . you ca n't go wrong with any of their sandwiches salads or
3 this is a great place to come with a date . the sushi is very fresh and the staff is very knowledgeable and over all a great place to dine . they have some specials that are pretty good .
3 teharu is defiantly a different way to experience sushi in the valley that will keep you coming back ! the sushi is ok , its not bad by any means but it is not special either , but teharu makes up in the price and in the service ! last
3 i am always weary of new pizza places but i really enjoyed queens ! we got our pizzas to go , one pizza was just a pepperoni , and the other was along the lines of an everything pizza ; our group like the everything pizza the most . the

4 ditto what <unk> s. said . after all , we went together and had the same things and were in love with the food . basically , i would eat whatever johnny chu put in front of me . the man is a genius and i have been following him
3 great little -lrb- maybe i should say really little -rrb- irish pub with great food . if you are a jameson irish whiskey fan like me , this is the place . they serve 18 year old jameson and it is amazing . the fish and chips are really good
0 mucho gusto es much <unk> , mucho <unk> por much nada . our order : 2 fish tacos , comes with salad $ 14 . 2 chicken tacos , comes with salad $ 12 . a second round of chips is an extra dollar . the food was ok ,
2 the museum has gotten better since the remodel and will hopefully continue to get better . in the meantime , it still lacks the exhibits -lrb- and maybe <unk> -rrb- like those of other large cities like l.a. , san francisco , chicago , etc. . do n't get me
4 this is one of my favorite mexican restaurants in town . they have the <unk> menu , tacos , burritos , enchiladas , etc. , at really reasonable prices . in the years that i have been going there the food has always been delicious and everyone i have taken
4 this place is awesome . the traditional restaurant as well as the deli style restaurant inside . the assortment of food items is amazing , too many good things to choose from . and the prices are great . it is a great experience , if you like mexican food
4 soynami ... delicious ... . .
3 i usually love buffet . i usually not eat lots of meat . it is kind like a weird combo but when i finished my dinner at fogo de chao , i am satisfied - meat and buffet . i grow up with breakfast buffet every times we went on
4 this is my favorite place for tacos and guacamole . i can keep having them . the red and green salsa / sauce are good too but beware of the red one if you could not handle the heat and spicy .
1 so i was pretty excited about this burger joint opening since it 's president obama 's favorite ... the burger was good . not great , not bland , just okay . my biggest hang up with this restaurant are the prices ! skip the beverage ... it 's very

1 wish i 'd happened upon <unk> k 's review , prior to trekking in here last night , cuz the $ 14 ahi burger jump started an oddly disappointing evening . very thin <unk> patty , neither grilled not seared pink inside , but griddled grey all the way through
3 what i value about hana has as much to do with what it 's not as with what it is . it 's not a concept . there arent any <unk> or <unk> <unk> or aquariums flown in from hawaii . just quality fish prepared and served by what looks
3 i guess malee 's has been around 25 years , but it seems like fifty , and i mean that in a good way . the restaurant is both venerable and hip enough to comfortably pass as scottsdale `` special occasion '' - without breaking the bank . is it
2 atmosphere inside is kinda like a mexican version of chompies - good sized counter restaurant <unk> by market and bakery , oozing ethnic energy . more intimate -lrb- and less overwhelming -rrb- than ranch market ; a plus for tentative gringos like me . it 's a lengthy and fun
3 there 's nothing the least bit elegant about pat 's and it wont be your aunt <unk> 's cup o ' tea , but newer restaurants selling <unk> , faux authenticity look positively silly next to this guy . it 's a gritty , cramped throwback more than a <unk>
1 food is n't very tasty ... i tried several times for business lunches and was never delighted . this review is for vegetarian side of the menu .
4 oh my god . . such a wonderful place . . with tons of options and great service our family went home happy : -rrb- . usually we find it tough to find a place with both veg and non veg options plus kids options . this one fit perfectly
3 great burger spot in central phoenix . . i used to live 1 minute away . never stopped in ... finally went in yesterday . burger ... awesome ... fries ... delicious ... cherry shake ... decent you hear the term `` mom and pop '' restaurant , and this

3 quaint little noodle cafe that can become crowded as there is a steady flow of patrons going in . sit at a table or the counter , which overlooks the grilling area . the menu is somewhat distinct in that it provides asian selections as well as italian pastas .
1 unimpressive food and confusing service ! took my family there today for lunch since my 2 kids are big pizza fans and being from ny we thought it would be worth giving this a shot based on the nypd name . we started out with very confusing signage when you

3 the noodles here are so good ! i love their pot stickers . they have the perfect ratio of meat to noodle and they have a really good sauce as well . i also ordered the xo spicy noodles . the noodles were great , but the meat was not
1 i really do n't like amc very much . i prefer harkins and even cinemark to amc . so i went and saw a movie here yesterday with my mom and sister in law and it was fine , the movie was good . that really has nothing to do
3 the bf decided to take me on a date tonight -lrb- woot ! -rrb- , and we chose to try this place . i 'm really glad we did ! the place is cute , despite being in a strip mall with a dollar theatre . we had to wait
3 chase field is a decent ballpark . i like going here to see baseball games -lrb- obviously -rrb- , and most of the seats are good . the food selection is not great and is overpriced , as is pretty par for baseball fields everywhere , but if you are
2 i have been to this red devil location a few times and it has been fairly good each time . they have decent pizza , and -lrb- imo -rrb- good bruschetta , because they put the tomatoes and whatnot on garlic bread ... yum . also , they give you
1 ok ... so i have been back a few times and i have a serious problem with this place . they will not make my food spicy . for real . i order hot and the food is bland and lacking any sort of spice ... it makes no sense
3 this place redeemed itself ! i went here with my family for my birthday a few weeks ago -lrb- why go to a 3 star place for your birthday ... i do n't know , convenience ? -rrb- . anyway , i got to try many more items due to
2 i went here for lunch today as i had a groupon and had been wanting to try this restaurant for awhile . people are n't lying when they say the place runs slow ... we were there for at least an hour at lunch time with only 2-3 tables occupied
2 this place is a decent fast restaurant . i went here last night to pick up dinner with the bf . after much deliberation , he got a turkey sandwich and i got the soup and sandwich combo with the chicken pot pie soup and the chicken panini . the
3 i just picked up some pho ga from pallets for dinner tonight . i called , ordered it to go , and it was ready about 15 minutes later ... perfect ! they pack the pho up nicely in 3 separate packages , <unk> , noodles , and toppings -lrb-
4 this pizza is great , i just wish they were open more often . i have only had their pizza once , but have tried to have their pizza 4 times . they are closed at -lrb- my -rrb- dinner time , and i keep forgetting -lrb- silly me -rrb-
3 i went to del frisco 's last night to celebrate jon and amy 's birthdays . i was really happy with the way they accommodated our large group in the upstairs patio for happy hour . when we first arrived , there were n't enough seats , but as the
3 we came here last night after dinner and it was a pretty fun little bar . the drinks were inexpensive -lrb- 5 $ for a guinness and 5 $ for an amaretto sour and it was strong ! -rrb- . they have a juke box , which is fun ,
1 the bf and i went here tonight because we were going to a movie and did n't feel like mexican food -lrb- which is too bad because abuelos would have been much much better -rrb- . we wanted a lighter dinner . so he had the bbq chicken salad with
4 alright ! a really good coffee place . so , i went here on my coffee tour of phoenix -lrb- ftw -rrb- yesterday with the bf . he got a hot latte and i got an iced latte . they were both very good . the barista was also very
2 ok , so after a long night of walking around first friday , a few friends and i decided to go to reverse happy hour at moira . well , there was an hour wait to do this . however , the hostess was nice and took one of our
3 ok , so this week the bf and i decided to do a little comparison . we ate at classic italian pizza on tues. night , as we had a groupon -lrb- yay ! -rrb- , and then went to pizzeria bianco on wed night . we got to this
3 i went to the tom thumb trailhead last sunday , but when we got there , we realized that hike was a double diamond and became intimidated . we ended up walking along a bunch of the smaller trails such as the rock <unk> trail -lrb- i think that was
1 i have been here twice and i am not sure if i will be back for a third . the idea is great , it 's nice to have the option to play games and whatnot , but the place is just too busy ... maybe they should let less
4 this is a somewhat fast-food style greek and mediterranean restaurant , but the food quality is top-notch . we 've been coming here for years and find the food quality is very consistent , always great , and the portions are very generous . entree prices range from $ 7
1 this place is ok , but we probably would n't go back . the good part is the nice selection of draft beers , and good friendly service . however neither of us were impressed with our meals . i had a house burger , which was rather thin ,
3 it 's a chipotle . that means its consistent , you know what you 're getting , and it 's always fast . if you have n't been to one before and you like fresh mexican-style food , you have to try it . choose your ingredients so you get
3 neat little place with a unique and tasty house sandwich called the suicide 6 . friendly service and food was done quickly .
2 we went there for lunch last week ... and we went very early by my standards - 11:15 am . <unk> minutes later , the place was jammed , and this was on a tuesday . i ordered the mexican pizza and the other person i was with ordered their
2 my food was tasty enough , especially the shrimp taco . as others have commented on , they charge extra for everything . really , do they need to charge extra for cheese on a taco ? the portions were pretty small also . i was done with lunch in
4 so i came to red devil not sure what to expect and i left a big fan . i ordered a glass of their house riesling and was <unk> impressed with the bargain glass of wine . it was very fruity , with just the right amount of <unk> .
4 i had to come try out the central location of postino 's as i have only ever been to the arcadia location . i was not disappointed . not in the slightest ! the dcor was beautiful and mood setting , the service was attentive and friendly , my wine
3 i 'll admit it , i do n't know much about the kind of ramen that does n't come in a small dehydrated square with a silver seasoning packet , but i really , really liked my food here ! the price seems a smidge high for what you are
4 my husband and i just had the best dinner in a long time here . the service was top notch . our host and server <unk> -lrb- i 'm awful with names but i * think * that was he said his name was -rrb- was informative , attentive and
1 nope , nope , nope . i came here on the recommendation of other fellow yelpers and i am so disappointed . firstly , parking is a mess . next , i came with my husband and two year old daughter and the hostess told me that they do n't
3 wow , so the food here is pretty good , but the wait is silly . i mean it , silly . we ordered a pizza and the waiter immediately asked us if we knew it was at least 45 minutes for a thin crust and an hour for a
4 i came here for dessert after dinner at hula 's modern tiki -lrb- right across the parking lot -rrb- with my closest friends a couple of weeks ago . it was super cozy and the guy they had working the register was friendly and very cool . he even offered
1 who told carlos santana to open a restaurant chain ? between his god-awful shoe collection -lrb- apparently designed exclusively for <unk> and the <unk> -rrb- and his <unk> with rob thomas -lrb- is that guy still around ? -rrb- , i would have thought he was pretty busy . but
2 bevmo . even the name sounds lame , suburban and depressing . and it is . add in the tempe marketplace road rage -lrb- really ? is a <unk> stop that hard to figure out ? -rrb- , and you 're going to need whatever it is you 're purchasing
4 you know when you absolutely adore a restaurant and it 's like they do n't even know you exist ? like you 're in some endless john <unk> film where you never , ever get to that final birthday cake scene ? i hate <unk> love . but at haji
4 the tacos here are to die for . . the dogfish shark tacos rock . . the salsa bar is absolutely insane , lots of real spicy options . . kitchy , inexpensive , i feel a must for locals to take your tourists as that `` hole in the
4 i think as far as breakfast goes . . you can do no <unk> than the unassuming , unpretentious , and cute <unk> cafe . . had the most amazing pesto , tomato , egg muffin that was completely off the hook ... becoming one of my <unk> <unk> to

4 awesome !!! this place is amazing ... great food , great drinks , great service ... perfect !! the cucumber skinny margarita was so delicious ! the waitress was very knowledgable and so helpful . she noticed the <unk> we needed to make to our dinners and suggested an amazing
1 it is ok , nothing fantastic . definitely not the best thai food , but it would work in a bind . very average .
4 simply the best ice cream i have ever tasted . the fruit flavors are unbelievable . i may find a place to own next door just so i can walk over any time - perhaps i should say all the time - on 2nd thought maybe i should move to
4 <unk> year old small house turned into a wonderfully inviting small restaurant . we were n't too hungry so shared 3 appetizers - a smoked salmon spring roll , firecracker shrimp and crispy calamari , and finished sharing a ginger creme brulee . everything delicious - even the <unk> sitting
4 they are moving to ground at the old cheuvront 's ! september 23 !
4 cindy <unk> has created a large part of her dream here and with the outdoor market . many phoenicians ' dreams have been wonderfully fulfilled as well - i can tell - the aisles are becoming too narrow . it keeps getting better - the chefs , the selection ,
4 i do n't get to the <unk> often enough , so this place is a bit o ' for me : just enough $ $ spent on keeping the <unk> from shutting the place down , the rest of the <unk> <unk> goes into the owners ' pockets . i
1 food 's mediocre for dinner . i kind of enjoyed doing dim sum here though . my man is an abc -lrb- american born chinese -rrb- and he thought the food was meh .
2 a unique burger joint with a humorous experience . did n't go for the food , went for the experience . i walked in and grabbed a seat at the bar . the friendly head <unk> gives you a <unk> <unk> and dresses you in a hospital gown . there
3 i got the sicilian thin crust pizza . yum . <unk> for a small sized pizza -lrb- radius about 5 '' , so 10 '' <unk> -rrb- . my man says the strawberry limeade was good , + they give free refills . cute holiday themed to-go box . kind
1 got soft tofu soup . they mixed up our order . my bf thought his soup was bland while i was burning up and breathing fire lol . the food was mediocre , aside from the <unk> . priced a lot higher than what its worth . small portions .
0 do not get the buckwheat noodles here . so not authentic and a lot of the stuff does n't taste good . spend your money somewhere else .
3 <unk> indoors . so i sat outdoors . it was 100 + degrees outside . it was comfortably cool with the <unk> and misters and fans . the only annoyance sitting outside was the huge disgusting fly that kept charging at my food and landing on it . : -lrb-
4 i had to finally give la condesa -lrb- recently changed their name to <unk> tacos -rrb- the five stars they deserve . this place is my jam . we eat here all the time and believe me when i say that their santa condesa veggie taco is the best you
3 thai house is a 2 minute drive from my work . i eat here probably 2 or 3 times a month and have never been disappointed . i 'm a vegetarian , and they have a lunch special just for me ! mixed vegetables with tofu -lrb- i usually get
3 i can -lrb- and sometimes do -rrb- eat here two or more times a week . their salsa bar is the best -lrb- pecan , mexicana , cilantro are my favorite -- i still have n't tried their strawberry salsa everyone raves about as it 's not in season -rrb-
3 i came here once before to grab a bowl of warm ramen for a sick friend , and only had their thai milk tea boba -lrb- which is really great -rrb- . i came back last night with a group of friends and had their vegetarian broth ramen with zucchini
4 i 've always been happy with green wasabi . one of my favorite sushi places . i love their special rolls . who would n't want to order the climax ? their service is amazing . their sashimi is one of the freshest i 've tried . mackerel is always
4 its like a crack addiction . try it once , and you get hooked . i had some last night at the scottsdale location and decided to come here after lunch today to get my fix . we got there right at 12pm and they werent open yet . about
4 we came back today to get the <unk> sandwich . when we arrived , i took a look at the market sandwich of the day and it looked delicious so i got that instead . today the market sandwich was roasted pork belly , balsamic onions and some <unk> .
4 due to a heavy <unk> neighbor upstairs in our hotel , i was up and about around 6am . i knew i needed some coffee and donuts . dunkin donuts is right near my hotel so i went and got a cup of coffee there . then headed here to
0 this place was blaring counting <unk> . i could n't even stay for the drink i ordered . i ran , everybody , i ran out .
1 sky bar , <unk> candies , and naughty soda drinks . let us review : sky bar , a delicious treat from the <unk> factory -lrb- the place that makes the chalky valentine hearts that say stuff like `` <unk> me '' and `` text me ur heart '' -rrb-
3 after smoca opening night , i just wanted to relax with some friends and not go get wasted or have to wait a long time to get a seat at a trendy bar on a friday night . oh yeah , and get something to eat . i had remembered
3 i am ashamed . i have not been eating here when i have easy access to it . i remember when i finally went in there this past saturday , that i had stopped by this place when i first moved to arizona and really wanted a <unk> i think
3 confession number one : it is all erica 's fault . she invited me over here after work one day and i said , `` you mean time out lounge , right ? are you joking monkey pants ? normally that is said like a punch line ... right ?
3 late on a friday night and most places either closing at 9 or so packed the chance of a nice date evening would be <unk> against <unk> or <unk> <unk> boy <unk> to do ? sushi eye is open till 10pm and like a ten minute ride away ? lets
3 i went for a long walk today wearing my winter wear of light coat , long sleeves , jeans and boots ... oh and a tiny light scarf , with the sun shining in the weather just cold enough . i like the <unk> at night too -lrb- oh what
2 huh . that is my impression of merc bar . huh . thank god i had stevey to lead me to this <unk> really would have never found it on my own . seriously . from the whole parking garage thing to the walking around like an outdoor mall plaza
4 first impression : i read so much about casey moore 's on yelp that i asked my bro about it , so we headed over there this past weekend night . i could n't believe how huge it was ! or how i did n't know about it on my
3 having been such a fan of <unk> in <unk> , ma and <unk> , <unk> , i was so stoked to see a tea place had opened up in tempe . unfortunately it happens to be in the tempe marketplace aka suburban <unk> , it is near the bookstore and
3 <unk> . adjacent to changing hands bookstore , this small local change is fantastic , a great accompaniment to <unk> and a great location -lrb- guadalupe and mcclintock -rrb- for a break from errands -lrb- or in my case , riding my <unk> around here is usually when i need
4 i live in the area and have been going to joe 's bbq since they opened 10 + years ago . so ... i guess i should review it , but this mainly a me , too review . great meat , fun place , tasty sides , good for
3 love this place - you can get a good `` hardcore '' coffee or a nice , tasty mocha . it also gets a nice blend of clients , and i never see it too full of hipsters or too full of laptops . a great independent business - stop
2 been to giant twice now , and both times had a good but not memorable visit . big plus is the ambiance and overall look of the place . i bet it is simply fantastic when they can open the front <unk> in the evening and let the cool air
3 went here after an ignite phoenix event and had a fantastic time with friends on the balcony upstairs . ate some ridiculously tasty animal fries and had several drinks . everyone in our party got their food very fast , and it was all quite good . not sure i
1 `` we can say we tried it . '' that was our reaction when we left . we drive by this place all the time , and it is usually packed , so when we had an open night we decided to see what it was all about . we
3 the best pizza in the valley . hands down . yes , i know , there is bianco in the same city . i would rather go to the parlor , ditch the long wait at bianco , sit in their green house patio , and , still have a
2 this was our go to place for thai food . not only because it is so close to home , but also , because the service was great , ingredients were fresh and the food was tasty ; sadly , none of which i can vouch for anymore . i
1 went here in one of those moments - `` i am too much of a food snob . chains ca n't be that bad . '' -lrb- 1 -rrb- well , they can . -lrb- 2 -rrb- i would rather be a snob than walk through their smelly bar for
3 there 's something about olive & ivy that makes me want to go back . sadly , its not the food , as much as i wish it was . yet , i go back . -lsb- sometimes , it is for food . those lamb meatballs are not meant
4 i am changing my review to 5 stars . i was back in last night to buy a couple whole rainbow trout to throw on the grill . this place is the best for fresh seafood . i also think it is rad that they offer `` courtesy ice ''
0 i was really excited to try this place . it smelled unbelievably good in here like really good barbeque or bacon or something like that . it was all we could do to sit patiently while our table was set up . unfortunately that is where the visit turned for
2 sushi ... fast food style . basically a step above the sushi at fry 's but good if you want a quick , cheap meal .
3 i wandered into chloe 's corner because it was in a convenient location and i was starving . admittedly , i was n't expecting much . it 's cute but it looks like a standard deli , chalkboard menus and all . i was pleasantly surprised with my lunch .
3 great discovery for me ! i popped in for lunch and was pleasantly surprised . i had the best veggie tacos ever ! they were extremely flavorful and filling . i do n't know the secret to the accompanying rice and beans but they were also on point ... just
4 i visited veneto trattoria for the first time at lunch today . what a pleasant surprise ! i love the cozy atmosphere of this quaint restaurant and the attentiveness of the wait staff . of course , the food was divine ! i highly recommend the salmon salad , if
2 i know everyone has raved about this place . so naturally , i was was super excited to try it . i do n't know if it was just so hyped up or what , but it just seemed like a normal pizza to me ... with a really long
2 this place was just built right by me , so naturally , i was stoked to go ! i had never heard of rudy 's but there seemed to always be the longest line ever to get in . needless to say , i had to try it ! once
3 super cute little joint ! i loved bliss rebar 's outdoor patio . it was such a perfect evening to sit outside and enjoy the atmosphere . i never did make it inside to see the rest of it , but there were a few short and tall tables on
3 best time to go is for happy hour . they have great food and drink specials during happy hour although it gets fairly filled up quick . if you go on a friday you will have to get there somewhat early . the patio is nice to people watch since
4 brio has a great happy hour . it is only valid in the bar and patio area , but the weather is perfect to sit outside right now and it makes for great people watching . you ca n't go wrong with the tuscan tasters for $ 3.95 each .
2 i grew up in kentucky and had never heard of five guys . all my friends here were soooo excited when they saw the `` coming soon '' sign on mill ave. so , as a serious burger lover , i got my hopes up and couldnt wait to check
3 a typical trade in store , although bigger than most ive been to . i like this one better than their other locations mostly because the college kids tend to stay out of it so there 's actually stuff worth buying by the time i roll out of bed .
4 this is a `` go to '' spot for us . always . i have never , ever had one complaint about an experience or the food and i have had the pleasure of coming here for 5 + years regularly -lrb- weekly ? -rrb- . great for lunch ,
1 here 's the deal - as far as food goes , this place deserves 5 stars , its inventive , fresh , mexican food and always amazing . the location is great and i would love to frequent it . however , the owner <unk> <unk> always comes off as
2 <unk> is good and the chick pea pancakes are amazing ... however , this place has a little <unk> problem -lrb- flies -rrb- very annoying ! and their system of giving you a number and then bringing your food to you is an absolute mess , both times ive been
3 salt and pepper wings are f 'n amazing . mahi fish tacos for $ 2 on tuesday 's are one of the best deals in scottsdale period . the mexican food was enjoyable as well but i come here for the wings and the tacos .
4 lowest prices on everything . period . i save an average of 5-10 dollars a bottle compared to other stores . excellent selection
3 honestly , i have n't been to the new location yet but am looking forward to it since the last one was a little over crowded and hectic on the weekends , but the food made it worth it . the quality of the food is great and gives you
3 thus far the best thai food i have come across here in arizona . i have now visited a few times and have enjoyed the chicken panang curry , tom kha soup , and drunken noodles with tofu . i have found the `` spiciness '' scale to be accurate
3 fez was the destination for a late lunch for my friend , <unk> and myself . our target : sweet potato fries , which were very good as expected . they came with a sauce that you did n't even need . it was def a mysterious sauce that we
3 first of all i am overly excited that scottsdale mall has added this lovely addition of an west wing . i was starting to think that neiman 's was as good as it would get * <unk> * barneys ! my wallet just ca n't contain itself . anyways the
2 ok seriously phoenix , you do n't know a bad <unk> world until you 've shopped the one in el mirage ... k ? with that cleared . this place is n't bad at all . -lrb- i mean in all honesty the true danger is the parking lot !
3 wow a place where i can eat what i 've been putting on my face all this time . dr. weil 's magic <unk> . his <unk> diet is great if you 're <unk> ... i 'm not , but i like the hummus and veggies for 8 bucks .
3 4.5 stars -- why are n't there half stars ??!! c4 was really good . i had the bacon cheese burger and it was cooked to my exact request . my dinner guests had the chorizo mac n cheese and that was really really good ! we had the appetizer
3 i had lunch at wally 's on a day when i wanted to eat healthier -- let 's just say , that day was shot i had to call for a <unk> the next day . but oh , my wally burger was good ! very laid back and easy
3 congratulations to all you fit people or wan na be fit people -- i <unk> you on running , walking , skipping whatever it is that you do to finish a marathon or a 1/2 marathon . i actually had to drive to work this sunday to get something off
2 i 've had different experiences at this macayo 's . it was hard to give the amount of stars on this one . all times i have eaten a meal at macayo 's , the food has arrived in 8 minutes or less of when i ordered -- this is
0 here 's a <unk> one for you . picture this ... <unk> , highschool , floating down the salt river with a light buzz -lrb- who does n't drink on the river ? even 7 year olds are plastered -rrb- and my friend asks me what <unk> to my leg
2 did a <unk> in and pick up order . ordering was easy and picking up was even easier -- they had the food ready and lunch for 5 people was about $ 40 ! that 's pretty cheap considering it was 4 sandwiches with sides -lrb- small itty bitty sides
3 i attended a private party in the speakeasy . it was quite a fantastic set up ! super cozy and intimate with a decent sized patio and pool table . television , couches , chairs . it was really great . the ordering was a bit confusing , there was
3 ice cream and candy <unk> galore ! after dining at windsor , simply take a few steps on over to churn for some homemade out of this world super creamy ice cream . it 's like a mini candy store filled with cookies and ice cream . the staff happily
1 guacamole was the the highlight of this meal . the good friends dining with me too but that was pretty much it . the a/c was not working correctly so it was unpleasant inside , my group considered going to a different restaurant in tempe market place but stayed since
2 cafe zu zu has been a decent place for larger groups . most times the service has been spot on but the last time i was there -lrb- 2 weeks ago -rrb- the service was slow . we were sitting outside and the inside looked pretty dead . i think
4 how does in n out do it ? the consistency is amazing . the service is impeccable . do these happy <unk> teens really love their jobs ? does upper management <unk> them with happiness cola on their breaks ? i do n't get it . but this is what
3 really great tacos ! the fish and carne asada tacos taste fresh and delicious , al <unk> small , but they are only $ 2 each so order as many as you like ! the chips and <unk> are perfect ! i love thick crunchy not too greasy but just
4 happy hour until 7pm - this is fantastic , many places end hh at 6pm so this was a nice bonus . 1/2 price appetizers as well . we had the deviled eggs , lamb chops and chicken wings . it was a lot of food with a lot of
2 this place was it , but it seemed to have lost it 's special touch . -lrb- cellar review -rrb- i ordered the quesadilla -- big mistake , not good . <unk> . it was micro sized and mega priced . $ 16 for a steak quesadilla that seriously did
3 chips and salsa -lrb- 2 kinds -rrb- and bean dip all while you wait for your food . do n't bother ordering appetizers , the chips and dips will satisfy you . if you like margaritas , order the jumbo marg and sit in the nice air conditioned room .
2 we just popped in here for some lunch . it was n't great . we ordered hummus to start with . the hummus was okay , but i did n't love the pita . i prefer the pitas that are used at pita jungle for lunch i ordered a small
4 we got there early , probably an hour and a half before they opened . thankfully the bar next door opens an hour before . the time went by quickly and luckily we were the last people to be sat when they opened ! the food was absolutely delicious !
2 i had to wait until noon for the store to open , but the <unk> was extremely nice . it 's very clean inside . i looked around at everything , but i do n't think it 's got much for me . tons of rocker , <unk> , california
4 i loved this place !! first , my drink was delicious ! i ordered the bellini and it was definitely one of the best that i 've ever had -- kind of <unk> , but so good ! the bread and butter was hot and delicious ! i did n't
3 solid place for happy hour . the california and <unk> maki rolls were good . salmon and yellowtail sashimi were solid . nice prices until 7pm . good music .
4 i stopped in here again one day after lunch . i had a craving for some really good chocolate for dessert . the dark chocolate cake ball was awesome . super rich melt in my mouth goodness . i also bought a dark chocolate <unk> bar to go . that
3 i 've been here a dozen times and have only had the seafood enchiladas . they are that good . plenty of shrimp and fish served with a creamy green enchilada sauce . the grilled red and green peppers and rice round out the dish . plenty of chips and
3 my buddy and i were in the mood for some red meat so we decided to head over to the grind . i was surprised by the dark , modern decor . i liked it a lot and thought the long narrow layout made it feel like i was in
3 i met a cute yelp friend for lunch at liberty market yesterday . i 'd heard about liberty for a couple of years now and was really looking forward to checking it out . parking can be a little tough but once inside the building the fun begins . the
3 stopped in this am for a cup of coffee . it was only 50 cents and it tasted great !
2 if you are obese , or desire to become obese , then this is your place ! it 's all here . big greasy burgers , loads of fries and tons of soda . it all tastes great . if that 's not enough , be sure to grab some
2 nice neighborhood wine bar . big pours . not much in the way of food .
3 large library with the best <unk> in the valley outside of burton barr library in phoenix . sometimes tough to get on one of the computers . nice to grab a magazine or newspaper to read in one of the easy <unk> with a view of the mall .
2 sandwich ordering process is a little <unk> . that being said my grinder on whole wheat was very good .
3 i 've been here a few times and really like this place . the decor is super cool and the music is great . the mussels appetizer was very good and the tongue in cheek main dish is excellent as well . i had quite a few of their indian
3 i 've been here many times . this last visit i ordered something different - the fish and chips . really nice fish and perfectly fried . the tartar sauce was just right . washed down with the nectar of the gods -lrb- kiltlifter -rrb- and i 'm a happy
3 sometimes you just got ta have a burger . i was in the scottsdale <unk> area and noticed this place where nick 's used to be . i tasted their burger at the scottsdale culinary festival 's burger battle and thought it was really good . the cb & cb
2 sunday we were heading to switch but decided to stop at fez instead . i guess you could say we `` switched '' our plan ? fez has a nice atmosphere and friendly service . we both ordered a sam adams and shared a plate of hummus . the hummus
3 this is a very nice contemporary italian restaurant . we were here last week for dinner and enjoyed the experience . our burrata <unk> appetizer was very good . the burrata was nice and creamy and rich and was delicious spread on their bread . the service was attentive throughout
2 this place is still going strong after all these years . the decor is beautiful and the bar area is a fun place to hang out . this last visit i just had a cup of coffee and an ok butter or olive oil cake for dessert .
3 the food and service are fantastic ! i had the chicken and prosciutto wrap and a lemonade . i loved the combination of ingredients in the wrap especially the slight hint of mustard and fig . of course lemonade tastes great when it 's 105 degrees ! unfortunately , i
3 i 've been to the new place a couple of times now for happy hour . love the crab cake and the pot stickers are good too . a little bit of an older crowd . get here by 5 pm to get a seat at the bar .
4 i 've been hiking here for many years . i am addicted to the summit trail and occasionally hike the <unk> trail . it 's a great workout and offers nice views of phoenix . the summit trail can get really busy on the weekends . fortunately , with the
2 i was in here this week for happy hour . rather than ordering the special of the day i went with the pulled pork sandwich and a side of baked beans . the pulled pork was ok but the beans were fantastic . they have a nice selection of beers
2 i small group of us went here saturday night . it only took a couple of minutes for them to seat us in a nice area with couches and a table . it was kinda like hanging out at home with friends except the wine selection is much better !
3 big place with a lot to chose from . four stars for their rack of lamb and outstanding wine selections .
3 always consistently good . this last visit i had the thai steak and noodle salad . i think it 's my new favorite !
0 slow <unk> ? ate here three times . sampled a couple interesting beers in the bottle . a couple appetizers and desserts . over priced for what you get but i expected that . that 's par for most of the places feeding off the resort . the last time
2 i happened on this place on a sunday afternoon . they had an irish music jam session going and some of the patrons were dancing a <unk> . honest ! good tap beer selection . good fish n chips , good service . unbelievably good atmosphere when the jam session
1 ate dinner here for the first time a couple of days ago . combo dinner w / green chilli . no draft mex beers . ok food just not the kind of mexican food i like . i like my corn chips covered with salt , hot and greasy ,
2 really , it 's a 2.5 but i 'll bump it up to three for the roasted beet and goat cheese salad which was very good and the white sangria . it 's just an overpriced cheesecake factory without the cheesecake . i went in on a friday late evening
3 this was my first taste of vietnamese and this was a <unk> introduction to the cuisine . the decor is very modern and classy without feeling cold or unfriendly . i did like that there seemed to be a lot of regulars in the place which <unk> well , to
4 bathroom doors are fixed ! <unk> -lrb- i probably just <unk> her poor name -rrb- has now been our server twice and she is excellent ! we had bottle service on saturday for a birthday party and she was great , attentive and made sure no one was ever thirsty
3 we stopped in here after dinner in the area . even though we 'd already eaten , i always like to look at menus to see if it 's a place worth coming to for food . their menu looked excellent with some very unique takes on typical bar food
3 very , very good . service both at the bar and table was impeccable . our server knew the menu very well and made excellent suggestions . their unique cocktails were excellent and a decent price for a decent pour . we enjoyed the <unk> board to start and then
3 has a lovely decore and ambiance . we had questions about wine and we were helped by a wine expert , who nailed what we were looking for on the first try . food was pretty good , i had the sea bass - i loved the brussel sprouts with
2 i love this place 's prices - and usually their wide variety - can not be beat . but 2x now i 've discovered ants in my home shortly after shopping there thanks to produce left on the counter . and i hate ants . so i 'm just going
3 i like this spot ! i 've been to dilly dally twice and each time i 've had a good time . this is a place you go when you just want to grab a beer , maybe watch or play some shuffleboard , and shoot the breeze while listening
4 *** i gave this 5 stars based on the best mexican food i 've had in az , not based on white linen and waiter service , just an fyi *** i wo n't write too much as it seems that everyone already has . both locations are great .
3 kobe hamburger with pretzel bread . that 's all you need to know ! yeah , i 'm a fan ! i visited daily dose on whiskey wednesday . that means $ 5 whiskeys . after one of those , i just had to eat something ! well , hello
3 have you ever walked into a place and said to yourself `` oh ... i 'm going to have a lot of fun here ! '' it happened to me on saturday night . i <unk> into char 's buzzing off of patron and was immediately hit by a dose
3 i love , love scramble ! i do n't know what it is about the place ! is it the sleek and simple decor ? hmm , is it the friendly , attentive service ? is it the <unk> yum food ? perhaps all of the above make me a
3 i 'm officially in love with sol y sombra . i was n't sure if i had room in my heart to love another tapas place , but turns out i 'm shameless and can love many at one time . my visit to sol y sombra was on a
3 i love going to amsterdam to mingle with my lovely gays and dance my booty off . i really like the way this place is decorated . the drinks are slightly pricey but worth it . i do n't think i 've had a bad pour there . i wo
3 mmmm ... thai lahna . thai lahna is the person you spy from across the room that you 're not too sure about but then after talking to them you find out that they 're pretty damn cool . yeah , that 's my thai lahna . my group walked
3 mmm ... pita jungle . i had been craving it all week and finally my lunch buddies decided they wanted to go . this location is busy at lunch time ; full of corporate type as well as families with children -lrb- bad idea to bring kids at lunchtime ,
3 did arcadia tavern for lunch and discovered a fantastic spot ! sports bar meets applebees . the burgers are definitely worth the trip ! complementary valet , mouth watering menu , and great genuine service , love this chill spot , i 'm a new fan ! : -rrb-
2 so after checking this place out i 've decided it three stars . -lrb- ahh , please do n't come after me !! lol -rrb- . i think it 's pretty cute and the coffee is delicious , however with all the other little coffee joints around cenpho , it
4 the mexican food gods and <unk> have possessed the <unk> bodies of the people who work in the los reyes de la torta kitchen to grace us with their magical food . i swear every time i eat here i am transported to another realm of taste bud <unk> .
1 ugh . . myst is basically just myst . it 's really nice inside , especially on the ballroom side , however this place is douche wannabe central . half of the guys here look like they rolled up alone and give off uber creepy vibe . the main dance
3 wow , looks like this makes review # 700 for postino 's ! i 'm sure by now you all have heard of the great monday night deal which includes a bottle of wine and their yummy bruschetta , and it does n't really matter what kind of bruschetta you
3 if pigging out at casino buffets is wrong , i do n't wan na be right . my favorite casino in the area , there is a really good buffet called wandering horse , a swanky lil piano bar , and of course , the pool club . fun for
4 stellar <unk> . this place has everything i look for in a club . great service , good management , great drinks , great crowd , sexy ambiance , dance floor that 's not overly crowded & clean bathrooms . ; -rrb- the music was a lil old school but
3 one of the good things about living in n phoenix is being close to <unk> . lol - -lrb- half kidding -rrb- it 's huge . so many options for dinner . my usual spots for hh or dinner are sandbar and the keg . other usual spots are target
3 i love <unk> ! its like the `` cheers '' of scottsdale , but everybody does n't know my name there yet . got ta try the <unk> . great place for happy hour , and to watch a game . can get crowded , hard to find a seat
4 you know how some people say that those little mom & pops `` hole-in-the-wall '' restaurants make the best food ? well , this is that place . seriously , words ca n't express how much i love pupusas , and choices are limited here in phoenix , but this
2 good location , nice setup , but was n't super impressed with the food . excellent service and the mechanical bull was calling my name ... but think i 'll save my <unk> for next time , after a few jack n cokes !
2 very average place . its part of hyatt hotel , and totally looks like a hotel bar/restaurant . if your in the area , and your starving , or if your staying in the hotel , it will do . service was not very friendly , overall very `` meh
3 one of my favorite breakfast places . heads up , to prevent sticker shock on your check ... expect $ 20 per person . some people do n't think that you should have to pay $ 20 for breakfast . then again , this is n't denny 's . the
0 the location really hurts this theater -lrb- being in a mall -rrb- . 2 things will be guaranteed with this experience : crowds and kids . things that can ruin any <unk> experience . additional tip : assuming it 's because of the mall location , but this harkins theater
3 i 've been here for lunch twice . i 'll be back ! for some reason , and i have no clue why , there are n't many great options for asian buffets here in scottsdale . this place works for me . great variety , traditional dishes , very
0 i used to love this place when it first opened . it was a great afternoon hangout with friends . they had great happy hour pricing , and great music -lrb- especially the old <unk> videos showing on the tv 's -rrb- . the food was really good as well
3 so ... full ... the portions are great , the rolls are even better ... ca n't stop coming to this place ... try the meatloaf ! and btw - do n't be afraid of the veggie skewers ... they are awesome !
3 it only loses a star for always being way too crowded . i know , that 's a crappy way to lose a star , but if i ca n't park and always have to wait in line you do n't get 5 stars !
3 a breakfast menu that breaks away from the ordinary and trite dishes to give your taste buds a small adventure . we all enjoyed our meals thoroughly but one guy with us was upset that his butter was n't soft enough . i feel his pain , but that 's
0 wow this place has gone down hill big time . used to be that the sushi was ok for a quick sushi fix but now it is barely passable as sushi not nasty old fish . i came in and ordered the sushi combo -lrb- 6 assorted nigiri and a
4 calling all stoners , calling all stoners . well ok not just stoners because the food here is awesome for those of us who are n't stoners too . the menu names will make you feel like you are breaking the law just by ordering a la <unk> blunt or
3 i could just copy my review from skeptical chymist as they are both sister pubs and both very good and both seahawks bars . i have come here twice now both for seahawks games . all the food has been good especially the corned beef hash breakfast and my favorite
1 after reading the glowing reviews here on yelp my gf and i tried this place out this morning . the result was not what we were hoping for . i was deciding between a couple things for breakfast and when i asked the waitress for a recommendation she did n't
2 for as much hype as this place got from my friends i was expecting some sort of flavor explosion to occur when i ate here . instead what i got was a wait in a place with limited ac in az in the <unk> for what was essentially a ton
4 came here as part of a uye set up by norm and i am really glad i made it . this place is n't your run of the mill chinese food . it is authentic -lrb- according to norm -rrb- and full of unique flavors that differ from the chains
1 groupon : fail . new york : fail . deli : fail . i am pretty sure most new yorkers would try this place an tell you to <unk> and leave it at that but a yelper shares . i judge a deli on a few things : the meat
3 usually come here on friday nights with my friends who are regulars . food is pretty solid the lamb meatballs and johnny 's nachos are very popular with our group . even their ranch dressing is really good and i am not a big ranch fan . i also like
2 i have a love hate relationship with hob nobs . let 's start with the love . it 's within walking distance from my house , which is super convenient . secondly , this place is adorable . it 's located in a lovingly restored historic home , and there
4 love postino , best bruschetta ... ever . go on monday or tuesday after 8 and you can get a giant sampler of it and a bottle of wine for $ 20 . love their brunches , love their location , love the free valet parking . it 's basically
4 i too was eagerly awaiting this place 's arrival . i 'm a sucker for both coffee and lola tapas , so naturally i was intrigued . it was well worth the wait , even on the first day of business . great , smooth espresso and awesome pastries from
2 as far as chain breakfast spots go , this is n't half bad . i 'd pick it over the good egg for dcor alone , which is much less country kitchen and more ... well ... this location looks kind of strange . it 's like walking into an
2 i went here on a cold night around the holidays and it provided the warmth i needed . the front room is pretty hokey , and i 'm not sure i 'd like dining in there . but the back room , the `` lounge '' area , is much
2 it 's hard to beat $ 1 mimosas and <unk> on a saturday or sunday morning . that being said , switch is one of my good friends . it 's really airy and open , and just like fez , the house music is blasting at 10 a.m. .
2 it 's expensive . it 's smaller than most aj 's . but guess what ? there 's not many places like this in central phoenix . it 's hard to get quality cuts of meat , great veggies and over-priced flowers any closer to downtown , so i 'll
3 the most delicious soup i 've ever eaten , period . tommy bahama crab bisque . imagine a stick of butter with crab flavor and a delightful crostini -- there it is , the tommy bahama crab bisque . so rich , so buttery , so wonderful . if you
4 monday night was a big one for me . first , after a weekend of <unk> and <unk> and promises and <unk> , my wife finally <unk> and allowed me to waste tons of money we do n't have on two shiny new iphones . so we were at biltmore
4 a hangar cafe haiku : butter colored grease magical , <unk> pond on plate , in body the japanese really had something going with these haiku . if it is n't worth saying in 17 <unk> , is it really worth saying at all ? true , this is contrary
4 because someone yelled at me for <unk> out stars like candy , i now feel guilty when i give out five stars for a restaurant i 've only visited once . do they deserve the fifth star ? was it an <unk> ? will i look douchey to someone else
3 monday <unk> : <unk> eat lunch at office deli . chili dog with onions . bad idea . <unk> mouth tastes like crap . drink water . <unk> <unk> 5 with this breath thing . more water <unk> decide i want something sweet and delicious to rid myself of this
4 oh my f * ing phenomenal . yesterday i went to fez and sat on the patio . thank god it was n't vegetarian day because i had the spiritual <unk> on ciabatta that is otherwise listed as the <unk> burger . that 's right , i got that burger
3 i have been to the cove twice now ; once for a dinner uye and once for lunch with a group of <unk> after we got our <unk> in the same plaza . i 'm really excited that they have gluten free options , both in pizza and in pasta
3 wow . i was really shocked at how much i enjoyed nick 's considering it is inside a strip mall ! i figured it would be more of a low-key type place , but it was really nice inside and the food was fantastic . the only complaint i have
4 after my third trip to <unk> wong , i thought it was time to write the raving review it so obviously deserves , even despite the fact that they do not serve alcohol ! hot pot is basically fondue with a soup broth instead of cheese . it is an
2 overrated . the treats are tasty but certainly not the best i have ever had . i would have rated this a two star but the cakes and cookies are really pretty . the design makes up for the lack of taste . over priced too . fortunately for them
3 the <unk> sandwich is amazing . they have a very limited menu , but once you try the food , you will eat there regularly . all outdoor seating , and they have limited hours , so make sure you check the hours before you head out there .
3 zen32 is my favorite place to get sushi . i have been here at least a dozen times over the years and have never had an <unk> experience . i am not the best sushi critic being that i am vegetarian , but i think they have pretty good veggie
4 it is an honor to be the first to review this brand new green location ! just like green tempe , the menu provides an array of delicious vegan treats ranging from salads to flatbread pizzas to <unk> , po boys , and bowls filled with various varieties of mock
2 i have been waiting to try lalibela for a few weeks and was extremely excited to hit the cafe up last night . i must say , i was a tad disappointed . we had great service . my drink was never dry and we got our food really quickly
1 arizona mills has the worst bathrooms i have ever been in . they are always really , really smelly and warm . i like that there are outlet stores , so you can save a lot of money , but at the same time some of the stores they have
4 my only complaint about short leash is that they do n't follow me around town in the food cart , which means i can not eat delicious hot dog concoctions all day ! how unfair is that ?!? well , amber ... we all know you are a vegan ,
2 ahhhh man , i really wanted to like this place more than i did . i guess i would really give it a 3.5 versus a 3 ... but we all know there are no half points here . . as everyone else already mentioned , the parking in front
2 eh . i 'm giving wildflower a 3 star because i was really underwhelmed at the breakfast food here . it was relatively bland and overpriced . the bread was good , but the eggs and potatoes were not . i tried the pumpkin carmel latte and it was probably
4 it is really hard to rate la grande orange because there are so many amazing things about it , but it is so hard to find parking . pros the food is really , really amazing they have an awesome selection of things you wont see day to day they
4 i love the light rail . i mean , love , the light rail . first off , it takes me less than 2 minutes to drive to the nearest stop . . 44th and washington ... and when weather permits , i can easily ride a bike there ...
4 i have absolutely fallen <unk> in love with hula 's for so many reasons ! let 's just go over a few : - the amazing tofu tacos - the `` i 'm - <unk> '' scorpion bowl -lrb- they light the <unk> on fire ! -rrb- - the kick
2 i was in the unfortunate circumstance this past weekend of having to wake up at <unk> to drive and pick up my bountiful basket from ahwatukee . to help <unk> the sleep , i decided to grab an iced coffee from the king of coffee , dunkin donuts . as
4 chipotle is the best business model of the 21st century , and this location wholly embodies the chipotle perfection . chipotle uses naturally raised meats , hormone free dairy , no eggs or nuts , organic beans , seasonal produce , and promote recycling within the restaurants . this means
4 i am writing this update because i learned something new and incredible : <unk> has a dance area . i have been coming here for about 4 years off and on , and i have always sat at the bar completely unaware that there is an awesome dance <unk> attached
3 good basic mexican food . nothing fancy and sometimes that is a good thing . service is great , prices are reasonable , an the food is exactly what you expect . full drink menu that you would expect to get at a basic mexican restaurant . when your in
3 i was driving up scottsdale rd. on the way to my one guilty pleasure that i have in-and-out , to have my once a month double double . i looked up and saw the 5 guys sign , made a quick turn , and decided to go there instead after
3 i really enjoy this restaurant . i am a fan of greek food and very much enjoy the dolmades and chicken gyros . i did not give this restaurant 5 stars because the food does lack slightly in flavor in my opinion . overall , the service and the food
4 i have been eating at this nello 's location for the last 15 years . the pizzas here are awesome and always piping hot . the owner brian is friendly and willing to make your experience better if it is lacking which it never is at this nello 's .
2 i have been here twice now with friends . i ca n't tell if i enjoy it or not . the place has a really relaxed vibe to it , which is actually enjoyable . i actually enjoy the decor and <unk> atmosphere . what i do n't get is
2 this is a totally a dive bar with an overall laid back atmosphere . the bar in itself is really cool . but from time to time i run into the scottsdale douchebaggery that i can not get away from !! but with that this is totally a place where
4 ok so this will be a <unk> review of fnb and you will understand what i mean by this shortly . i came here last night for my first time . first let me tell you that fnb is closed on tuesday nights but will open for private events ,
4 ahhh , a breath of fresh air ! being from ma , a highly populated italian state , i grew up going to italian groceries like this , and it made me a bit home sick . a tiny little establishment inundated with products and heck they were even able
4 what a fantastic music store !! they carry every type of music in here , as well as dvds , records , posters , toys , <unk> , and apparel . what i really love about zia is that they carry metal music . i usually can not find any
2 as i was heading to san tan village today with my parents to do some holiday shopping , we were all throwing out ideas of where to eat . i suggested that we try joe 's farm grill . i have been hearing about this place for years , seen
3 perfect date spot . cute wine bar with tasty menu , good wine list and delightful ambiance . enclosed <unk> patio out front is fantastic . bruschetta is tasty and ranges from light to heavy , something for everyone . would order all the below again : smoked salmon /
2 a bit too sweet -lrb- sweeter than yogurtland and red mango -rrb- , but liked the skinny mango and blueberry flavors , excellent spread of toppings -lrb- incl . green tea mochi -rrb- and great quality fruit . perfect <unk> on mill .
0 i 've been to ra a few times and the sushi is alright . i usually go for the happy hour drinks because the specials are good . the last time i went though the service was horrible . my cousin and i sat down and the server came up
3 there is nothing better than a lazy sunday at postino . actually , there is nothing better than a lazy any day at postino . the food is great , the wine is great and the service is -lrb- usually -rrb- great . along with the bruschetta , which is
3 i thoroughly enjoyed my experience at deseo . the food was outstanding and the mojitos , which i am usually not a fan of , are amazing and compliment the food so well . i have only been once but hopefully i will get to experience deseo again . four
3 i have been to two shows so far and ca n't wait to go back ! the service is fast and friendly and the lay out of the club is great , not a bad seat in the house . my only qualm would be that the seating can be
2 since the place is right in my new ` hood , i had to check it out . it seemed slow for a saturday night -- we were seated right away in a mostly empty dining room . usually a red flag for me , but times are tough .
1 unimpressed , sadly . we stopped in for a nightcap on a friday night and it was fairly busy . everyone was <unk> in front around the live music , and there were empty seats in the back and up in the balcony . we tried up there first ,
2 this <unk> is on the good side . the food is the same as always , of course . they do try to get creative with the menu but it 's <unk> <unk> on <unk> <unk> e burro territory . the service was great , which is pretty much what
4 we were really happy with our first visit to pomegranate . we went in for sunday breakfast , and were very piqued by the menu and everything else this place has to offer . it 's almost too much to take in at first -- as you glance around ,
3 i have n't eaten a meal here for a long time , so i 'm reviewing just the nightlife aspect of the place . it is divided roughly into a restaurant on one side and a <unk> music area on the other . the live bands they have in here
2 hey , a restaurant that sells food and brews their own beer . what a novel concept ! not . bj 's is a chain and they do pretty good by their patrons . i can never go to a restaurant that serves fish and chips and not order it
1 i 'm sad to say that the place has gone very much downhill since their move to a bigger location . i 've given them a few chances hoping it was just growing pains , but it 's taken way too long to get back on their game . i
3 a couple of things stuck out to me for this place . one was the really clean and refreshing ambience they 've got going on . the other thing that stuck out was the <unk> , yet <unk> of the food . i had a turkey and egg sandwich ,
4 <unk> ? i ca n't believe i have n't reviewed this place yet . it is by far , one of my favorite taco shops in all of phoenix . authentic . quality . delicious . when you first come in you get chips and can start experiencing the amazing
3 this place is great . it is almost always a must to stop here when i 'm at tempe marketplace . their tea is top quality , they have a very knowledgeable staff and an amazing array of tea flavors . sometimes if i do n't know what i want
2 i 've heard so many good things about this place . it seemed like it may be a favorite phoenix lunch joint for cuisine <unk> and it looks like it is for some , but was only a-ok to me . there was nothing gross or disgusting to me about
1 i never wanted to find myself on thomas rd. saying `` i 'd like 3 fingers '' , but that 's how my night at cane 's began ... over all , i can say my 3 finger experience was n't as fulfilling as i 'd hoped . for being
3 this is a great lunch place , i go here frequently . the food is always good , and as long as you go at lunch , you do n't have to pay tip ! my favorite order is the spartan club and the pesto fries , yum ! the
3 say what you will about this place , but overall , i dig it . i did n't appreciate it when i lived in scottsdale , but as i have moved farther and farther away , i find myself wanting to go here more and more . there are many
2 i 've been to stand up live twice in the past month , first for the <unk> brothers and then this past weekend for stephen <unk> . both were great shows and it seems like stand up live is getting many more big acts . i 'll definitely return to
4 this is by far the best sports bar food i 've ever had . here 's what i highly recommend : - cheeseburgers : however you want it , they are excellent . - the monaco : one of the most popular items on the menu -lrb- just know though
3 had a new years eve dinner with my girlfriend last night and we had an excellent dinner . started off with the <unk> cake and it was very delicious , definitely would get again . for the main course i had the filet mignon which was delicious as well ,
0 should n't the food you name your restaurant after actually taste good ? why people go here for wings instead if zipps or half moon is beyond me . only good thing about this place is that they have all the games on tv . otherwise , food sucks .
2 su vino is the `` first and only winery in scottsdale . '' i like to come by every once in a while to sample some of their wines . they often have a $ 15 deal on groupon and whenever i see it i 'll buy one or two
3 best house margarita in phoenix . their ingredients are standard , but something makes them tangy and i ca n't figure it out to duplicate at home . keeps me coming back i guess . we 'd be back more if they offered better vegetarian selections ...
4 always great . always hip . moscow mule is my favorite drink and my girl likes the caramel apple martini -- always served to the brim . hell 's fire chips are fantastic too , with extra az <unk> sauce .
3 as mayor on <unk> , i 'm obligated to review this place . favorite is the veggie <unk> burrito . i add pico and green salsa and salt to the inside though , as i think they 're salsas are bland .
2 meh . while they serve a decent house margarita , their service is spotty and the food , kind of bland . i 'll recommend it as a good place to go to meet someone at the <unk> bar for chips , salsa and margaritas . that 's it .
3 rei has a fantastic selection of everything under the sun for you outdoor needs . their prices are higher than big box chains but what i like about rei is the fact that their staff is extremely knowledgeable . i 'm willing to pay a little extra to know i
2 the plates are all very tasty but my god , the servings are so small ! the first time i ordered two soft tacos with rice and beans . it was about $ 9 . i finished my meal in about 3 minutes and was still hungry so i ordered
4 this place has a great little vibe and fantastic music . i have to admit , i 'm not very hip when it comes to the blues but i definitely enjoy listening to it when given the chance . it was a nice change to look into the crowd and
2 i 've always enjoyed rosita 's . everything is really <unk> up , a lot of it is greasy , and the 've expanded their menu within the last few years . it 's almost overwhelming how many things are on there but i especially like the fajitas and of
4 i really adore this place . they 've got some of the best lentil soup around and all of their chicken dishes have been perfectly seasoned and very , very juicy . i recently got the kabob plate and it came out so tender and juicy it was falling apart
2 i have to say , i 've had way better middle eastern food . if it was n't for the price and the fact that my significant other adores the place , i 'd probably never eat here . the service has always been good , even when packed .
4 mmmmm . let me break it down for you ... when you can hear staff in the kitchen saying `` oh wow , that looks amazing '' as plates are coming up in the window , you 're in for a treat . i mean the fact that they see
4 thanks to my friend michelle who is on a little phoenix <unk> while i 'm stuck in tucson , now all i can think about is fez ! the fez burger with fries and one of their amazing bar <unk> is my idea of a great time . add the
4 loved this place ! very hip scene - packed bar - great food ! there drinks were n't poured very heavy as the bar is managed <unk> with over head <unk> or so the waiter said ! i loved the decor ! very la ! it aint cheap ! but
0 yikes ! this place is scary ! the service was horrible although the waitress 's were cute to look at -lrb- think coyote ugly - the movie -rrb- . the food was plentiful but very average . it was just <unk> . too bad , the bull riding could have
2 nothing to complain about . the `` perfectly grilled salmon '' was actually perfectly grilled . great service . it 's just not a 4-5 star restaurant .
0 you people are f-ing nuts . this place could not be more americanized and could not taste more like cafeteria food . it looks like most reviewers gave stars for how cheap the food is . `` half off drinks ! '' wow , that helps me figure out if
2 i had a great meal here with friends from florida . they said it was not as great as florida cuban food , but then again , we 're in the desert , what do you expect ?!?! everyone agreed that the food was tasty , and it came out
3 ya know , just when i thought i could n't fit one more restaurant into my casual mexican food rotation , rubio 's comes along with its damn delicious tacos and its friendly employees and its <unk> of coke zero in its fountain drink machine and the next thing you
3 coda b. and i do n't go out for pizza very often . this is for 2 reasons . 1 . coda likes domino 's . 2 . i like , nay , love mushrooms on pizza -lrb- among other delicious vegetable toppings -rrb- while coda prefers his pizza be
4 i find my reaction to posh similar to will <unk> 's reaction to jersey boys in the <unk> overlooked 2010 feature film `` the other guys '' . it 's not great , it 's fantastic . you guys totally <unk> it ! wow , what a restaurant . actually
0 thank god it 's closed . my boyfriend once caught a guy trying to reach into my purse while i was making my way through the crowd . another guy then straight up asked him if he knew where he could get blow , as he was from out of
2 this restaurant caused my boyfriend and i to get into an argument over whether preferring your burger well-done was wrong . he claims preferences ca n't be wrong . i claim they can . examples of wrong preferences include : preferring <unk> to kittens , preferring <unk> <unk> to the
4 i went there yesterday and am going back again today . the carne asada , the guac , the beans , the salsa . it 's all just perfect . it made my freaking day yesterday and let me tell you i had an awesome day yesterday . if you
3 i do n't think i could ever give five stars to a restaurant that has a $ <unk> entree and is located across from an h & m in a shopping mall , but modern steak got pretty close . for one thing , their retail therapy drink is ridiculously
2 this place was pretty good . good food for the money - but it was definitely not one of my favorites . the atmosphere is only so-so too . you must make sure to get dressed up before coming here , which i do n't mind , but i also
3 liked the food here ! the staff was very friendly too . we shared the ahi tuna salad and a burger , and both were great ! probably wo n't go out of our way to go here , but it was definitely a nice meal . : - -rrb-
2 always a fun place to go to for a pizza cookie , salad , pizza , etc. . friendly service too .
4 we are in love with this place !!! we even took family here when they came from out of town . we are big produce <unk> -lrb- do n't buy much processed foods -rrb- , and this place has amazing prices and quality of produce . if you are a
2 it 's good , but it 's not great .
3 i have always enjoyed benihana ! the food is very good for the price you pay , and i just love how i am able to eat a bit of everything while i 'm there . we have had some great chefs too . the only thing is that some
3 this place reminded us of our trip to ireland recently ! the atmosphere -lrb- minus the big screen tvs -rrb- was very much like irish <unk> . the food was very good as well , and the service was very quick . we 'd definitely return !
3 good food and fast service . the prices were good too ! i love orzo ! : -rrb-
4 very strenuous hike at times , but that gives you that sense of accomplishment ! it 's so cool to make it all the way to the top and look down on the whole city . beautiful views !
2 we liked crush lounge better than christopher 's . i guess that means we liked the smaller plates and appetizers better than the entrees . and it 's a little pricey if you just kind of like the food . probably not going to return .
3 very good food ! we ate some shrimp tacos and macaroni and cheese . they split our tacos up for us and did n't charge for it ... the portions were great too ! our server was friendly as well . would definitely return !
3 love the raised garden as you walk into this place . it 's so wonderful to see the food you will be eating ! everything looked so great . we had the make your own pizza <unk> and grilled veggies . pretty good ! very good for the price too
1 i 'm sorry to be the chinese californian raining down on everyone 's parade , but i grew up eating dim sum and china king does not cut it . i thought the variety was limited and the taste was meager . i. . . will not return . :
2 i thought this buffet was okay . granted , it was really bang for the buck and definitely a lot nicer than normal buffets in the phoenix area , but i did n't feel like it was that awesome . first of all , the selection was quaint , but
4 i 've been here a few times since they opened -lrb- i live next door -rrb- , and have always had amazing food , drink and service ... <unk> -lrb- que law and order theme music here -rrb- last sunday night . when <unk> -lrb- the manager -rrb- is there
3 the quarter is nice . it 's uptown scottdale . if you know what your getting into , then your good to go and you wont be disapointed . if you have no idea what i mean by `` uptown scottsdale '' , then you wont like it . it
0 everything is genetically modified food on purpose - not real sure what all the fuss is about this place . it is an average place . nothing stood out except that they purposely use genetically modified ingredients , they never use anything organic on purpose . everything you eat in
2 went here tonight based on reviews from yelp . we ordered food to go . they cook everything except the salads in some spice rub so beware if you do not like spicy food , which we do not . the grill cheese sandwich with bacon is very spicy due
1 when this please first opened it was good , but they have gone downhill since the beginning . plus there are way more better burgers places than indulge . this place the prices are too high for the food you get and the burgers are nothing to write home about
0 if you want a waitress that puts you down for complaining that the mac and cheese is cold eat here ! `` personally i would ' t eat it , it 's too hot for my taste . '' as she sets it down after they re heated the mac
4 the food was sooo good ! you can not miss out on eating at this place . there was never a dull moment . the drinks were great too !
2 i do n't get what the hype and big deal are . i do think the outdoor patio seating is quaint . i love that they give pizza dough to the kids to play with and then bake the kids creation . i found our salad to be just okay
0 totally bummed that when i ordered tofu and veggies it came out cooked in chicken broth . i 'm sure it is my fault and i should have <unk> that i was a vegetarian but i thought that was <unk> from the conversation i had with the waitress and by
3 this place is packed on a friday night ! the service is so so so slow . the food on the menu is interesting - soft pretzels with mustard and so on . my drink was good and i enjoyed the outside bar .
3 pretty good service though our waiter did forget to give us breadsticks . i like that they give you a free sampling of wine before your dinner . love the zuppa <unk> soup and the salad . the eggplant parm was just so so .
4 i am so glad that the entertainment book had a coupon for this place . a girlfriend of mine and i went for dinner and i just loved it . i can not wait to go back . we got a vegetarian sampler plate and the waiter -lrb- owner maybe
1 went for my son 's 15th birthday to enjoy lunch . sushi is his favorite . this place is small and you have to go into the restaurant next door for the restroom . the menu is fairly limited and expensive , in my opinion . the service was average
0 just got back from having lunch here ... been many times in the last year for lunch , take out , ect . we will not be back !!! went for lunch ... got my usual of kung pao tofu with white rice and veggie egg roll . my husband
1 not impressed at all . the guy working the counter and the owner lady making the frozen desserts were very nice and that is about the only positive about our experience . i tried a sample of the strawberry birthday cake gelato . yuck ! i noticed they did n't
4 my favorite pizza place . i am not a big fan of pizza yet i could eat here daily . i prefer the white pizza with tomatoe slices but i will eat any vegetarian variety , including just cheese . the eggplant sandwich is to die for and enough for
2 went for lunch with my husband . i had the tofu asian vegetable salad . it was just okay . the salad was fairly expensive - over $ 11 . it was pretty small . i was laughing about it having the word vegetable in it because it contained lettuce
2 positives : + outdoor <unk> + cheese and fruit plate + pork entree negatives : - tight trendy inside of restaurant - average salads - bad parking situation
2 i was just not that impressed with the sandwiches . i would rather buy the baguette they make there -lrb- the kids enjoy watching that -rrb- and make my own sandwiches at home .
4 just did take out . great experience . easy to place my order over the phone , friendly service . nice that they have special pick up parking spots and entrance . made it an in and out operation . ordered the gluten free pizza with pepperoni and sausage .
2 i wo n't hurry back . i did enjoy the amount of avocado they put on my veggie burger . the sweet potato fries were okay . the line was a bit long and the food a bit over priced .
2 good . not bad . not great . tastes just like a fry bread that you get at any casino or street fair , ect . i had the indian taco with beans , cheese and lettuce . my three kids split two of the tacos with ground beef ,
3 had to wait a little for a table . the first time we were seated was right by the open kitchen . it was so loud that we asked to be moved . we had to wait again for a new table . the waiter was n't overly friendly or
1 the service at this location was horrendous . was not informed that soda is not included with the meal but milk , tea and coffee are . so my son ordered a soda which was like $ 2.50 extra when he would have been happy with the free iced tea
4 when i go here i always look forward to when i can go back . i enjoy the bread bowls of soup , the sandwiches , the pasta - butternut squash and garlic lemon penne are my favorites . i also like the new flavored lemonade they have and the
3 okay , i like the fact that your meal comes with a drink -lrb- milk , coffee or tea -rrb- and salad or soup and bread and dessert . or if you want to skip the drink and dessert at lunch it is $ 1.50 off your bill . i
3 i went in with really low expectations as this is a chain restaurant and left very happy . the ambiance is higher scale then i expected and the service was very good . they offer both low cost and higher end priced meals on the menu . i went with
3 i visited this location a few months ago for the first time , and returned for my second visit the very next day . i got their standard chicken and waffle plate on my first visit , and just chicken and macaroni the next day . both visits were pleasant
3 they have good lunch specials , but your options are more limited than at dinner time . i have had the pleasure of trying almost everything on their menu , as i have been going here for years . good quality , huge portions , but the servers can make
1 we -lrb- my friends and i -rrb- really only go here on tuesday nights for their 99 cent taco tuesday special . my friends had been going here forever for this special and we decided to make it a weekly thing . this has been going on for a while
4 thai elephant is my favorite place to get thai in tempe . expect your standard thai classics with a few twists here and there . there 's also a full bar with signature cocktails , try to pomegranate martini , its amazing ! i usually go with elephant broccoli ,
3 first time visiting <unk> , and i really enjoyed it . the atmosphere and ambiance is very laid back and tropical , with tiki heads and surfer posters everywhere . clean , friendly , and an awesome drink menu ! cuisine offers a mix of seafood and island favorites with
1 had the delux with it 's arugula and <unk> mush -lrb- for the record , if you 're going to but bacon on a burger , it needs to be in crispy , <unk> form -rrb- , and i have to say i was immensely unimpressed ... flavor was lacking
3 i was really excited the first time i came here , but unfortunately my experience <unk> let 's not get into that . this go around i had the beef fried noodle with xo sauce and the fried tofu app . noodle dish was awesome ! very flavorful and not
3 if you go during the weekend , expect an hour wait . you 've got nothing to do so just sit in some of the lounge chairs out front and relax . i had the turkey omelete with <unk> cheese -lrb- on of my new favorite things -rrb- , wife
4 love !!! this place is awesome . it 's great <unk> at a decent price in a casual atmosphere . i 've never had a bad meal but the linguini in white clam sauce may very well be my favorite along side the lasagna . they have an excellent house
3 best toasted subs ... ever . i order the white <unk> and pretty much stick to that . it 's awesome . the cheesy garlic bread ... delish ! try it with pepper jack = -rrb- this place is a regular for us when we want a good sandwich .
3 the hubs and i are suckers for some good pho and we have n't found better in phoenix since we moved here . the restaurant itself is nothing special but what does one expect when you can get two bowls of pho , two drinks , and crispy spring rolls
3 love love love ! being from the bay area i am all about a nice loungy atmosphere . this spot is right up my ally ! great music , chill vibe and good drinks . it 's dimly lit and they play some good down <unk> house music . my
2 i was n't really feeling it at big bang this weekend . after wasting 24 dollars on entrance fee and subpar food at the greek fest , we walked over to big bang to check out the dueling pianos . they have quite the happy hour , where everything is
2 i do n't care a whole lot for this mall , but they have a good <unk> 's of hollywood , so that 's a plus for me . it 's pretty ghetto here , despite the fancy facade they so desperately try to put out there . they have
3 i was pleasantly surprised with this place ! kierland is really uppity in my mind , so i tend to shy away from all their dining options . too fancy schmancy for me ! however , after a long day of shopping and browsing the crazy ridiculous sur la table
3 this place really made me laugh , but mostly because of the <unk> hanging from the ceiling . he has a big happy face along with arms and legs . how cool is that ? to say this place is bustling would be a serious understatement . every single time
3 typically the husband and i do n't care for harkins theatres for a myriad of reasons , but this one seemed to be a step above all the other locations . first of all , they seemed to be well staffed , and their employees actually did their jobs well
3 i really liked this place ! walking inside to this sleek and beautifully appointed <unk> restaurant is a stark contrast to the <unk> strip mall complex that it calls home . clean white walls surround the modern chairs and deep benches with dark wood accents . i love the splash
4 this may be my new favorite spring training facility ! i 've been to every one in the cactus league except for the one in <unk> , but that 's coming soon . this park is absolutely gorgeous . everything from the rolling hills to the carefully crafted winding paths
3 i just love bbq . there are n't a whole lot of places that do bbq either , strangely enough . we 've driven by the tiny purple building a handful of times , but we 've never stopped in . a few weeks ago , we did . i
3 i am definitely going to miss this place now that we live in seattle . we seem to have a hard time finding non <unk> healthy food dining options here . aside from that , this place is really quite good . basically , everything on this menu is healthy
2 i 'm not going to really <unk> into what makes bianco 's pizza world famous , because i do n't agree . it is certainly delicious pizza , no doubt . to be honest though , you can get the same quality pizza at cibo 's in a tiny fraction
3 well , this is probably going to be my last az review for a very long time . expect a slew of seattle reviews instead . : o-rrb - taylor 's cafe was pretty awesome despite the fact that we had a little trouble finding it . it sure is
3 i 've had this place bookmarked for ages now and finally we were in the area so we went . we drove around the stupid little shopping area forever just trying to find the restaurant until we discovered that the address is slightly misleading . in case this happens to
1 <unk> ... i had always wanted to try this spot , and living within walking distance for the past 3 years has n't done much to change that , until now . after catching a show at the herberger , ashley a. suggested we go here for <unk> . i
3 i think that this is one of the better malls in the valley . i find the store selection to be above average , and unlike many other malls it has tenants in pretty much every space . lots of other malls around the valley are starting to look like
1 bleh . i do not like this location at all ! i normally do n't have anything bad to say about amc theatres , but this one just makes me mad . first of all , the bathrooms are terrible ! they are way too small and somehow manage to
2 eh , this place is alright . we wanted to try something new this weekend and we happened to drive by so we gave texaz grill a shot . i of course yelped it first to decide what i was going to eat , and the response was overwhelmingly to
2 much much better ! the first time i went into smeeks , saying i was disappointed was really an understatement . i already love frances , so of course i would love smeeks too ! unfortunately , my first visit did n't confirm that , but my second one almost
3 went here for lunch with a co-worker . great place for a fast bento box . the food was fresh and the server was very pleasant . i had the teryaki chicken bento box with vegetable tempura which comes with miso soup , salad , cucumber salad and rice .
4 i chose this restaurant based on yelp reviews and also because it was a choice on arizona restaurant week . arrived with a group of 4 people and a baby . 3 of us ordered off the restaurant week menu . i chose the shrimp appetizer -lrb- pan roasted gulf
3 went with some friends for the first time and we all shared our dishes . everything was very tasty - i really enjoyed everything . i will go back here often .
3 i fell in love with this place a few weeks ago when my friend and i decided to try it on a whim . -lrb- by friend , i mean fellow foodie -rrb- . i love that los reyes is n't your typical mexican place . not that i do
2 the food here is good , but not stellar . i 've tried a number of their dishes and i will continue to go because it 's nearby when i need my fix for gyros . i like their salads , although ask for the dressing on the side or
4 this place has answered my prayers . just when i thought i could n't find a really good , inexpensive middle eastern place , my friend brought me here . 1 . really good , really fresh pita bread 2 . awesome salad , very fresh and tasty . 3
3 <unk> that i am , i am always looking for a good traditional pizza and a philly cheesesteak . 5 stars for the pizza here - just like i used to have growing up . 3 stars for the cheesesteaks -- good but not great , and a bit overpriced
4 if you know what you want and you 're prepared , fogo de chao is 5 stars . practically starved myself all day so i could indulge . father-in-law and i were greeted warmly by the hostess . stopped in the bar for a drink and had a nice glass
4 i love everything chef jose garces touches . have been here 3 times , and every time has been a little different , but always excellent . went for a menu tasting with a magazine writer who was doing a feature , so we got to try lots of dishes
3 5 star pancakes , 3 star service and facilities . the pancakes are perfect . super light and fluffy . a `` short stack '' -lrb- two big pancakes -rrb- is perfect for a normal human being . service is just so-so -- nice enough , but <unk> . and
4 great pizza , wonderful beers , super service . what 's not to like . stopped in for a mid-afternoon lunch with wifey . arrived before she did and scanned the menu for microbrews . settled on a green flash ipa and ordered a pint . server said , ``
4 i am a huge `` foodie '' , from a long line of `` foodies '' . i grew up living in hotels and on room service and fine dining . this is the best , very best , breakfast restaurant ever ! i have been living in tempe for
2 honey bears offers a different type of bbq sauce , it 's the <unk> kind that also packs more of a kick . i personally prefer a thicker sauce but this one is still tasty . they keep some warm out in the open for you to help yourself which
2 good consistent bbq . the portions are hefty and the prices seem reasonable . i really like that they have so many sauces to choose from and that they have paper towels at the tables . not much more to say , i mean , it 's a chain but
4 wow - started eating meat again and have been back 4 times already . the french dip is awesome sauce - i prefer to dip mine myself so i order it dry and they give you a lot of au jus on the side . falls apart there 's so
4 selection . so many frozen yogurt flavors and toppings . by the way , this is yummy frozen yogurt , not the frozen yogurt that literally tastes like they took some <unk> and <unk> it . my personal favorite is the coconut flavor ... it 's nice and light and
4 tried toyama for the first time this weekend . after hearing many good things about it , decided it was finally time to try it . sat at the sushi bar with <unk> ... who was awesome , friendly , and always willing to offer his suggestions on what was
4 soooo good ! i 'm so sad that this is the only lee 's in the valley and that i live far away from it ... i would go all the time otherwise . i had the # 5 grilled pork sandwich , and it was so satisfying , and
4 love the phx zoo !! all the animals were out and about and looked good . the weather was cooler in <unk> . staff was friendly . kudos to <unk> on twitter for getting us out and reminding us to go !
4 went for lunch and got right in ! the service was amazing and very friendly . i had the ceasar salad -lrb- which was the best ceasar salad i have ever had in my life -rrb- also ordered the chicken parmesan -lrb- lunch portion - not the normal huge one
3 i really do enjoy famous daves . we usually get the family of 4 deal and that offers almost every single meat they offer . something for everyone . the service is good , the food is good and everyone is happy !
4 jam packed well after lunch hours . full of mostly locals - hawaiian locals that is . -lrb- that right there should tell you something . -rrb- i have not had island food this good since i left the islands . i am serious - there is a place in
2 i really wanted to like this place more because of the nice beer selection they have . downside is that it has kind of a low life neighborhood sports bar type of atmosphere inside . food choices were heavily <unk> on grease also . not that healthy and the bartender
2 i am not much of a sushi fan usually but i thought this place was pretty good . i was really happy that they had more than the typical sapporo , <unk> , kirin beers that you find at every sushi place but had a small number of american microbrew
1 when we got there the place was crowded so we decided to go out on the patio . alright , who <unk> a lot of money on a patio and does n't install lights ? service was super slow outside and because we could n't read the menus we made
3 pretty darn good burger and sides . still not as good as in n out but few places are . love the sweet potato fries and chocolate malt . i wish they had more options as to fixings but it was still ok and i will go back .
1 a cool coffee shop with beer , what could be better ? well how about serving beer past 10:00 on a saturday ? totally stupid operating hours for the bar . reminds me of of more like a dorm room than a place to go hang out in .
2 updated to 3 stars simply based off the great response i got from the founder of the company in response to my yelp review .
3 the gelato is top notch . really great flavors . maybe i just had bad luck with the server but she did n't know how to make a malt , she even said that she thought a malt and a shake were the same thing and i had to tell
1 i was really looking forward to eating here . tucked away in a strip mall behind a denny 's . nice patio area facing a parking lot . the choices for the burgers were really good . the sauce that came with the sweet potato fries was good . our
3 while slightly overpriced on many items such as yogurt , milk and produce , the deli sandwich prices ca n't be beat . the store is always clean and the food always appears fresh .
3 love this place , major problem is that there is always a wait on the weekend and no reservations . my other knock is that they have some crazy <unk> some items are certainly reasonable such as a side pork chop for $ <unk> how can you justify $ 4.00
3 if you are looking for an old fashioned ice cream parlor this is the spot . the food is also old school diner type food , the meatloaf is pretty good , but it is meatloaf after all , not a porterhouse steak . the desserts are rich and the
4 i have been stalking st. francis for months . let me explain , i drive by every day on the way home from work , and i ca n't help taking my eyes off the road to check out this <unk> restaurant . i began <unk> sean m. to accompany
3 my <unk> and i returned to pullano 's because we wanted to pregame night class -lrb- completely necessary -rrb- . our experience was much better this time around . we were under considerable time <unk> and our waitress was more than accommodating . she let us order four drinks at
3 i 'm not sure why asu has n't started using this place for research yet . <unk> could study human <unk> patterns in the shoe section . <unk> could study class <unk> between the <unk> buying 15 designer handbags and the college girls buying 6 $ 1.00 tank tops .
2 pullano 's is a dirty little sports bar located in a run down strip mall . but , remember , looks can be deceiving . the pizza and wings are some of the best on the westside as well as some of the cheapest . but what really matters is
2 fresh and easy makes for an interesting study in <unk> . when i am at home in san diego , i do not shop fresh and easy because the location nearest to me is not on any of my regular paths . tempe fresh and easy is smack dab in
1 we got to experience macayo 's because the local italian restaurant is closed on sundays . how to express the feel ... ? not very busy on a sunday afternoon around 4 pm ... overpriced and certainly <unk> margaritas ... plenty of chips and salsa being delivered to the table
2 great brisket and smoked salmon , the fish <unk> was n't bad either and calamari was tasty but it is pick and choose . the pizza did not look good but many items were fresh . for the price of nearly $ 25 per person -lrb- incl tax -rrb- that
3 yelp deal of 50 % off was great !
3 a little bit difficult to find and an off beat menu pairing but it was good . -lrb- note : despite the yelp map showing it on the e side of central , lo-lo 's is actually west of central two doors on the north side of <unk> -rrb- .
3 free tasting of <unk> tequila at the entrance . thanks for the introduction , it was pretty smooth . btw , does anyone recall the song <unk> ? the name is too close - lol !
4 love love love this mall ! it has everything !
3 good eats , good service .
4 i love the workers at this location . always friendly and helpful !!! pita jungle is delish !
4 great fast food place !! the prices ca n't be beat and their food is excellent compared to other fast food places . i love the `` <unk> '' burger -lrb- aka , grilled cheese and topping burger -rrb- . also , love the secret menu online !
4 awesome desserts ! never tried the food ! why waste the room ? life 's short , eat dessert first !
4 great pizza , good pastas !
4 great out door seating !
4 one of my favorite restaurants in the valley ! they have the best happy hour location and best burger . great decor and excellent waitstaff !
4 need to update my review : i went back to distrito twice this week . once , while attending the taste of scottsdale food tour . i was impressed this time around ! on the food tour we had guac and chips . both were home made and delish !
3 a patio that does n't just make you look at cars ! that 's the first thing you 'll notice when you get here . on a weekend you can wait about 45 minutes , but just get a designer margarita and enjoy the view and the action . fyi
3 they 're smart about their wine list and serve a good cocktail . i think that 's a great place to start . i 've been here several times and the last time was when they offered a <unk> menu with justin wine pairings . they created a great atmosphere
4 this is as good as it gets . the sensory and educational exhibits are well organized and thought out . i suggest going to the web site to check out value packs and group rates for admission . as of june 08 , food selection is only snacks -lrb- chips
4 my grandma lives like 3 blocks away and i had no idea man vs. food had been here i know a lot of places are way too hyped up to be on the show but this one makes perfect sense . i was extremely shockingly surprised . i did not
3 the french toast on my sandwich for lunch was absolutely delicious ! however , i can not say i am a fan of the monte cristo . french toast to me needs to be seperate from eggs . i love me some good french toast . i figured id give
2 meh ... i wanted to love this place . seriously . especially with the awesome foursquare and yelp check in they offer . just so you are n't as surprised as i was when i got to the register with the check in : you must buy a sandwich and
1 talk about an attitude ! the server whom i did n't catch a name from since she stood at our table for a <unk> and disappeared every time asking us but not giving us a chance to talk if we did or did not want something . i am glad
0 i did n't see one attractive hooters girl here with `` hooters '' just sayin ...
4 this place is absolutely awesome ! i loved the pretzel bread and the pizza , can not wait to try more of the other pizzas . the beer queso was terrific with the pretzel bread and pizza crust . : -rrb-
4 this is one of my favorite breakfast places of all time . the strawberry cheesecake french toast is my favorite along with the berry pancakes or french toast both are good . i tried the corned beef hash skillet and it was okay . the waiter is hit or miss
4 once again i have found an all time favorite dish at this fine establishment . the house chicken ! if you do not like mushrooms what so ever or do not care for spicy food i do not think this will appeal to you . oh my god it is
2 i have never had hand pulled noodles before so i ordered it in both the beef stew soup i ordered which was okay . also in the fried chicken noodles i had ordered . the noodles were tasty but i suggest cutting them a bit so its a little easier
3 i like chase , i liked it better as bob but that is because bob just sounds cool . you have to admire a place that can cool the air from 110 to a nice 75 degrees . the building is cool , nothing special to me . <unk> seems
3 rock springs was our first stop on the guys only annual xmas shopping extravaganza . except this year this is no shopping . we stopped in to get breakfast before the big drive to <unk> and crown king . the place was busy but able to get a seat right
3 so apparently on sundays they run single trains ... lame it was so freaking packed you either sat next to the sleeping man or stood with you ass in the face of the old man . there were more bikes then i have ever seen before . we still had
2 it is a really cool place . good pizza but nothing crazy . great for a quick lunch . just watch out they only take debit if it is over $ 5 . the lunch special is not over $ 5 . duh ... raise the price to $ 5
4 we tried a new dish on our sunday ritual . it was the caramel chicken , as they said in the ad . `` subtle sweetness of caramel with a hint of chile and fresh pineapple . the dish is topped with a fresh asian slaw of cucumber , red
1 not a huge fan ... the service was ok , nothing special nothing bad . the building was ok , a little dirty . the pizza was a disappointment . the crust is good but really did n't have much flavor , the sauce . . oh wait what sauce
2 solid 3.5 this place is brand new . it is a market and a great place for lunch . my review is for lunch only . gyro $ 5.99 fry 's and drink $ 2.50 total $ <unk> the place is clean and has plenty of help . everyone is
4 ruben on a sub roll toasted with <unk> on this side put my rating to 5 stars ! damn that was good . the kids loved the place too . they want more !
3 sunday seems to be pei wei day in my house . i usually go pick it up and bring it home . i like to watch them make the food , so i sit at the little bar area . man they can cook . michael the manager is really
3 3.75 ftr i am not a fan of flat fried burgers , i prefer grilled over a flame . man i love the taste of a fire <unk> hunk of ground beef . i read a few reviews and thought i should at least try the burger . i am
3 so i visited this place two times over this weekend ... sounds bad right ? friday we shared a pizza and wings , 3 <unk> and cokes for me and several large mugs of beer for my sexy wife . everything was great and the bill was cheap . we
4 so it has been a little over a year since i was here last . the place still holds a 5 star review from me . i tried the <unk> and it was good . i never really cares for <unk> but figured if i was going to like it
4 as good as it gets ... if you want good food , great decor and fast service . do not go looking for a romantic dinner or a fancy meal . i had the lunch bbq pork with `` texas frys '' and a dr pepper the pork was excellent
3 i will make this short and simple . i am a huge <unk> pizza fan . i like everything about <unk> . the crust , sauce , cheese etc. . mm is like a rays style but with <unk> flavor . i really liked mm . the sauce is more
3 i 'm a big fan of local craft beer and i 'm happy to live within walking distance of this little place . most of their beers are alright , but they have some serious winners on deck if you enjoy hoppy ales . their seasonal selection is also almost
4 go . to . fnb . i just recently had my anniversary dinner at fnb with my girlfriend and it was truly a phenomenal experience . char , pavle and emily deserve every pleasant thing that i 've heard about them , and they certainly deserve every single star in
4 hold the phone ! how have i not known about sweet republic until now ?! this place is top notch when it comes to sweet treats ! i pretty much sampled every ice cream when i dropped by here and every flavor was unique ! i mean c'mon ... <unk>
3 i completely have to thank yelp for this one . i work around the scottsdale airpark and i did n't even know this place existed until i did a little yelping . the food is definitely on point with what the other reviews are saying , and i was very

4 same great happy hour and food as the central location . i did not note a difference in the food between both locations . arcadia has a nice outdoor patio , i prefer the tables that sit halfway outside and halfway inside . see if you can get one when
3 live music , plenty of beer on tap , and a very happening place . this place was packed with people however with a group of 6 we still found tables and chairs . i enjoyed some beers on tap , but wanted to try some food so we ordered
0 if you have nothing to really do and just want a basic lunch in a cozy environment i say go for it . i dont know what the pie is so humble about its not that great . with all the other choices for food in scottsdale i say look

2 do n't be fooled by the 3 star rating . as much as i do like this restaurant . i can just think of a lot of others that i would choose before coming here again . food was good , service good and there were pretty people everywhere .
3 i come to this place for the beer selection alone !!
4 let me just start by <unk> the food is good , not great but good . but why i love this place is cause of the tv 's and the atmosphere ! i mean i can go and watch anything from football to bikini contests from soccer to water polo
3 really good pizza , wings and wine . lots of tv 's for your viewing pleasure and a real neat outside seating area to enjoy the spring weather .
4 i sure hope my trainer bill <unk> at basic training does n't follow my reviews ! i know i should n't be eating bundt cakes but i do n't care ! these cakes are so moist and scrumptious there is nothing like them ! i recently had the blueberry one
4 i 've been on a real bender lately ... and this fried chicken was worth it ! ... i got the betty boop which is a huge fried chicken breast with a super fresh and tasty waffle ... the chicken was juicy , moist and perfectly fried ! i smothered
4 best take out or eat in sushi ! josh and jesus ' make the most amazing , freshest and fastest to order sushi around ! the sushi is well priced for the volume . they have everything you would want to order available . we love the spicy tuna rolls
4 like the quaint atmosphere really cute ! out door seating that is nice during the cooler times of year . i eat here often and everything is a hit ! if you just want some tacos theirs are an a plus ... the meat juicy and tender in the chicken
3 great thai food in phoenix . have tried a couple of the thai restaurant around phoenix , so far none of them hit my taste bud . this one does a job well . if you like thai food . this one will be the one to try .
3 love this place . do n't expect great service , since they only have 1 person doing most of the things . taking order , clean the table , bring food to the table , fill the water and <unk> . but so far , their food has been consistently

4 favorite place in phoenix . i am not a huge pizza fan and for me its not the pizza that makes this place . now the burrata cheese appetizer and chocolate dessert are what do it for me . the burrata is amazing ! we normally do n't get appetizers
3 this place is great - another staple to downtown phoenix . so hoping it sticks around and does not end up going under due to its off the beaten path location . this place is pretty much anything you want it to be ... boxing - check swing -lrb- dancing
4 it took a lot of convincing , but we were able to talk the whole <unk> team into going here for dinner one night during the tournament . they complained up a storm about how it was 20 minutes away from where we were staying and some said they just

3 i have mixed feelings on this one ... and i will surely tell you why . 1 . parking was easy an hour before the game . we came off indian bend , turned into <unk> blvd , paid our $ 5 and were parked in under 5 minutes .

0 server was rude and unfriendly . place was n't very clean either . do n't go expecting them to be accommodating at all if you request their items to be made differently than as stated on menu . very disappointed
4 gilbert just got the kind of place that will make their whole downtown area that much nicer . this is a destination spot , and it does n't disappoint . amazing selection of wines . bruschetta that makes your mouth water . the atmosphere is super comfortable and relaxing .

0 okay , i 'm not one to usually flame places , but they deserve it !! i had about the worst experience ever at shogun , and i did n't even get a chance to try their food ! went a few saturdays back for lunch with a friend .
2 king gyros was decent , though everything seemed a bit on the oily side . had a gyro with good tzatziki , hummus which was okay , and onion rings : -rrb- i suppose it 's all about expectations , being a chicago gal i will fully admit a high
2 i was excited to try good fellas based on the great reviews . first , the positives : the staff was very friendly and the interior of the restaurant is a lot nicer than the facade would imply . a couple of patrons were taking a bunch of menus so
4 i ca n't believe i 've not written a review for hobe before this . super helpful staff and products that set this shop apart . of note is an amazing selection of game meats , you 'd be hard pressed to find this diverse array anywhere else in the
3 like other yelpers i recall seeing this place on triple d and wanted to try but i am a north phoenix resident who never makes it to the tuke . good thing they took over the old san gabriel or whatever the hell it was before . i enjoyed the
3 yum ! this place has great burgers and the sweet potato fries are excellent . they have all kinds of organic options which is awesome and it has a nice little outside area that is great for families and good people watching . it 's in a fairly secluded and
2 rock bottom seems to be hit , or miss . they have a pretty decent menu with a variety of items . their happy hours is sort of ho-hum for me . there 's not really a lot of good deals to be had , but beers are relatively well
3 have driven past this little diner for the longest time , and finally my friend convinced me to try it for breakfast . she had the vegetarian omelet and i had the chorizo omelet . both were very tasty and the potatoes that come with it are cooked to perfection
3 went to aiello 's for my b-day and really enjoyed the food and service . everyone was extremely nice and we even got to play their `` bingo '' game for a free dinner -lrb- we did n't win -rrb- . i had the breaded chicken with marinara sauce which
2 i have been here 2 times in the last few weeks ... 1st time it was very good ... 2nd time i think i caught the end of breakfast and got some heat lamp food ... i think 3 stars is a happy medium
1 i have only been here once so this review is simply based on a one lunch stand . i ordered the vegetable sandwich and they did not have the roasted red peppers or the grilled eggplant so these two things were automatically substituted with mushrooms and tomatoes ? the guy
3 you know , i normally love this place if i get the right food . i am picky , though . it is very hit or miss . the corn is my favorite thing - i <unk> love roasted corn . the queso chicharron thing sucks . most of the
4 urban beans is my neighborhood coffee shop . i could walk here , if i wished . i am a beverage snob , and definite foodie . i had n't had their food until recently , so i did n't feel i could have written an adequate review . ;
2 i love their hummus , but the fattoush itself left my teeth hurting for days ! i could n't bite down on much after that . this last time i went , i had the falafel and spinach pocket . i do n't know what it is about their phyllo
3 good pizza , really cool atmosphere , and make sure you save room for dessert , because the crepes are awesome ! it 's also a really great place for a date . the pizzas and salads almost seem <unk> for two-person sharing , and the atmosphere -lrb- despite the
3 perfect place for a casual lunch or a quick dinner after a day of shopping . it 's nothing special , but it 's comfortable , tasty and affordable . <unk> , high quality pizza and salads ... plus the lasagna is pretty good too .
3 just about everything you can ask for in a lunch place : tasty , efficient , healthy and reasonably priced . a little expensive , but reasonable . i really like this place . almost everything i 've ever had on the menu is good , including the often overlooked
3 i 'll give this one a four for atmosphere and beer ... and steve the manager . he rocks . the food - eh . i do n't go for the food . so last 4th of july , we were having a <unk> . hubski went to pick up
4 hot pot ! last time i went to fresh mint , i ordered the hot pot , my new favorite . i tried a few other things on the menu since my first visit , all were delicious , but nothing was as good as the hot pot . we
4 it seems to me that this is one of those ideas that i should have had ... but i did n't . opening a popsicle shop in phoenix ? hello ? paleta 's betty offers high quality popsicles and ice cream bars in flavors that i would not have dreamed
4 i love coming here with coworkers for happy hour . the bruschetta is amazing in all flavors and very vegetarian friendly . the wine and beer selection is substantial - there is something for everyone 's <unk> . the veggie sandwich is full of mushrooms , so if you 're
3 `` i would give the location 5 stars and the restaurant 3 , so we 're at 4 stars overall . i went with hubski and a couple of friends for a nice weekend picnic . the experience would have been a 5-star one if we had <unk> it ,
3 very good experience ... good food , good service . menu is a little limited and the prices high . nice ambiance and very busy at lunch time . overall , we liked it and may return . i had the pear and gorgonzola flatbread that tasted excellent , but
2 good service , very good crust , nice cheese . a little expensive for what you get , especially drinks . $ 5 for a draft beer is too much and the toppings on the pizza can add up really fast . this was our second time back and it
4 always good ! we love this place . try the sweet potato ravioli . wonderful italian wines . the lemoncello dessert is marvelous . service is great . we also like the ambiance ... cozy , quiet music that matches the cuisine . i hate going to an italian restaurant
1 good food but sad service . stopped here for lunch today before the opera . i ca n't fault the server but it took us 40 minutes to get served . they need more cooks or something . what would have been a special afternoon turned out to us having
1 mediocre food and decent service . i will note , the pecan pie is excellent . the fiance and i just came from crudo - crudo was a `` 1 out of 5 star '' type of place and we were looking to salvage the night by coming to beckett
1 i have been here on three separate occasions . first , my fiance had some friends that came to visit here , the second time was dinner with a friend and the last time was a company event . i never left this place impressed and for the dollar ,
2 i have been here on a few occasions with my fiance and while i enjoy maizie 's , it always seems like she gets raw end of the deal . it is a decent place for brunch , but outside of that , i think maizie 's really struggles finding
2 i like pita jungle just like anyone else , but i think it is given too much cred . the fake mediterranean stuff like the lavosh pizza are good , but i ca n't really say that anything else is anything but adequate . falafel is ok there . the
4 i am a die-hard grimaldi 's fan . this scottsdale location is the best one hands down . it 's neapolitan style pizza , cooked in a coal fired oven , with fresh mozzarella sliced on it . i 've always been satisfied when i 've went here . the
4 the lost leaf is tits . the music offered there is of the freshest and best quality within the phoenix music scene . they have a great beer selection and the hang is superb . one of the hippest most <unk> places in the city . the staff are cool
2 i want to hate on this place because asu is covered in <unk> , but that is n't the cue club 's fault and for business <unk> , they are making a killing . the place has really nice tables , good <unk> , which is a <unk> in the
4 oh hell yes ! now this is what i 'm talking about baby ! freshly prepared pastas , delicious inventive salads , and fancy pizza i actually like ?? i must be dreaming as this simply can not be phoenix . in the business of full disclosure , i 'm
2 this place is fine . average . nothing spectacular . but not remotely authentic either , like most of sam fox 's restaurants . they 're all absolutely satisfactory , but if you are looking to be blown away by flavorful and inventive dishes , go somewhere else , cuz
3 41/2 stars ! oh defalco 's . you drain my bank account and you take up my entire lunch hour just driving to and from but i do n't care , because you are delicious . by far the best authentic italian deli in the valley , i have yet
3 cheap food , cheaper beer , damn fine wings and curly fries . do n't come to 16th street expecting some swanky lounge with big leather booths . this is your classic <unk> bar that does n't pretend to be anything else , and thank god for that . new
4 totally just made a believer out of me . woke up this morning with a flat , which naturally put me in the world 's worst mood all day . schedule an appt online -lrb- very nifty feature by the way , -rrb- only to arrive here hours later ,
2 alright , i am going to try and cut hanny 's a little bit of slack here . went there last nite with a bunch of fabulous phoenix yelpers on the light rail pub crawl , and it was in a word , okay . i know there were a
3 the dishes always come out quick and they are always prepared well . dishes can easily be adjusted to your liking as well . never like hunting for tables during busy lunch times , but that happens at just about any good lunch spot , so no real complaint .
4 huge menu with lots and lots of choices that you normally do see anywhere else . sandwiches and sliders are amazing ! one of my fav places .
2 lots a huge tvs are always welcomed .

4 awesome donuts ! glazed donut holes are great
4 very good udon noodles
4 truely one of the best places to eat and celebrate a special occasion
4 can not go wrong on anything you order here from salads to pasta to sandwiches and pizzas . the panini sandwiches are healthy , light , tasty . the salads are full of fruit and freshly prepared . the salmon comes with a huge side of veggies that are well
2 very reasonable burger and fresh ingredients . ate at a different location before and was not to impressed . this location was much better . not gourmet burger level but better to compare with in n out and 5 guys
4 jewish sliders and all the breakfast are great
2 really sweet place to kick off your morning ! the chorizo is awesome ... for $ 5 dollars upcharge for a side of chorizo i expected more , the service was a little slow considering there are only 12 tables and about 4-5 servers . the kitchen looks a bit
4 great pizza the only pizzeria in scottsdale as far as i am concerned ... i am from italy actually napoli , italy where pizza got it 's name . the pizza at pomo is by far the best pizzeria in az ... unlike the competition the ingredients here are the
4 i am always looking for an authentic mexican cuisine experience and this place is up there with the best . some of the best salsas i 've ever had , the <unk> chile salsa is amazing if you like a little heat in your life .

1 my # 1 gripe with this place is the prices they charge . $ 10 for your run of the mill sandwich - no side dishes or drinks or anything . how many meal deals could i get at subway for 10 bucks ?! because they do n't taste much
3 this place is absolutely stunning ! the design of this building is beautiful . st. francis had been the <unk> of my favorite atmosphere - but , i think hillstone just <unk> it ! it is very open and modern with a mid-century vibe to it . love it !
0 really people ? maybe the meat dishes here are good . that 's the only way i can understand why this place has such a large customer base . initially , i was excited to see a vegetarian section on their menu with about 6 items on it . we

3 i have always thought of cibo as a perfectly fine establishment - but it is the bunch they serve on weekends that really won me over ! their brunch menu <unk> of many egg -lrb- frittata -rrb- dishes , some crepes , and a few <unk> sandwiches . every item
1 i went here for lunch , there was n't much to choose from -lrb- very small lunch menu -rrb- and when we did get a salad and sandwich -lrb- 30 min later -rrb- to share , both of us were very disappointed with the amount of food that we received
3 love the food !
1 oh for the love of god this place is boring . pottery and pictures of pottery . i came here for some tour a few years ago . i was so bored i went outside and took a nap next to giant flower pot . then i came back here
3 i 'm into this place . i 've only been here a few times but it is quickly becoming a regular hangout . the best part is the porch , but it will be too hot to enjoy that soon . so boo for that . good stuff : lots

1 i had heard good things about lo <unk> , had heard that they were voted `` best italian restaurant in scottsdale '' and when i walked in and saw the old italian couple walk out from the kitchen i thought i was in luck ! wrong . the food was
1 food is average , not at all a value for the price . my steak had almost no flavor . service was average . the waitress was n't as friendly as her cowboy hat and boots led me to believe she 'd be , nor was she very attentive .

2 the atmosphere is nice and the tvs with sports on everywhere is a bonus . the food was good . i would recommend the nachos as a starter . the burgers were good but not the best i 've ever had . the server was friendly , but scarce .
3 forefathers is great . it 's the best cheesesteak i 've had in arizona so far . i have n't tried many but best so far . the small sized one should be filling enough for most people . the fries are very tasty . it was a reasonable price
3 the owner of the store made the situation right by <unk> me . i wish more owners would realize this is a good way to make things right and keep customers who had a bad experience .
2 it was nice to sit outside in the spring time . it 's pretty quaint . the chips and salsa were good . the food was decent . the burrito was good and was big .

4 my husband and i would live here if we could ! ... the yogurt is a delicious treat that easily beats any ice-cream . it is also great fun to self serve and it is nice to have low fat options . the staff are friendly and the store is
4 this place was truly busy the other day and we were lucky to get a table . guess they are doing very well and so they should . this is definitely one of the better quick lunch spots you will find . to update the spinach salad is very good
3 buttered buns ! need i say more ? yeah sure , why not . the regular dogs are a good size but if that 's not enough for you , they offer a `` pounder '' ! yikes , not for this gal , but maybe for you . the

2 this place and menu has so much potential but i seem to make the wrong choices . it 's a big hotel restaurant with very good service . ask for lemon with water , why they do n't already know that their water tastes like <unk> is beyond me .
4 quality !!! <unk> !!! awesomeness !!!! this place needs to get closer to civilization . not that there is n't any in queen creek , but come on , they have more cows than stop lights . despite it being <unk> out of the way , for me at least
3 i have been to the parlor twice and one time it was so/so and the other it was one of the best pizza experiences i have had . talking to others it seems like they have had similar hit and miss experiences there . that being said i will always
4 this was the first restaurant i decided to go too based on my fellow yelpers , and i thank god i listened to them . you barely notice los sombreros from the road , but do n't let that fool you . this place has a great little patio with
2 another great spot for burgers ... the burgers remind me of bk or the habit burger grill , due to its pickled taste . aside from burgers , the sides are pretty good stuff . cheese curds are absolutely delicious . the fries and onion rings are great , but
3 great , creamy ice cream - never realized how good this would taste ! just about any flavor you try is worthy of a selection . i usually play it safe with some chocolate , but here i felt i could go the distance woohoo ! the fresh butter and
3 though i think their service can improve a bit , their food is delicious for sure . what have n't i tried there ? the tofu pot was still boiling when it 's served to you . the seafood pancake was crispy with loaded toppings , and the spicy octopus

4 if bar bianco was n't dominated by the presence of its immediate neighbor , with its giant international <unk> , then this bar would have the most outrageous ratings for a valley bar . it really does n't get any more quaint than bar bianco , with their converted <unk>
3 i do n't have any beef with carly 's like most downtown do , but if you do n't get to this place on the right night -- that is not too crowded on <unk> or not too sparse on most other nights -- than you certainly will have some

4 when you reach the passover from double , to triple <unk> reviews , you want the century <unk> to be something notable and worthy . where else could <unk> a 100th review than pizzeria bianco ? the secret to bianco is really quite simple : have kickass friends . what
3 this is a decent place to enjoy a couple glasses of wine and some nosh with a friend . i would give it five stars but i 'm rather turned off by the inside seating area . this place is best when you can sit outside in cool weather .
4 wings are awesome , great selection of beer on tap and tons of tvs to watch multiple games on ! friendly staff and great sports bar atmosphere !
3 i really liked this place - good atmosphere , great drinks and great service !

1 this place is just ok ... there is nothing exceptional about it ! i wanted to love it , but it really did n't give me a reason to . the menu is limited , the food is just ok , the service was friendly and nice and the atmosphere
3 i was so intrigued by this place ... alcohol and ice cream combined . i figured you could n't go wrong and boy , was i right ! the <unk> ice cream was delicious . i also tasted the strawberry <unk> rum and was totally impressed . this little gem

3 very cool place - lots of beer on draft , great band playing saturday night when we were there , and cool atmosphere !
3 nice place to enjoy happy hour and relax in a cool atmosphere . the pear martini was well made and very good . the bartender was friendly and made great drinks !
2 very nice museum and a great way to spend a few hours and escape the summer heat ! however , there is so much information in this museum that it is overwhelming ... and they plan to expand with over 20 % more information .
3 it 's been awhile since i 've been to pane bianco and i remembered tonight just how good it is . since the expansion , the new section is great ... rustic and comfortable - i absolutely love most of the pieces in there . the menu is simple but

3 great place in the roosevelt neighborhood ! the savory crepes and italian soda were delicious . excited to go back for a sweet crepe next time !
4 i love this place ! make sure matt is your bartender - such a great personality and he makes excellent recommendations ! the pernil asado tacos are quite tasty . try a side of the creamed corn too ... you will not be disappointed !
2 good place to watch sports and have a beer and a burger . nothing extremely special about this place , but good nonetheless .
3 delicious and a wonderful experience ! the owners were so engaging , thankful and kind . the food was amazing ... ham and cheese crepe and my friends and i shared a <unk> for dessert - just like i remember them in france . this place is the real deal
2 very nice place on the scottsdale waterfront ! i want to give this place the benefit of the doubt as i visited right after the spain vs. italy final soccer game today ... of course , not realizing it . the place was in utter chaos and quite a mess
2 just ok ... our salads were good and the service was acceptable . nothing spectacular about this place that makes me want to rush back .
4 i absolutely love this place ! by far the best cheesesteaks outside of philly ... hands down ! the rolls are perfectly soft , the whiz is the authentic best and the meat is just right . super friendly staff , clean restaurant ... and good pickles too !
4 ca n't afford binkley 's but decided , based on reviews here , to `` do lunch '' at caf bink - twice . if you can stay with one item from the menu , price wo n't be a concern . two items and it can get a bit
1 having now tried all three of phoenix upscale hamburger <unk> , unfortunately zinburger is my least favorite . the quality of the burger seemed fine , although for $ 10 , fine does n't seem to be enough . the regular french fries were nice and crisp . the taste
3 this little chinese restaurant is a great example of why there are almost <unk> chinese restaurants in the u. s. -lrb- chinese restaurant news -rrb- . that is more locations than mcdonald 's , burger king , wendy 's and taco bell combined ! you ca n't please everyone !
2 one of the things i became aware of after so many bowls of `` pho , '' is that i much prefer the robust flavorful broths . the broth here was delicate and almost fragrant , but not as robust as i might like . it also did n't have
3 like the thin crust pizza , esp the spicy chicken sausage . good pasta , spaghetti and meatballs . love the meatballs . kid likes the mac n cheese . can get a `` side '' dish of pasta at very reasonable price if not very hungry . good bread
4 great food , large portions , reasonable prices especially considering how much food we received . had chicken and <unk> kabobs . rice was very good with <unk> almonds and raisins . had the house salad and mediterranean salad was good also . family owned . we will be back
3 went last night for restaurant week . i had the risotto carbonara , chicken marsala and gelato for dessert . all were great . wife had the pear salad , red snapper and it was great also . server was helpful and <unk> to special requests . very attentive ,
3 pretty cool , the chips and guac was okay the filet mignon was n't the most amazing thing , and def was n't work $ 30 , but for maybe a $ 15 or $ 20 steak it would have been good . they have cotton candy that is flavored
3 this place is great , the atmosphere is swanky old school style -- if you have ever been to la and have gone to this great 30s style bar called the <unk> , or the fine dining place in seattle called 13 <unk> , this place is right on par
3 as <unk> omnivore , i sometimes like to take a break from meat and play for the other team . i have never eaten at the green original in scottsdale . this place is so close to my work that i was able try it . the first time ,
3 the first time i went here , i did n't come away feeling very satisfied mostly because i 'm cheap at times . i spent nearly $ 7 on a cookie and a `` <unk> . '' the <unk> was good but it was n't * that * good .
1 tgi friday 's . chili 's . applebee 's . cooper 's town . these <unk> bars seem to come out of the same factory . i was really hoping cooper 's town would be different food-wise . but the menu looked terribly typical of what you 'd find in
3 had to wait almost 30 minutes on a sunday morning and got only a counter seat at over easy . that 's okay , it was worth it . a friend and i split a omelet with smoked salmon , asparagus and spinach and chose home fries . the omelet
2 i have mixed feelings about this restaurant . it is owned by the cheesecake factory and there are far too many items on the menu to maintain quality control . however , i love love love and adore the new orleans beignets !!! -lrb- beignets are like the most delectable
2 my expectations were too high from all of the amazing reviews . i did find the restaurant to have a clean and comfortable feel . i have to say the cobb salad was fantastic and the carrot cake was rich and gorgeous . i found the hummus and olives to
3 what can i say - i love this place ! i was introduced to it by a group of 20 something friends so i was a bit worried going there -lrb- i 'm no longer of that age group . -rrb- turns out i had nothing to fear ! roosevelt
4 too busy to make dessert for that special at home dinner - stop by cheesecake factory and pick up some dessert to go and you will be a dessert hero ! do n't forget to try the pumpkin pecan while it is available !
3 went to this location to watch an asu game and just hang out with some friends . ordered the blackened chicken flatbread and it was great . just the right amount of spice so my nose did n't run . my favorite part was watching the more `` seasoned ''
4 lucky for me i work close to this place because i am addicted ! 3 tacos for $ 7 and they are not small , at least in my opinion . i had the chicken , chorizo , and carne asada ... i thought the chicken and chorizo was amazing
2 the dog itself was dee-lish . crispy , grilled skin and a juicy inside ... soft , steamed bun ... but i made the mistake of ordering the chili cheese dog and the chili was awful . seriously , resembled <unk> ketchup in both appearance and taste . battered ,
1 no . not even close to what a croissant should taste like . very bland . texture was all wrong -- no <unk> ! yuck . the vegetables with the egg and cheese were cold as well . my husband did n't have as bad of a reaction but we
1 like other reviewers below , i waited it out for awhile before reviewing hillside spot . my husband and i were so happy when they went in after our beloved coffee plantation left that we really wanted to give them a chance ... and now that we 've been there

3 my husband and i really enjoyed our first visit to blanco last night . service was great -lrb- he even packed us up some salsa and chips to go ! -rrb- and the ambiance is nice . we started with the crab and shrimp ceviche -lrb- big chunks of seafood
4 wonderful -lrb- <unk> ! -rrb- place for kids and adults alike . i do n't mind paying <unk> admission for this place as there is just as much to <unk> as with the child 's experience . i 'm so glad i waited to review this place until today -lrb-

4 short leash dogs is amazing , for sure . the owners could not be sweeter and more friendly , and that is the secret to their success . in addition to buying an amazing product at good value , you get to meet and become part of the extended family
3 i usually frequent the downtown lola , but fate had me in the central corridor and i gave it a shot . this lola coffee location is upscale and cozy , much like its sister location in downtown . the business is bright and airy , with a friendly crowd
3 -lrb- this review is for take-out service -rrb- most people have a ` go-to ' list of their favorite comfort food places , and emergency list that is used when you need tasty , predictable , and reliable . red devil pizza is at the top of my list for

4 holy shit is this place awesome . great unique foods , which are essentially hand held pot pies , wonderful beer selection , and desserts that will knock your socks off . this is truly a unique gem . one thing that shines <unk> is the warm , friendly service
3 i was a huge fan of their desert ridge location . i am so sad to see it 's not around anymore . my first time at the snottsdale location and i was pleased . i ordered a mango martini and it was fresh and yummy . my wife and
4 i think they are referring to the buses that pick you up and take you to the river . if that 's the case , they are wonderful . they grab your tube for you , give you tubing pointers and get 's the energy up for your long day
0 i only write reviews on yelp to help people save their money . ten bucks for a small sandwich and a drink . `` the bobbie '' which is supposed to be their signature sandwich is cold shredded turkey -lrb- maybe a 2 oz portion at most -rrb- cold stove
3 not to shabby . went on a saturday night . they had a half rack rib special with 2 sides for 12.99 . this was totally worth it . i ate every bite . ribs fell off the bone . the sauce is where it 's at . nuff said

3 adding another star since my last review . i just had their white pizza today and topped it with the tiramisu . both are highly recommended .

4 well , you know what they say - when a place is always busy , there is usually a reason . i have gone into <unk> several times and could not find a place to sit at there huge bar - why ? because the food is fantastic and everyone
3 the only place i 've been able to find deep eddy sweet tea vodka and i 'm surely going back for the wine !
4 torched goodness is a special treat ! i have seen them twice at the <unk> farmers market . creme brulee is my favorite dessert and they do it right !
4 we have a new sushi spot . probably the best sushi i 've had in 10 years . i recommend the surf n turf roll !
4 local , fresh , az treasure . next time i want a milkshake , and at least two people to share it with .
1 portillo 's in chicago is a must . portillo 's in arizona , meh . scottsdale location better than tempe location , and i only say this because you can taste that lovely tempe <unk> water taste in the food .
3 aside from our grumpy waitress who sucked at her job , everyone was friendly and helpful . the cinnamon roll was great , like a homemade <unk> . omelette and scramble pairings were very creative . the toast was weird enough that i 'd ask for an alternative next time
4 it has been about a year since our last visit and we had definitely been looking forward to it . while we enjoyed our last stay , the room we stayed in was showing its age and use . to be expected though for a hotel that seems to be
3 just made our second trip to the turf pub last night and we really like this place . it has a clean modern feel to it , yet it maintains a relaxing neighborhood aura that we really like -lrb- and wish we had in our neighborhood ! -rrb- . the
3 having been here multiple times , we are not quite sure why we have n't written a review yet . this is becoming a trusted <unk> by when we want a tasty meal , to be taken care of by great people , served solid drinks , and enjoy a
4 count us in for a # 5 combo , a oaxaca special & two hard tacos ... maybe some chips and salsa to go ! best mexican fast food around . . and cheap ! always busy at lunch , but they get through the orders in a timely manner
4 what a great place !!!! we loved it ! met friends there on a weekday night around 6pm , place was busy but they had lots of outdoor comfy seating with covers and misters . wine flight are $ 10 on thursdays . , yummy selection ! food was good
3 visited here recently on a late saturday afternoon before dinner , this is in the downtown sheraton , great location . . hotel is beautiful . . the bar was busy even for a late afternoon , nice wine list and appetizer was good ... would definitely come back !
3 enjoyed lunch here recently , was there early and by 11:45 the place was packed . food was great , especially the tortilla soup that they serve on thursdays . a bit pricey for lunch -lrb- $ 40 tab for 2 -rrb- but well worth it . they have an
2 sky harbor is a nice airport . decent staff , good layout overall i would recommend .
3 zipps is a local favorite and honestly has the best wings i have ever had . between their 32 ounce beers , medium golden honey wings and happy hour specials this is the place to be for sports events . it does get packed quickly and the tv selection is
3 after an event at the montelucia my girlfriend and i headed to old town with another couple looking for a good dinner spot . we ended up at the citizen house on their one month anniversary . the first thing was the service was great . as soon as we
4 maizie 's -lrb- note : whoever started this review thread spelled her name incorrectly -rrb- is an awesome place . very friendly , good food with ample portions , and a wonderful <unk> selection . it 's a relaxed and pleasant atmosphere - although - it can be overrun at
4 i loved stopping in to lola tapas for coffee in the morning , and since they 've moved over to central - closer to me - yay - it 's even better . i 've always liked lola coffee in one sense better than lux because it 's a calmer
3 walking distance from work , i love this place ! been there many , many times for lunch in , lunch to go , happy hour , brunch on sundays , some wine on a lazy afternoon ... and one thing this place has in common for all of those
1 good idea for a date night , but not executed well . we went in with a groupon for 2 wine tasting flights and an appetizer . we ordered a `` <unk> brownie . '' i do n't know if you have ever had these before , but they are
2 at one time i thought ticoz was a solid 4 stars , but recently it has gone downhill . whenever i go to lunch in this area every restaurant is packed , except ticoz . this should have been my first clue to stop going here . however , they
3 i love that they have a `` different '' menu . lots of unique choices - all good ! my usual go to is the chopped salad with the lox and couscous . it is definitely my favorite , but everything here is good ! try something you normally would
3 i saw a groupon for cove trattoria so i decided to give it a try . i had a salmon salad for lunch . i thought it was quite nice . the salmon was flavorful and cooked well and the salad was simple , but nice . the service was
4 this is the best sushi in town . hands down . not only is the fish is fresh , the wasabi is also fresh , and it is byob . what more could you ask for !? our favorite dish there is consistently the fresh carpaccio on special , but
3 we tried coup des tartes last weekend with the groupon they offered . we had heard it was a decent byob restaurant and figured it was worth a try . i am so happy we did !!! the appetizers or `` small plates '' were the best part of the
4 i work around the corner from uncle sal 's and was introduced to this gem by my boss . since that <unk> first encounter , i have been enjoying lunch here every other month or so for over three years . the atmosphere is cozy and relaxed . the service
2 i went to grimaldi 's for the first time last night with a large party . the service was lackluster . i 'm not sure if our waiter was overworked , having a bad day , or what ... i got there after most of our party and he immediately
3 my office ordered three 20 '' pizzas , a <unk> , and cannolis for lunch today . this was our first time ever trying joe 's . of the six picky eaters in the office , everyone liked the food . the pizzas are huge with thin , slightly chewy
4 this place is off the <unk> for <unk> . great hh , great drinks , the most amazing salsa . this place has it all . would definitely recommend to a friend , a friend of a friend and even my grandma . thank you cien agave for deliciousness every
1 let me start off by saying i would never go back . the prices did n't match the prices they had online and when questioned about it they informed me `` well these are the new higher prices '' . um seriously ? the server kept coming over every 5
4 i stumbled on to this place by accident and was very pleased that fate brought me here . great atmosphere , friendly staff , and totally had the feel of a neighborhood bar . upon recommendation i tried the deviled eggs which is definitely something i have never seen at
4 a very good sports bar - it is quite amazing just how many flat screen tv 's they can cram on every wall . also i was very impressed with their `` gorilla '' wings - you get 13 for $ 9 and have to say they are some of
4 always a great experience here ! nearly all the staff is knowledgeable about pet food and treats and what is recommended for your breed . we bathe our dogs here regularly and they always leave so soft and fluffy and smelling great . the music and fun , vibrant colors
4 just a heads up , do n't go here with the expectation that you 're getting authentic mexican food . all of us <unk> know that a really great authentic mexican restaurant almost always begins with a mexican woman 's name : -rrb- this place is very good for what
2 three stars sounds about right . my fav is the <unk> <unk> . it has potato , sausage , leeks - super good . on this occasion i tried the featured dish , the chicken marsala -lrb- chicken , mushrooms , side of roasted potatoes and peppers -rrb- . umm
3 met a friend here and was surprised ! the ice tea was simply amazing ! i got the london berry ... next time i will be trying the chai . anyhoo , it is a bit pricey * but * this isnt a `` let 's stop here every day
4 this place is as good as it gets ! amazing selection , super helpful staff , and the prices on used books can not be beat . i used to shop at bookmans until i stumbled upon this place , the prices are <unk> % cheaper on used books .
4 we have been coming here since my son was 6 months old -lrb- he is now 21/2 -rrb- this is the one place we can come and i feel 100 % comfortable letting him run around and explore . the entire museum is kid friendly and has something in every
3 i just went to trader joe 's for the first time last night ... seriously . it 's smaller than i expected , but in a good way . i stood just staring at the dried fruit and nuts like it was a maze . i was approached by a
3 we all know that these things are incredible i mean , it 's no secret ! these cupcakes are made by angels in the clouds . they are moist and full of flavor . i love the dark chocolate and the red velvet . the only thing i surprisingly do
1 i have been to salut two different times . the first time was for happy hour with a group of girlfriends and the second for mimosas . happy hour was great as far as drinks and the munchies . they have a great outdoor patio that opens up into the
4 i went here for a staycation one weekend kind of out of the blue . i mainly picked it from the pool reviews and awesome pictures . i have to admit , i was not disappointed . this place is beautiful and not to mention huge . it was really
3 this zipps is my favorite one . the location is close to home and i love i can ride my bike for a <unk> ! i stick with your standard hot wings and a strawberry <unk> . honestly , i think i 've had something different ... once . i
4 my favorite pizza joint ! great lasagna . . salads , breadsticks , and top notch desserts
4 good new mexican food . solid appetizers even chips and salsa .
4 as dependable as any other airline . have had interesting experiences never bad . .
4 i think these guys have one of the best hot subs around . i differentiate hot and cold subs because they are completely different sandwiches . there are places in town that have great cold subs but firehouse has one of the best hot subs around . i do n't
3 oh pollo fundido where have you been all of my life . i have never actually eaten here until recently . my company always gets party trays from here for our holiday open house and they are always very good and very popular with the guests and employees . one
4 i have been to the tempe location a few times in the past but never to this location . they have really good everything . sandwiches and breakfast items . they have a lox and bagel platter for two that is great . their pastrami sandwiches are awesome . so
1 man this place is just not good at all . i guess we are spoiled with the better local chain of movie theaters . i feel sorry for other people in other cities who only have amc as a choice for movie theaters . i would complain about the cost
3 this was my first time here . i am not a big art person . i appreciate it but standing for hours looking at one thing just not into it . of course i do have add so it is possible for me to stair at the weirdest things for
3 i came here for the 2nd back to drinking uye . i like this place . it is very laid back . i like how it is split into two different parts . the restaurant on one side in it 's own building and the bar on the other in
4 omg horchata ice cream !!! this is probably the best ice cream joint in the phoenix area ... i have been to churn and many others and the taste and quality just seems to stand out here at pink spot . i love the pink spot -lrb- pun <unk> -rrb-
3 totally a fan of this place since before i joined the military in <unk> . we enjoy coming to this place to forget about our diet and it 's one of my favorite `` dive 's '' ever . the jade chicken is the bomb , the hot sauce is
2 i like the cute charming older converted home that houses this restaurant . the style of the food is very different from another vietnamese i tried recently . i ordered the lemongrass chicken . what i liked most about this variation of lemongrass chicken were the beautiful assortment of steamed
1 we came in extra early for dinner on the way to an event . the place was packed and on a wait with mostly sports enthusiast also on the way to an event . that normally is a good sign that things should be running well . i did notice
2 i vowed never to return after my last experience here but was in the area and we were in need of hot cherry peppers and thought defalco 's would have them . i had the half italian beef sandwich , i liked the taste of it with the onions and
2 3.5 with the possibility of upping a star with a second visit . i had the spinach chicken and wow was that big , the chicken was nicely grilled and was over fresh plain spinach . over the warm chicken was a warm thick peanut curry sauce that was garnished
3 the exterior of the building might be unappealing but once you step in it 's whimsical and cheerful . this is a family owned <unk> style seafood restaurant that is open every day for lunch and dinner . right away they gave us house made chips , the daily made
2 this weekend i had the market sandwich that was made with very good and not tangy goat cheese , tomato and arugula the price went up to $ 12 -lrb- i think that is allot -rrb- but what bothered me the most was that the bread was different . the
1 pappadeaux is pronounced pappa dough i think of it now as pappa do n't season the food here . i really liked the building inside and out . the patio is charming and the inside looks so old fashioned and established . the wait staff looks professional and the place
2 i 've been here a few times and like many places it 's a little different each time . they always start you with a pretty good bread basket . this time the blue cheese butter was a nice <unk> temperature and you top you bread with that <unk> sauce
3 we pass this place all the time and wanted to try them since they do ok on the maricopa restaurant inspections . this place was very noisy with lots of foreign loud <unk> . the chairs are very uncomfortable but the food we had was good and did differ from
1 i knew that going to a new restaurant on opening day would have some hiccups in service and possibly food preparation . that said we decided to try barrio queen for lunch today . the idea of ordering at the window and having a seat outside was a nice idea
4 an affair not to be missed . besides the amazing participating restaurants of the valley it really was a party as we ran into friends and also great live music such as <unk> <unk> and you could walk around the art museum included . not all but many restaurants had
3 my review is only on the food from just one visit and not on the abundant selection of over thirty craft brews they offer on tap . i also noticed a selection of wines on tap and a very nice large dog friendly patio . i ordered what i think
1 i thought the food might be decent because of the very good yelp rating . my husband started with the minestrone soup . the soup was very thin and watery with a burnt taste . i note this soup did n't have any beans or pasta in it but only
4 i am undecided between four and five stars so i went with five because overall this second very good experience exceeded my expectations . we started our dinner with happy hour prices and got a pretty good bottle of wine half price for almost what it cost you at the
2 short story . a-ok but not very good at price point . i do note we only had lunch and maybe they shine more at dinner time . i also note three stars is still a positive review . long story . this is a pristine clean modern beautiful place
4 dog gone it the meal was <unk> filled with unexpected surprises and masterful execution . it was something to yelp about . you will bark about having a great meal here if you share a bunch of small plates . many of the plates come in small or regular sizes
4 spinach salad with bacon citrus vinaigrette dressing , goat cheese , red onion and house caramelized nuts @ afternoon happy hour prices . cool spot to cool your heels on a hot afternoon on the shaded , <unk> patio or the <unk> cramped wonderfully cool dining room and bar .
2 nothing fancy , but generally filling and not bad . tonight 's arroz con pollo provided a decent , filling , tasty and inexpensive meal . the dining area was -lrb- and is usually -rrb- clean , and the men 's room is adequate , seems sanitary and has always
1 i love coupons . apparently the server at cantina laredo does n't . i presented mine -lrb- free guacamole ! -rrb- and she looked horrified but returned a few minutes later with all the proper ingredients . it was fun to watch the guacamole mashed together right in front of
3 yes , yes , yes ! thank you yelp . this is one place that i will keep coming back to . the caterpillar roll , garlic tuna roll , crunchy scallop roll were beautiful and the presentation was pretty . my dining partner is not so adventurous on the
3 i recently stopped by for lunch with a group from work . i 'm upping the star rating to 4 for three reasons : 1 . the sign <unk> <unk> on the door . i like dining without guns . 2 . service was really , really good . when
3 yeah . i like dodge theatre . i like the staffers - they 're friendly and helpful . i like the bathrooms - they 're large and they 're clean . i like the music memorabilia on the walls . i like that they allow re-entry . i like that
1 the great thing about us airways is there is always something to talk about . the talk coming from my mouth is rarely good . i 've flown with `` us '' waaay too often . i can count more times that my flight was delayed and/or canceled , my
1 if you are reading this today is your lucky day ! truly . i am an on again off again food snob . maybe reformed . but no . i love fried chicken ! always on the hunt for the tender fried <unk> ... <unk> friend . i have chowed
4 * this 5 star rating is for the pizza only !!! this review is long overdue . as a matter of fact i started waiting in line to get into this joint last year and i just now had my order taken . no joke here , the lines are
3 thanks to beth g. 's review today we remembered that we 'd been here once before and liked it , so we returned for dinner tonight . i had a california <unk> . what makes it `` california '' ? classic burger veggies ? strange . it was tasty ,
1 we 've been twice now , and nothing we have had has been very good . the ice cream and cake were mediocre , the onion rings were <unk> , the burgers were way overdone and made from cheap beef . ask the bone chip in my husband 's burger
2 in the mood for a burger last night , but not willing to settle for <unk> , hubby suggested this place , to which he had been once before with a co-worker . it 's a casual , dive-y sort of place , which i like . there were a
3 i saw amy b 's review the other day , and decided to check out the breakfast joynt , as it is pretty close to where i work . the decor is a little unusual for a breakfast and lunch place - normally these places are , shall we say
3 i made arrangements for my fellow <unk> members to have an <unk> at the pam , specifically to see `` <unk> <unk> 's drawings for the <unk> , '' their current special exhibit . have i been to better art museums in this country ? sure , but i really
1 we really wanted to like lucille 's , really , we did . i married a southern boy , so as i was reading the online menu to him , he decided he really wanted to go . unfortunately for lucille 's , we 've already been to bobby q
4 the pupusas , yes , the pupusas are great . the <unk> with cheese has become our favorite , but this past week , i strayed from our standard and tried the <unk> soup with braised chicken and salad . all i can say is , `` what the hell
2 i have to admit that i 'm a tad confused by all the raves about the chips and salsa . ok - the salsa was good , but it must have been pretty mild because i could eat it . but unfortunately the chips tasted stale and even like the
3 my husband and i eat here pretty regularly . is `` traditional '' hawaiian boxed lunch fare healthy ? not so much . spam is on the menu , <unk> grilled or fried chicken , fish , or beef , sticky white rice , and the most delicious macaroni salad
3 my husband is a huge donut fan , so when i noticed this place driving down mcdowell , i suggested we go . one drawback is that they only accept cash , so we had to go to the circle k atm first . the donuts were fresh , and
4 went to elements for the first time yesterday for brunch with some friends . it was awesome ! from the food , to the view , to our extremely friendly waiter , daniel , it was an experience i wo n't soon forget . i opted for the brunch buffet
4 i may be partial to this airport since it 's my own , but i find it easy to navigate .
4 welcome to meat heaven . if you do n't like meat , stay away , you will probably faint just walking by their large , glass room of ribs just roasting <unk> ... begging you to come in and take a bite ... whatever you do , do n't eat
3 rules to go by if you are considering to come by here : 1 . do n't ever ever come here on a day that is hot . nope . do n't even try . i think i almost had a heat stroke walking on the brick trail with a
2 as soon as i stepped out of my car to go into the place , a gentleman who worked there stepped out and was throwing rice on the ground for a huge gathering of <unk> . yeah . kinda annoying while i 'm trying to go inside to eat .
1 after reading all the wonderful reviews of this place , we decided to get a babysitter for the night and plan a date night ... first off , can i just say this is the strangest location of any restaurant that i 've ever been to ? it 's like
3 i was randomly searching on google for a place to try for lunch today , and mimita 's came up . . i 've never tried cuban , but i was brave today and wanted to go for something <unk> and new . this place definitely had the unique and
2 so far my 1st time experience with this place was ... interesting . it was with my boss and 1 co-worker . i guess you can say that i 'm iffy when it comes to mixing two totally different foods together . for the most part , i 've seen
4 i always have tons of laughs and fun here . we saw dave <unk> in dec. <unk> and christopher <unk> in feb. ' 09 . . both pretty hilarious . they have great tasting food but is a bit on the pricey side ... their <unk> with <unk> <unk> is
4 lobby is sloppy . . in a good way ! i got a double cheeseburger with fries , and it was big , juicy , and hit the spot on my lunch . it was dripping with special sauce and filled up my hands , but gone oh so quickly
4 i was in the mood to stick to a budget on an afternoon full of fun with the kiddo . impossible you say ? not quite . this place was worth the drive up to scottsdale . not bad for the price of admission , it was $ 10 for
3 mmmmm ... <unk> pasta is my fav dish here -lrb- angel hair pasta , made with oregano 's own `` spicy '' marinara sauce -rrb- . only thing is that i wish it came with more marinara sauce , a bit dry without it . plus , meatballs cost extra
4 if you are looking for a place to do tequila shots , this is not the place , as they are stingy with their booze ... that was 100 % sarcasm . the patron shots are literally 3 shots in one . also just recently noticed that they have a
4 the best cupcakes i 've ever had period . perfectly moist , perfectly sweet . plus they are organic ! i picked up some organic cupcakes from whole foods over the weekend -lrb- just because i was there -rrb- , and they were awful ... the lesson ? organic cupcakes
4 i love this place ! i 've been here twice for lunch and once for dinner and have yet to be disappointed . the last time i went here , i got the fried egg sandwich for lunch - it was very good . a bit messy though - i
3 i 'm a sucker for charming places and this is one of them . it 's a perfect place for a date , girls lunch or dinner with mom . i live and work near here and ca n't believe i did n't try it until spring restaurant week !
4 i 've been wanting to try this place for awhile and we finally did last weekend . we will definitely be back soon ! i got eggs cooked <unk> , potatoes , bacon and toast . all was delish and their coffee was great too . my fiance got pancakes
3 it 's dangerous that i can walk to this place in about three minutes . their shakes are amazing . best ever . their burgers are great too , as are their fries . in fact , all i need is a shake and some fries from this place and
3 wow , i am amazed at how such an amazing , chic , cute , and inviting place like this can be in downtown phoenix , no offense . the phoenix area continues to surprise me with these little gems that are full of delicious food , yummy drinks ,
3 i am impressed with the food and service here . i was initially looking to enjoy some delicious korean food , but the place that i wanted to visit were closed on a sunday . i then opted for vietnamese food . i am rather new to arizona , but
2 okay , so i am rather new to town and have been to very famous and not so famous soul food restaurants around the world , and this one is to me , only decent . i decided to try this restaurant out today after visiting an historical church for
1 i 've frequented teakwoods for the past 10 years . and this place has changed for the worse . it used to be a trendy <unk> <unk> bar with cute and friendly waitresses . the crowd used to be a young educated crowd who would come here for drinks before
2 the problem with bandera is everyone waits at the bar prior to getting seated . well how is that a problem you might ask since that is normal everywhere else ... the problem is that they order their meal , are <unk> through it and then move to their tables
3 i thought they closed the mesa restaurant -lrb- i was there over a year ago -rrb- . anyway , `` i 've been to this one and the one on central in phoenix . the food is excellent . in terms of food only , i think it 's arguably
2 i agree with david m and ada g. regarding the service in the bar . if you go here , do not dine in the bar . the hostess might tell you its full service at the bar but the service at the bar is noticeably lacking . if you
3 finally made it to tryst , i have been meaning to try this place for at least 8-10 months . we came here for a late breakfast before a doctor 's appointment . hubby had diet coke and i had decaf coffee . hubby ordered the breakfast burrito and i
3 went here for lunch by recommendation of a friend at the office . the best part is going with someone that knows the menu as i am not familiar with vietnamese cuisine . he ordered for both of us and i was not disappointed . some bowl with rice noodles
3 went here for dinner on <unk> , party of 3 . i got a coupon in the mail for $ 8 off 2 entrees . kudos to outback , the coupon says ` or $ 4 off one entree ' , which is something i like , you should not
2 we were looking for a buffet with crab legs and this place fit the bill . it is a little far from home and we took the risk . i have not been to many chinese buffets lately so i thought this place was a little pricier , at about
2 food : a ` <unk> , i guess . dishes requested mild came out spicier than things requested medium . authenticity seems lacking . if this place were a little larger , i would say that it 's popularity combined with its <unk> would garner it my new ubiquitous phrase
3 a nice different option for lunch , my brother and i enjoyed the burgers recently . they were offered in an assortment of sizes and toppings , but since it was the first time there , i opted for a plain burger on a pretzel bun . the flavor and
2 they do n't have the largest menu selection , and the food 's pretty average . we mostly like going for breakfast , not for dinner , due to the better selection . there are the usual choices , but everything is done well , with hearty portions . if
3 while not my favorite indian buffet , this one was pretty good . there was a fairly large and varied selection . i found everything i had to be tasty , just <unk> to be flavored towards the bland end of mild . i also found all of the dishes
2 the <unk> you expect . not really anything especially bad or especially nice to say . chips warm and fresh , but salsa was kind of `` <unk> <unk> '' bleh . large portion . great coupon .
2 in short : too chic for its own good , food is ok , ambiance is unique : for good or worse . i went here on a whim because frankly the place looks <unk> cool . the atmosphere is always happening and lots of good looking people just hanging
2 in short : food was tasty but i 've had much better . in the end the experience was a letdown . i really had high hope for stacy 's , after all top ten is top ten . never even heard of this place before that but i i
4 this is a great ball field . clean , welcoming design , nice staff , and <unk> for a ballgame . sweet ! time for my first d-backs game ...
3 superb combo of tasty food , comfortable setting , and good for you . we started with the shrimp dumplings -lrb- pretty good -rrb- and the chicken tortilla soup -lrb- yummy though i usually hate beans -rrb- . we were n't sure about the kids ' menu items . they
1 average to a little less than average . staff was rushed and left me to call them over to get our check . waitress then looked at her tip with me sitting there . did n't mind looking back at her while it seemed like she thought about asking for
4 impressive every time have been back a few times since my last review . visited yesterday and all is still excellent . pizzas remain incredibly yummy , service is fast and kind , and it 's an excellent choice when you have kids . the dough they give <unk> to
4 i generally wont eat donut 's not worth the calories , however their donuts are simply amazing light airy with a nice <unk> to the outside - simply amazing i recommend the coconut glazed with the <unk> on the top -lrb- looks kind of like the gem hostess donuts -rrb-
4 fantastic place , mario and peter -lrb- owners -rrb- are awesome finally adding this review to my yelp i went there last night -lrb- this isnt really last night it is few months ago - it is still excellent not too -rrb- and it was excellent - the beer list
4 love love love x 1000 . this place lived up to all of our expectations and recommendations and i only wish i would have checked it out sooner . we went on a crowded saturday night with some friends and made sure to have reservations . the staff was beyond
0 why do people go here and spend money ? this place is overpriced and the food is awful . plain awful . on my visit , there was 2 people other than our party in the restaurant and it took about 3 minutes to be seated and about 25 minutes
4 how can you not enjoy oregano 's ? the service at this location is always great and friendly staff . the seating is about as ample as it gets for an oregano 's and the fact that they are always busy , says something , they are popular cause they
3 i have to say there is not much than can go wrong with a restaurant the specializes in wine , cheese and all things italian . went on a saturday night while a holiday fair was being had so getting to the location was a bitch . parking is pretty
1 had a deal chicken for this place and heard it was fabulous so i spent $ 49 on a deal chicken ... i was really very very very disappointed with this place . the service was awful , which should have been my first sign . the food , especially
4 love love love ... this store is where to go to be dressed in the latest <unk> and name brands . sometimes it is chaotic and picked over but by far has the best selections and really great staff . always good inventory . this is a must go ,
3 now this is the way to see a baseball game . you are sectioned high above the actual field , so you get a decent view of everything going on , your own waitress , food/drinks and real plates . lol . seriously though , for a special event or
1 there is nothing really stand out about this place . the service is crap , the food is overpriced and <unk> and its expensive for bar food . i believe this place is frequented as it has prime real estate right on <unk> and you can see it from the
1 really hit or miss . first of all , the atmosphere is terrific . modern , minimalist , big open spaces . very nice . <unk> patio , when the weather is right , would be lovely for cocktails and food , around a fire pit . i 've eaten
4 it 's just a terrific steakhouse . one of the most upscale , all around dining experiences in phoenix . it 's expensive . very expensive . but probably worth it . figure $ <unk> for a couple . i had the double filet <unk> with blue cheese melted and
4 my favorite breakfast place . love the food , love the prices , love the decor . but ... hate the wait . they know me . my wife and i bring our two small kids here every week or two . but our average wait time , sitting in
1 used to live three blocks away . went here twice . both times , very dissapointed . i mean , the food is mediocre at best . and it 's way overpriced . if i 'm going to pay this price , i expect good food ... maybe even great
1 we 've eaten here twice . both on weekend , one for breakfast , one for lunch . setting is great . nice atmosphere . service is fair . friendly , but not overly attentive . food is just okay . here is the great thing about them for breakfast/lunch
4 based on my last review , the owner , louis , took the time to address my concern and offer me a gift card . now that is amazing customer service . thank you louis for taking the time .
4 we , three , went to check out the stick that 's been talking and come to find out , it does have a lot to say . we sat in the shadow <unk> it up with some wine , good music , and dancing . it was a mature
3 a great space where you can see a live band or sing karaoke as well as enjoy authentic vietnamese cuisine . owner is passionate about what he is doing and makes sure everyone leaves satisfied . if you have any issue ask for <unk> he will make it right .
3 great local joint to hang out and grab a drink or a bite . excellent food and oysters .
2 family run small business in tempe . everything was tasty but not terribly exciting . very limited options . seems authentic .
4 great prices . my daughter and i ate there for $ 12 and walked out stuffed . it 's definitely not authentic mexican but it is still good . i got the green chili chimichanga and a beef taco . both were fantastic for the money . the only knock
0 food was alright but i thought it was a bit overpriced for fast food mexican that 's really nothing special or unique . me and my wife went there and it was over $ 20 and i was just barely full . it 's a better value to just go
4 i 'll admit it : i 've gotten old . i hate going out on nye . i hate dealing with the drunk masses that inevitably have popped collars and think <unk> blue ribbon is the <unk> . sure , i could solve that problem by going to a friend
3 we found this place while walking in downtown for a first friday event . i immediately loved the decor -lrb- exposed brick , some art on the walls , a really warm feel to it -rrb- and was instantly hooked by the smell wafting out of the front door .
0 ** full disclosure ** i only came here for drinks , not the food . a group of us walked into carly 's after our holiday lunch in order to grab some drinks and get our evening started . we were greeted with a look of disgust -lrb- we werent
4 if it 's possible , my love for postino has only increased . i decided to throw a baby shower for my friend here , and it turned out beautifully . i never had a problem with my calls being returned , and the managers i spoke to were extremely
2 i 've been wanting to try this place for awhile after hearing good things about it and reading the menu . i realize now why the website does n't list prices -- the mission is <unk> overpriced ! we ended up on the patio since they were n't seating in
4 i 've been meaning to try this place since it opened , and i finally got around to it this week . now i 'm mad i waited so long ! i have tried many veggie burgers in my life , and i think i may have found `` the
4 i 'm sort of hanging my head in shame writing this review because i 'm normally very vocal and blunt about my hatred of chain restaurants . however , my heart <unk> with joy when i think about all the vegetarian options available at yard house . i wish more
3 what i love about this place is the selection and the prices . they are cheaper than other stores about 90 % of the time . i love it when their ads have the $ 15 off a $ 100 wine purchase coupons . i have a list organized by
1 based on my first visit , i would have happily given la condesa a 4 star review . my veggie tacos were delicious , and i loved all the fun salsas . i could n't get enough of them ! really , the only negative was the cramped quarters .
4 after dining here almost every day of his <unk> vacation , the rob has decided that it is not a grease that comes off some of the burgers , -lrb- as previously stated -rrb- but a sort of au jus sauce , the contents of which is trying to break
2 let 's deal with the elephant in the room first ... this place is totally in an old fazoli 's . not that there 's anything wrong with that , but it 's the same <unk> as the generic mexican joint housed in what was clearly a pizza hut once
3 took the light rail from downtown to postino 's on a saturday -- felt downright cosmopolitan ! got there just before 4pm , earning me a few bucks off my first glass of wine . the patio was just about full , and within an hour there was a waiting
2 mediocre food the night we went , but it was busy and late so i did n't mind terribly . wine was tasty and reasonably priced , and the place had a fun atmosphere rolling . there was a fire pit and band out back , and <unk> tunes inside
3 it 's a cool little downtown bar , with a bit of a portland or seattle feel to it . dinky house , old dark wood <unk> , neat art on the walls , and for the most part a fun , relaxed clientele . conversations with strangers just seem
3 good selection of non-fat flavors and good selection of toppings .
3 if you 're looking for a great breakfast sandwich , this is the place to go to ! my husband and i have have tried several ones and none have disappointed . each bagel sandwich is about $ 7 - $ 8 but they 're a decent size .
1 great place to people watch -lrb- went on a friday night -rrb- . this place is connected to the bowling alley and tries to be a bar and a club combined into one . i do n't think they did a very well job of it though .
3 came for my first taco tuesday -lrb- ever -rrb- . sat by the bar - the bartenders were nice and always kept a good eye on our beer . husband and i tried a bunch of tacos . the $ 2 ones were okay , but we both like the
4 been dying to come here ever since i saw this place on unique eats . very laid back gastropub with a friendly , <unk> staff ! we grabbed drinks at the bar first - moe ` <unk> mule -lrb- ginger beer , cucumber , lime , rocks -rrb- & the
2 3.5 stars nice ambiance , okay food , good beer on tap . we went for reverse happy hour -lrb- $ 2 off of <unk> apps , half off pizza -rrb- . we tried the avocado egg rolls , ahi poke , and nachos . the egg rolls were pretty
3 3.5-4 stars pretty packed bar on a saturday . we went when they were doing beer from all over . it was nice to be able to try different kinds of beer -lrb- ~ $ 6 -rrb- . the crowd was a mix between older people and 20-30 year olds
2 it 's a great setup so seats probably are n't that bad no matter where you sit , but the venue itself ca n't handle the number of people they can cram in there . there is always like a half hour of waiting in traffic just to get in
3 had the croque madame for breakfast and it was fantastic . delicious albeit a little pricey for what came on the plate -lrb- one egg ? boo . -rrb- my only qualm was that it was busy even on a monday morning and the employees do n't seem terribly happy
4 i went to cph with my siblings on a saturday night and we had a blast . i felt like we were actually in a restaurant in nyc . tables are fairly close together and it was packed , but nothing overwhelming . the cocktails are fantastic and we each
4 hands down the best pizza in az ! favorite place to take out of town guests . make sure you order the burrata . best appetizer that will be inhaled . perfect blend of fresh homemade mozzarella , prosciutto , balsamic vinegar and toasted bread . the pizza is second
3 great go to place at the biltmore . the quality and service is always right on . i have never had food at hillstone that i did n't love . now , they do n't <unk> their contents and calories of their dishes so i may be loving some heavy
2 we 've been making our way out to the harkins shea theaters since the amc esplanade is under a remodel . shea works well for us because the location is close and a great selection of restaurants nearby . this theater gets a respectful clientele so you wo n't have
2 great place to watch a game . service was great and very attentive . with all that said the food was just so so . we did like the buffalo wings , great spice with a delicious tangy sauce . we were pretty disappointed with the chicken tenders and burger
3 huge fan of royal ! i have been to both the royal bar at union and storefront in the biltmore . love their lattes either hot or cold . i prefer the union location just because of the seating outside is nicer than the other location at the biltmore .
3 alright , i am reviewing an airport . i have been thru a ton of airports in my life and i would have to say that phoenix is one of the easier and friendlier airports . i guess if you grade on a curve phoenix would be one of the
3 kettle one martini 's with blue cheese olives , medium rare steak and a dark bar ! yeah , there is a pretty good chance you will find me in a place like this . i am drooling as i write this review . the capital grille at the biltmore
2 i want to love this place ... i love the concept , i love the ingredients , i love the flavors . however , i 'm not as much of a fan as i 'd like to be . was meeting a foodie friend to try herb box out for
1 i 've been to saddle ranch twice , once for weekend brunch/lunch and once for a night out . brunch/lunch : huge portions ... i mean huge ! i had an ahi tuna wrap -lrb- i know , totally <unk> -rrb- and it was decent ; a little <unk> ,
4 i love in-n-out ! i love their burgers . i 'm obsessed with their strawberry shakes ! and their fries are never soggy .
3 i 'm surprised with how peaceful the green belt is ! i just moved to `` old town '' and it 's totally my favorite part of the move !!! i 've been running soo much more !
4 oh my gosh !!! if you have not tried bertha 's cafe , you , my <unk> , are sorely missing out . great lunch . i mean really , truly great . if i could give bertha 's 6 stars , i would , darn it . from the
4 excellent food and service !!! we make a point to visit this restaurant at least once a week . i always order the famous chicken salad or the french dip but my husband orders many different things on the menu and they are all wonderful . dessert is a must
4 amazing place to eat . the cornbread is wonderful , it melts in your mouth . i have had just about every meal here and my favorite is the filet or the ribs . always great !
3 yum ! the ambiance in this place is a bit weird - it feels like a 1960 's thai diner - but the food and service are both fantastic . i tried out the thai hut fried rice and my husband had the drunken noodles . both were delish .
2 i wish i could do three and a half stars for this one . we called for takeout . i got the vegetarian soba noodles with tofu , and my husband had some shrimp and beef thing . when he got home and i opened the boxes , mine had
3 my husband and i had a great late dinner here . we had been told by a neighbor it was a `` hole in the wall '' , so we were a little surprised by the -lrb- slightly high -rrb- price of the entrees . the food was delicious -lrb-
3 a <unk> grocery store . sweet ! fresh and easy has a great layout . the shelves are low and the aisles are wide . they have a lot of their own products -lrb- similar to trader joe 's in that way -rrb- . their stuff is really affordable !
3 i had a new experience today at the market : a <unk> wait to check out ! one <unk> farm had all kinds of produce this week -lrb- apples , pears , corn , peppers , tomatoes , eggplant , potatoes ... -rrb- . i got to the market around
1 not that good . average at best . . no bok <unk> and pho was served warm this was <unk> rolls were good but $ 3.50 per roll are overpriced . very limited menu for my liking - pho <unk> in tempe off elliott rd is preferred , much better
3 love happy hour , fish taco special are the bomb . . big ass burger is good as it gets !! excellent prices ! l
4 this is some of the best pizza in town . you would never know it if you were n't looking for it . everything here is good . great place for pizza , wine and sit outside and watch the people walk by .
1 this place is pretty disgusting . there has never been anything here that after i ate it i said `` man am i glad i ate that '' . the happy hour is a good deal because you get beer and free gross food . if you eat here ,
4 so let 's see ... your hungry ... you want an awesome sandwich ... buffalo chicken ... cheddar cheese ... chipotle mayo ... . on toasted wheat bread . sounds great right ... but how about i add the fact that you can simply take a sharpie ... mark all

2 the interior of gold bar looks like a hip , arty 75 year old woman 's living room . the coffee is good -lrb- <unk> bros. -rrb- but pricey . really pricey . but that may have something to do with its being located directly across the parking lot from
3 from the <unk> `` he/she '' bathrooms to the big-ass `` look at what you 're missing '' windows , to the rotating and -lrb- usually -rrb- interesting art <unk> , the ambiance at az 88 boasts a sort of funky , yet arrogant <unk> that is unique . the

3 we stopped in here after a brisk walk from the light rail and were immediately greeted , even before stepping in . inside , it was busy . virtually every table was sat and the bar was full . maybe it had to do with the building itself , but

4 stopped by here after my friend got a tattoo at golden rule and this food is amazing . their menu for lunch is pretty simple , a list of sandwiches and some appetizers . my friend got a wrap and i got the cuban along with some orzo pasta salad
2 we went here last night for mother 's day and the only fantastic thing about it was the tableside guacamole . i had the carnitas which were so spicy i could barely eat one . the apple pie was so hot that it burned me which i still have a

1 carolinas , your enchiladas ruined it for me . i ca n't imagine eating another one of your soggy tortillas swamped in a pool of the most horrifying enchilada sauce my taste buds have ever met . mole overload and non-existent chile . lacking any real taste to it whatsoever
1 after <unk> discovering that matt 's big breakfast is closed on mondays -lrb- <unk> -rrb- , my girlfriend and i headed off to over easy to grab a hearty breakfast . we got there at <unk> on a monday morning , and waited 15 minutes for a table . a

3 you know what makes this place so awesome ? they sell gluten-free beer called <unk> -lrb- made by <unk> <unk> -rrb- . you heard it right . beer without wheat or barley . sounds crazy but it 's actually quite good - somewhere between a light blue moon and kiltlifter
3 i really loved this place ! do n't know what the reviews are bad because i had a great experience . we started with the chips and guac and there was a ton of guac and it was so delicious . i had the tacos which were awesome and lots

2 great brisket - it 's the only thing i ever get . as for everything else - i have n't a clue . but damn ! their brisket is tasty . i think they could probably use some general business improvement like accepting credit cards , managing a line ,
4 this place gets a bump because it could easily pass for a set in a john woo film and because there 's just so much bad chinese food in the phoenix . like a person that looks better by hanging around ugly friends , ace benefits similarly . many reviewers
1 friendly service and a funky throwback ambiance make this place a fun alternative to delicious food . i love a good hot dog , but i 'm not convinced that ted 's serves one . still , it may be worth a trip to bask in their quirky ambience ...
1 i judge a soul food place by its fried chicken , a donut shop by its old fashioned , an ice cream place by its vanilla , and a greek place by it 's gyros . the gyros here are bland and wholly <unk> - and sourced from the same
3 me and `` the julio '' down by the <unk> .

4 is there anything better than eating a green chili beef frybread at the fry bread house while journey 's separate ways blasts in the background ? i think not .
2 i guess i 'm supposed to hate this place ; its a chain , its usually crowded , the juke boxes are stupid . but , i feel comfortable there and i enjoy the food . what can i say ? its better than denny 's . i like it
0 their crappy fish gave my wife food poisoning and their <unk> of asu <unk> made me want to vomit myself . -lrb- not to mention the blue <unk> they have in their fake pond outside . what the hell is that about ? -rrb- i will never go to this
4 i love this place ! i have found some great mid century lamps , <unk> , tables and other stuff that i have proudly displayed in our house . the prices are very reasonable and the staff is friendly .
3 i like this place . the staff is very friendly , helpful and knowledgeable . its the only place in central phoenix that has the cat and dog food we use .
4 they have a train to ride , carousel , ice cream shop , huge playground , and outdoor cafe . what more can you ask for ?
1 i have been here way too many times but i am officially done giving them chances . so frustrating that this place does n't step it up ! it is pretty much an overpriced bar . they have a large selection of just mediocre bar food . i love the
4 awesome atmosphere and great paninis . price was reasonable too !
4 yummy ! you have to have a serious appetite to finish a plate from here . the half omelette is bigger than any full i 've seen . and someone at a table near by got the pancakes and they were huge ! there was 4 of us that all
4 my newest addiction here is the oatmeal . it is made with quinoa , which sounds a little odd . do n't knock it until you try it , you wo n't regret it ! have i mentioned how awesome the staff here is too ?! this is my favorite
1 i really hate to give this place a bad review , but i have to keep it real . i was very disappointed with the food here . i ordered takeout and a friend picked it up so i was n't able to scope out the ambiance . so this
4 great environment , good wine selection , the butchers block is very tasty , and my all time fav here , the prosciutto bruschetta with figs & mascarpone . one of the best prosciutto bruschetta 's i 've ever had .
3 great place for groups . they have a decent happy hour . the sushi is very americanized , but it tastes pretty darn good .
3 nice ambiance and good seafood for az . . would definitely recommend this place . waiter also gave us free dessert !

4 sweet tomatoes , you can have your 4th star back and a 5th for good measure . you 've redeemed yourself from the field kitchen fiasco and are once again the all-you-can-eat salad bar we 'd come to know and love . the cool thing is that this location got
4 ok , so usually i expect chinese places to all be the usual stir fry style , takeout menu , not really unique kind of food . which is ok , because i love that particular food . but something sets phoenix palace a notch above the rest . the

1 since my review , i 've been informed that wob has different glassware for different pours . so the specific glass i was served in was a <unk> glass , intended for cans or bottles , not their normal pint glass . i have n't confirmed this , but it
1 i 've now been to this location 3 times . i had previously visited the locations and really enjoyed my meals . unfortunately , something seems to be missing here at the `` downtown '' location . the service has been haphazard each time i 've gone . the waitstaff
1 just o.k. . it has a pretty weird vibe . good beer served by <unk> school kids . i ordered the beer of the month , full sail session . came in a 11 oz bottle . which , when poured into one of their `` pint '' glasses ,
4 short leash , hmmm , what can i say . if you love dogs , hot dogs and food in general , this place is the only way to go . look them up on facebook , get <unk> calendar and follow them around . my wife and i love
4 fantastic food , fantastic location , very very cool . not too expensive , totally worth it . does wonders for the poor phoenix downtown scene . i love it . downtown love have fun
3 great pizza and philly cheese steaks . i 'm a big fan .
2 first time here , i was underwhelmed by the food . crabcakes were pretty tasty , but the tilapia and veggies were not good at all . our server was wonderful , he did a great job . the food was just not worth the price .
4 sandwich heaven ! believe the hype . this place is fantastic . gets packed at lunch , but worth the wait . i always get the super sicilian . y u m m y !
3 the apricot bbq feta chicken sandwich is what dreams are made of . i wan na try other dishes , but i always go back to my good old <unk> .
3 i went there since its pretty close to the house and my husband has gone there more than a couple times . i ordered the egg flower soup and won ton soup -lrb- i was sick and need soup to comfort me -rrb- . the egg flower soup was nothing
3 i 'm still full with all the delicious food from wcg ! ordered the shrimp cocktail which had 6 jumbo shrimp with 2 different sauces . i had the half rack ribs and chicken which i liked them both . had the side of corn salad since the server said
3 great all natural selection , if you are looking for some fruit or veggie that is hard to find , try here , they will probably have it . i also love that they have organic roasted chickens -lrb- yummy -rrb- . the stores often have wine tastings and <unk>
4 very fresh tasty and interesting paletas and for your canine companion they make <unk> -lrb- how cute is that ! -rrb- . i had the watermelon mint and the <unk> basil yesterday and both were awesome . give this awesome local business your business .
2 this place is a notch above most local chain mexican joints - better than el <unk> , macayos , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . its a colorful place , reasonably priced , good atmosphere , and easy to park . i used to eat at julio 's to
4 <unk> , <unk> ... we have a winner ! i used to frequent this establishment in las vegas when i lived there , and now , all of a sudden , 17 years later ... i work down the street from this place ! yippee for me ! clean <unk>
3 love this place for strange reasons i guess ... i love their cole slaw , fries , and burgers ! its sort of a swanky joint , and you would n't think the items i mentioned would be that great ... but , they are ! classy atmosphere , other
2 very good service , food was pretty good , liked the atmosphere as well . does n't stand out that much , as far as being exceptional food or anything unique or different , hence the 3 star rating . would go back again ... in a year .
2 flo 's is good , not great . killer lunch specials on saturdays , 5 bucks . it 's loud in there , and the service is ok . ca n't get too excited about this place , but it is right around the corner from where we live ,
2 meh . the beer 's good . food ok . i 'll go here , but never my 1st choice . or 5th ...
3 shimogamo is easy to miss tucked away in the corner of this strip mall next to c-fu gourmet . make the effort to find it , it 's well worth it ! not a huge raw fish fan , so i always <unk> interested in the other stuff a ``
2 note : this review is of the chandler fashion mall location . not too terribly over priced for a mall restaurant . ok selection of regular menu items and a fairly good selection of sushi . they also had a number of gluten free selections . i had the jerk
3 i 'm really surprised at some of the lackluster reviews . sometimes when i read yelp reviews i get the feeling some reviewers feel chain restaurants can do no right ! how unfair ! i believe benihana is one such place . if you 're coming for the show ,
4 wow ! great food . my wife and i went for lunch today and were very pleased with the meal . the strong but delicate flavor profiles were evident that the chef here know what -lrb- s -rrb- he is doing . first off , they deliver a basket of
0 what an awful experience . pizza was rather good however , the service at this place is abysmal . we thought that the menu was lacking in options and seemed rather limited . with the lack of options on the menu it 's hard to feed picky children . you
4 really good experience here . to bad its so far away from my home and office . anywho , had a business meeting at the <unk> and took my sales director here for dinner and discussion afterward . as soon as you walk in your smell italian . reminded me
3 good stuff ! be prepared to try every single flavor in there . you ca n't just go in and order . try as many as you like - until you feel the server is fed up with you . the girl behind the counter was patient as she <unk>
3 checked out the vig uptown for lunch . it was n't as crowded as i 'd heard it gets . that was good . got in . airy and spacious . 50 's architecture inside . the back patio feels like your outdoors but your in . wanted to sit
3 i have n't been to one of these in a looong time ... took my girl and a buddy of mine out tonight and had some good breakfast ... all 3 of us with tip ran me $ 37 ... not shabby . - lots of food ... i had
4 it 's funny because i lived in chandler for years , drove past this place tons of times and always said i wanted to try it out ... never did , until last thursday . i went back that day for dinner also ... soo good . went with a
2 this is a hard one because their food is so good and in such large portions but everytime i 've been there the service is really slow and crappy . was there for dinner on monday and whilst there was n't many people in there we still had to wait
3 i see papago as a starter location for trail runners and bikers alike . there 's no hard <unk> that will challenge a seasoned mtn biker or trail runner but there 's plenty of good speed trails to hit cardio and do a nice tour of the park . there
2 i 'm a happy hour <unk> ... i never go there otherwise but get a bunch of rolls half off and some beers . . ca n't complain a bit .
3 i fly in and out of here all the time and even though terminal 2 is a dump , if you 're flying on alaska airlines , it is quick and dirty to get in , out and home ...
3 went here for the coldplay concert and was very impressed !! this is one of the nicest arenas i have seen . the food vendors were top notch and name brand as opposed to the generic food you get in most venues . beer was expensive , but hey ,
3 really good food but too greasy for my liking ! expensive for the type of food they serve . very friendly staff .
4 every time i go to yc '' s i always have a great experience . service is great , food is good , place is always clean ! the price is the best because it 's not expensive but the food is awesome . making your own sauces is a
3 i have to say that i really enjoyed my experience last night dining at the parlor . the space is <unk> and was very well redone . i was impressed just by walking up to the entrance from the parking lot . the food was delicious ; we started off
0 let me share my spinato 's experience with you . i have had their pizza a few times , but the last time was the last . and i mean it . the last experience was with their food i ordered `` traditional vegetarian '' , with added <unk> .
3 while not the absolute best thai in town , i really enjoyed my dinner tonight at thai basil . i read about the possible wait , and at 5:30 i was able to choose any table i wanted . inside it is very clean , small but cute . we
4 eden 's grill has to be one of my favorite , and newly discovered middle <unk> restaurant in the phx metro . located in a sleepy strip mall , close to <unk> 's ace , is eg . my partner and i had the opportunity to have dinner here a
2 i heard they was about to <unk> this place , and in a way they did . a smaller more dense menu and a focus on what i feel they can handle . kudos to this <unk> . again , my previous comment stands - this place is what it
3 i guess i should only review the venue and not the bands they are booking , but the bands they are booking are a great part of the pleasure i get out of this establishment . / atmosphere & crowd i go here for the metalhead kind of concerts ,
1 this is a <unk> . it 's not good , it 's not bad . it has the same value as fast food , but a little nice and therefore you will pay more . it 's a place i visited while moving . i chose it because i could
3 happy hour at milagro was nice . it can seem a little pricey of it 's not happy hour , but i think that milagro has found a good middle ground between fusion with a mexican twist and just another <unk> . the service was excellent . nicely dressed staff
1 i must agree with some of the other reviewers , that the place is nice and all but the sandwiches are nothing special . i mean they are very basic , and there is nothing wrong with that , but if i want a basic sandwich i will make it
4 -lrb- this review is not of the actual hotel , but the new years eve event they hosted -rrb- an <unk> to valley ho . ok , so it was new years eve and i found myself at the hotel valley ho , and i thought it was amazing .
2 dont let the <unk> looking plaza fool you . i almost passed on this place due to the <unk> of the outside , but inside there was a busy and loud business that impressed . so you have chosen not to support the system by going to a private business
3 i like lustre bar . it 's a roof top pool lounge . that 's 4 awesome words in a row ! i have never been here when it has been really packed , but i 'd love to see it . i have been here a few times when
4 `` we can pay the farmer now or the doctor later . '' this was a quote on the back of their daily specials commenting about the price . it really does sum it up ! this place values the quality and preparation of its food and you really can
2 i want to love this place as much as my colleagues do . . the place is just okay for me . for starters , we 've tried the lobster bisque , calamari , fish cakes , ceviche -lrb- a favorite -rrb- , and the ahi wontons -lrb- another favorite
3 it 's a good happy hour after a long day at work to wait out the traffic mess . the bartenders are very friendly and the cocktails are delicious . great selection of beer too . but my favorite thing about it is the old movies that play -lrb- with
2 it 's a good place for lunch in phoenix . the food is inexpensive and the service is always friendly . they also <unk> but the last time i ordered delivery , it was well over an hour by the time my food arrived . i either eat there now
3 the lunch menu is good and the fruit salad with the sandwich makes an awesome duo . it 's a little pricy , but well worth it .
1 good , but there are better restaurants in the area -lrb- for lunch -rrb- . it 's <unk> to go there if you work in the area . i avoided this place because there were always people from my office here ! their selection is great , but their employees
4 only eaten here once or twice and it was so-so . i really come here for the dancing and drinking ! i 've never had a bad time here . there 's definitely something for everyone here . you can sit in a booth or at the bar inside or
0 warning : cougar crossing ! if you are a young man and want to get down with an older , nice looking woman - go here . everyone else ... do n't bother !
1 for the second go around -lrb- i had to go back to meet up with some people who chose this location before i could object -rrb- , i gave daily dose a clean slate . i went in expecting nothing and that 's about what i was given ... again
3 well hello khai hoan ! you 've been there all along and i never knew ! great pho and spring rolls , pretty standard decor ... no music . do n't go for a first date , but go for your second , third , and fourth ! try the
3 pablo picasso salad . enough said . but i 'll go on ... oregano 's is awesome on so many levels : portion size , price , staff friendliness , menu offerings , locations , decor , etc. etc. etc. . i 've been to oregano 's more times than
4 oh postino ... how i love you . there 's really nothing that needs to be said other than go there ! i 've been nearly a dozen times now and i 've literally never been let down . i like to sit at the bar when i can ,

3 a + + + for the patio that you can sit on during the hot ass summers . the food was pretty good -lrb- i had a burger with fries -rrb- but i do n't recommend the ice cream cake for dessert . next time , i 'll skip the
2 with all the competition , you 've got to step it up a notch , yogurtology ! last time i went there had been a change in the texture of the yogurt to something a little more dense than usual ... similar to soft serve ice cream . and ,
2 sprinkles is one of those places that you have to try for yourself . even though i was forewarned , i <unk> insisted that i needed to experience it . i went on a sunday night near closing time and there were a steady stream of customers fighting over the
4 i was tired of burger and fries so i agreed to try <unk> , wow ! i did half of a roast beef sandwich and the cheese soup , i am hooked . a nice value for some very tasty food , and bread bowl is a nice touch too
3 ok , this is a follow up to my first visit . had to go to luke <unk> for blood work and dental appointment afterwards so i took mary to johnny fox 's ... this entire menu is half off <unk> so we were told as we came in .
3 introducing the attitude of an irish pub with the atmosphere of a nice lounge . classy . or as classy as i can be when i 'm pretty buzzed * and yelling at the <unk> game . i was n't going for either team , so i just laughed at
2 a decent , medium-sized venue that books shows good enough to keep you coming back , but just has a few annoying aspects that prevents me from becoming a fan . first of all , whoever <unk> for marquee needs to stop <unk> about ticket prices . all over the
3 finally , i catch this place while it 's still open ! admit it , fellow yelpers , you , too have arrived here too late at some point . it was definitely worth going out of my way . the place was even <unk> than it looked from the
3 truly the best brulee i 've had on this side of the atlantic . fairly priced , and really convenient containers , so i could put a lid on it and save my cup of deliciousness for later ... not that it 's destined to last i appreciate the use
4 used a yelp deal for the first time here . sweet ! every few steps on roosevelt lead to good times , but filmbar sets new standards for a more groovy nighttime experience . the tap selection , while small , excels in the taste factor . pear cider ?
3 not sure how i did n't have a review up already ... this yard house was my very first bar when i turned 21 ! totally worth it . first of all , the beer selection is massive . you will find something you undoubtedly like . ditch the domestics
3 easily one of the best day drinking spots in the valley , especially to watch a game . first of all , the appetizers are just crazy cheap during happy hour , and it way generous portions at that . $ 3.75 for a plate of decent calamari ? sweet
4 ca n't i just show you some pictures of hanny 's , give it six stars , and call it a day ? no ? i have to be more descriptive in reviews ? fine . this place rocks . shut up and sit down at the bar . order
1 i like the cozy , home-style atmosphere . i like the cashier 's charming , inviting attitude . i like the options for toppings . i like the dessert selection . i like your prices . but i just ca n't get into your pizza . maybe it 's my
2 tonto does a good job of <unk> southwestern flair into the menu with prickly pear margaritas and bison steaks . i just get the feeling that sometimes one can go too far . salmon with bbq sauce ? my short ribs were nicely cooked but they were smothered in a
3 i started going here when they were on northern and have n't looked back . i 'm not sure why they have a menu as the star of the show is the fresh made pasta . they bring it by on a plate and tell you what is fresh for
2 happy hour meatballs before the game . add a beer and it 's all good .
2 if you want a quiet place to work this is the perfect spot . there is a limited selection of food and the prices seem to be a bit high and every time i have been here the staff does not seem to be happy to be there . is
4 i have never been disappointed by the food here . this postinos location is my favorite mostly because the staff is always friendly . if you want a great meal , great wine or beer in a trendy and upbeat atmosphere then this postinos would be my first recommendation every
3 if i am stranded on a desert island i want it to be with some <unk> toast and jam from lola with a soy latte on the side . the quiches would be a close second , as would the savory scones . and the blueberry tart of course .
3 it 's all about the fish and chips . the four stars , that is . light and crisp and moist ... with malt vinegar on the chips . . ohhh yeah , it 's that good . the other food i 've had has been fine - a couple
1 i guess i prefer false food . after three visits , the juices are the only items that impress me . the edamame dumplings are bland ; so is the soup - i can not even remember which soup i had , which is not a good <unk> on its
1 a disappointing <unk> of <unk> flavors . having tried two of the pastas and the gnocchi , my impression is that these dishes are the food version of jazz improv - <unk> and overwhelming . like the music , i can see how the pasta bar dishes may appeal to
3 best outdoor eating area i 've seen in a long time ! with a patio like that , how can you go wrong ? it 's roomy and open yet cozy , and the partial shade is <unk> . i was there a few weeks ago on the last wonderfully
3 i love places that open before 7am . i 'm an early bird . showed up at scramble for the first time at <unk> this morning to be greated by clean modern decor , and a friendly staff . we tried the brizza -lrb- <unk> pizza -rrb- with bacon and
3 this farmers ' market is a little sparse in the summer months and rightfully so . there does not seem to an abundance of produce when it 's consistently 110 degrees outside . however , fall through spring is perfection and i love spending my saturday mornings here . wonderful
2 i think you could pretty easily compare this restaurant to an <unk> inn type establishment . it was similarly priced but the food was definitely better than your typical -lrb- cheaper -rrb- breakfast joint . we were seated right away but there seemed to be a pretty consistent wait in
3 i am happy to report that i was able to eat breakfast here recently and it was a great experience . our server was great and compared to other reviews , i felt the service was fairly quick . we were initially told that there was a ten minute wait
2 i 've only eaten here once but it was quite good . my husband and i both had the veggie burger and split an order of <unk> fries . it was plenty of food -lrb- the burgers are huge -rrb- and satisfying after an evening at ipic . it was
2 kona grill is good but a little overpriced . the exception to this rule is if you can get a table during happy hour . that 's a big `` if '' as there never seems to be enough seating and happy hour does not apply to the main restaurant
4 cornish pasty is ... wow . it 's almost <unk> . it 's really that good . first of all , any pub that has hoegaarden on draft is automatically a winner in my book . when you add that plus a great happy hour , life is good .
2 this review is a 2.5 rounded up to a 3 now . i 've been to this location a hand full of times . this review is heavily <unk> on my most recent experience . i came here last friday for a yelper uye to watch the kitchen <unk> <unk>
3 i 'm sure i ca n't add anything that has not been said about this place already . but given the fact that i love yelping , i got ta at least try ! walking into this establishment , you get the sense that you have walked into a hipster
2 ok , so this is my very first time going for a hike ... and echo canyon trail is the hike my friend chose to take me on . did i say she 's no longer my friend ? haha , just kidding , but no , really , i
4 i had decided that i was not giving in to the `` <unk> '' restaurants . i mean `` pig '' , `` pork '' and `` <unk> '' restaurants are popping up everywhere ! but i noticed that , no matter how hard i tried to ignore p &
2 nice people . i 'm not crazy about being served <unk> food that 's not `` slamming '' . it was just ok for me . i would go back for a group lunch or something , but the suggestion would not come from me .
4 this is a favorite `` staycation '' hotel for me . i stayed here on my 3rd trip to phoenix , just prior to moving into my home . i loved it then and i love it now . every since i moved here , i 've spent at least
3 a good place to take a break from the hustle and bustle of tempe marketplace . i 've tried a few of their teas -lrb- always iced -rrb- . i find them all incredibly refreshing , especially during the hot summer days . they brew each cup when you order
3 i really like the atmosphere of tuck shop . it is small , unassuming , and very homey . actually , it is so unassuming that i missed it on my first drive around . it would have helped if i was looking at the right side of the street
4 really good food in a cute setting ! i like how the restaurant is set up in little rooms . -lrb- it is a house after all ... -rrb- that makes for a more intimate , quieter meal . the omakase dinner was not available the night i went ,
4 holy sh * t ! * # ! @ !! * # ??? f ** k !!!! sorry , i 'm not prone to using <unk> , but that 's how upset i am that today was my first visit to stinkweeds . i have wasted countless hours surfing <unk>
4 a favorite spot for lunch on the weekends . you order up your food in a little farmhouse . pick from a selection of farm fresh sandwiches , salads , soups , and fresh baked goods . everything is very good . then grab a picnic table in the pecan
2 this <unk> pie cottage restaurant serves up high quality lunch fare at a reasonable price . it 's a great soup , salad , sandwich kind of place for ladies who lunch ... there 's the rub . the place is tiny and the wait is ridiculous , even if
3 it 's a dive but i swear this is the best grilled chicken sandwich i have ever had . we used to come here a couple times of week when i was in college . the bbq sauce is to die for . and it is so cheap .
3 i have to preface this review by <unk> that i rarely go to the grocery store so my opinion should be taken lightly . well , that 's not true . i do go to the grocery store on a regular basis to buy three items : wine , cheese
3 i have seen four peaks grow from a small bar to a full on restaurant over the years . good beer . good food . reasonable prices . what more can you ask for ? i reserved one star because it has lost a little something over the years for
4 noble beast has a fantastic selection of super premium pet food . it is one of the only places in town that sells evo by <unk> . i also discovered `` sam 's <unk> '' here , which my puppy absolutely loves . the staff is extremely knowledgable about pet
3 habitat of the rare <unk> . the coffee drinks are better than any other coffee shop i have found in phoenix . not as good as sf or portland ... but still pretty good . hipster scene aside , this is actually a very pleasant place to hang out .
2 i hate being the first person to review a restaurant when i have a below par experience , but here it goes ... the vig is a very cool space . if you are <unk> , you will be very exited to see how this non-descript brick <unk> has been
3 very good . cheap . too bad it is located in the seventh dimension of hell -lrb- aka chandler -rrb- . i would eat here every week if it was n't .
2 pretty good pasta . i would say 3.5 stars . there are other places in the area i prefer for italian , nevertheless , it is a cute restaurant with fresh seasonal pasta dishes . you ca n't go wrong here .
0 the food is not good . the scene is difficult to enjoy if you have progressed beyond the frat party stage of your life .
3 the spot for ladies who lunch ... need i say more ? upscale lunch . very nice soups , salads , and lunch entrees . lovely patio . loud and bustling , full of <unk> ladies in tennis attire . you might feel out of place if you do n't
3 went back and overall had a better experience : better food and much better service . relieved to see some improvements and think that they will start to build some regular and return customers . will be back with others to experience good thai and hope to see this place
3 in my book this place deserves between 4 and 4.5 stars . it 's all about the <unk> bread . a limited menu but focuses on great sandwiches with quality ingredients . ca n't go wrong with the classic tomato , mozz , and basil sandwich . delicious . only
2 finally , a place up in the n. scottsdale area where i would n't mind hanging out . why 'd it take so long for someone to figure out that there are n't any n. scottsdale places for those over 22 but not quite in the 40 + crowd ?
2 if you go expect the typical fox experience ; ie , the focus is more on the concept and atmosphere and not on the food ups : - kobe burger -lrb- add the smoked bacon -rrb- cooked as requested <unk> - nice bar with both indoor and outdoor seating -
3 downtown and it 's late but need a place for a bite and a drink ? hanny 's is a much needed welcome addition to the area . while the food is not bad go for the atmosphere and drinks . atypical from this <unk> town this is a good
3 good drinks . check . good selection of drinks including teas and smoothies . check . good ambience . check \ good service . double check great baked goods . double double check .
1 i really wanted to like this place . the people were friendly and the service was good , but the food was bland . pretty small and dark inside the bar area was practically <unk> . nevertheless , had to try the mojito . so-so and have had better .
3 ended up here randomly while looking for someplace new to eat . we ordered something involving a lion and a turkey something sandwich -- both were delicious ! staff was nice and they had homemade lemonade to boot . appetizers , salads , and desserts sounded tasty too -- will
2 came in for taco tuesday -- which seems like the most economical way to eat tacos here ! $ 1.50 per taco instead of close to $ 5 per taco . there are also daily specials . tried the grilled chicken , sweet pork , and raspberry chipotle chicken tacos
3 went with a group of about 15 last night after going rock climbing at phoenix rock gym . first time i 'd ever been to four peaks and had an enjoyable time ! we had a great server and my burger was amazing ! the poppin burger -lrb- i think
2 biscuits were to sweet for biscuits and gravy . my friend really liked the pancakes
3 prices can only be beat by costco . great selection
3 great service , fantastic food
4 one of the best meals i had in arizona ! we decided to sit outside as we went there on a wednesday and it was too quiet inside -lrb- but great design inside and we would try it next time ! -rrb- . we heard good things and were looking
4 one of the best restaurant in town . i have been there few times and they really manage to wow me every time ! the owner if nice and friendly and is really on top of things . the service is great and the food is amazing ! we are
3 great spot for a casual drink in old town . love the patio and the big round bar . most bartenders pour weak drinks but overall great spot !
2 great for <unk> ball soup and hanging with the <unk> crowd ! bad for their grilled cheese : -lrb-
4 since today i hiked camelback -lrb- the echo canyon side -rrb- for the first time of the `` season '' , i thought i 'd review it . and how out of shape do i feel now ! i used to hike camelback 2-3 times a week until i hurt
3 so the long awaited w has finally opened its doors and so too has sushi roku ! my `` date '' and i stroll in monday evening and because it had just opened 3 days earlier i was expecting it to be much more crowded then it was . but
3 i like going here - there is plenty of choice - good burgers , love their pot pie and they do a good brunch on the <unk> . if you are not sure what you want for dinner , come here there is plenty of variety and you will not
3 never disappoints - love their salad with honey mustard and then their sinful sunday . filet is what i get here . always get good service and never really have to wait for a table at this location .
3 went for breakfast on a saturday - loved the atmosphere out on the terrace . enjoyed a more healthy version of breakfast - my feta omelet was excellent . food came out very quickly and service was good , although our iced tea did run dry once , otherwise they
4 went to mastro 's last night and did a complete repeat of our last dinner there . the food was outstanding yet again ... the mac and cheese was even better this time which i did n't think was possible . at one point the lounge singers became too loud
4 still loving this place ! if you like yogurt and granola , try theirs it 's exceptional . blt 's are great too -lrb- fyi , they put a fried egg on their blt -rrb- .
2 i 've been to true food a bunch of times but i still ca n't make up my mind as to how much i like it . the food is consistently good , kale salad is awesome , tacos , pizza , soup are all good and i love that
3 we moved here from northern nj where a ny style deli is <unk> right along with any big religion yet in our last few years there , all the great ny style delis by us were closing in rapid <unk> . going into nyc just was n't an option each
4 i love this store . the produce is always fresh , they have an interesting selection of frozen items including some great appetizers , the meat department is outstanding - i 've tried a few different kabobs from here -lrb- spicy kabob rocks -rrb- , bakery is great , nice
4 i have n't had any baked goods , but the drinks are awesome and the decor is really fun . they have a frequent buyer program !
4 everything here is tasty . they can be crowded , so expect that ! wish they were open later when my friends want to go boozing and i want an espresso !
1 i always try to support my <unk> business chains , but i 'd rather eat somewhere else . i 've tried pita jungle twice , and i was dissapointed both times . the menu is huge , and all of the options sound especially appealing . however , most of
3 very trendy spot in arcadia . had always heard about this place and finally decided to go since i was in the area . the patio is awesome i love all the trees ! great happy hour too if you get there before 6 !
4 a trendy wine <unk> in old town scottsdale that celebrates local . have never had a bad meal or experience at fnb .
3 a great place to grab a beer in downtown . i 've never had the food but i do enjoy a pint at the bar whenever i 'm walking down in the area .
2 if you have to pay to take a piss you already lose a star in my book .

3 i went here recently with my asian friends for chinese new year for our yearly tradition of <unk> . i really had a very nice time . the food and tea came at regular <unk> and i do n't think i stopped eating the 2 hours i was there .
3 this restuarant is inside the beautiful <unk> montelucia resort & spa . driving up towards the hotel and restaurant has breathtaking views and once inside the awesome ambience and decor continues . food is good though not the best i have ever eaten . me and a group of friends

3 hmmm ... fun ! sporadic !! energetic !? none of the above . but - lovely quiet property . really good food altho the <unk> went off only for the tiramisu . genius . i 'm a total tiramisu snot ball so if it stinks i do n't want it
4 honestly one of the best lattes i 've had . what great people that really care about doing things right .
4 not much needs to be said . they do it right . from the service to the food all was perfect and made for a very enjoyable night !
4 love the ambiance here , and it does n't get any better . do n't bother sitting inside ; the outside is the place to be . grab a few beers , get the club sandwhich that has chicken , bacon , and ham and enjoy ! we use to
3 we 've been going here for years , and we went again last night . this is the hands down best place to get chicken shwarma in the valley . my friends turned me on to cafe istanbul a few years ago and even though they moved away long ago
2 i am still out on this one . i 'd love to give it 21/2 . yes , there are lots of flies and they need to do something about it -lrb- upside down 2 <unk> bottles with sugar water ? -rrb- . it 's annoying but i like the

4 i was lucky enough to have a <unk> friend invite me to a preview lunch at seasons 52 . i was very impressed by the service , the quality of the food and the decor in the restaurant . what really makes seasons stand out though were the desserts .
4 classic hike . in the center of the city with views of all the familiar spots in the east and west valley . it 's a challenging hike , especially if you have never hiked before . it 's easily one of the best parts about living in phoenix .
3 for one dollar more , you can experience a whole other world of burger . here are some of my tips for the 6 dollar burger meal -lrb- you still get a boatload of fries and a drink -rrb- : sonoma style which comes with a creamy pesto sauce and
1 i happened on boulders after four peaks was mysteriously closed . i have n't been this underwhelmed in a while . as far as the interior of boulders , there was much to like : a bar area , a restaurant area , a second floor with pool table ,
4 i love that i have a slice of mexico in walking distance from my apartment . i always get the exact same thing at la tolteca . chicken enchiladas with rice and beans . green sauce . no lettuce . with a side of the tomatillo salsa . i should
4 i had been wanting to check out short leash dogs for quite some time after hearing lots of buzz on yelp and on phoenix new times . a trip to the urban grocery store for some wine tasting yesterday provided a perfect opportunity . there were four specialty dogs up
3 my bosses have brought in late afternoon snacks of humble pie a few times now and i 've enjoyed it all ! i 've never stepped foot in here , nor noticed whilst driving through scottsdale , so clearly i wo n't speak to parking , service , atmosphere .
2 lovely local ice cream purveyor in central phoenix . parking is tight and the space is a bit cramped but the product is spot on , as it were . a group of us stopped in one sunday afternoon and bought at least 8 pints of ice cream . i
3 yay for bomberos 's anniversary event ! i stopped by last night , meeting up with the party christina p organized around 6pm . all of the hostesses and servers were really friendly and personable and i found the yelpers quickly . the outdoor patio is just delicious ; stone

2 pizza in my mouth hole ! okay i should probably start off with a classier intro , but let 's get real and put some cibo pizza in there all ready . cibo was lucky enough to set the stage for andrea k 's birthday on saturday night and i
2 i 'm so glad i got a scottsdale <unk> card and that this location is so close to where i work . i 'm a phoenix <unk> user and the difference between the two <unk> is glaring and a little sad . anyway , <unk> allows you to put as
2 i came here on a wednesday midday to see milk . i 'm glad this place is n't playing the standard selection of cheap and annoying <unk> that seem to be <unk> other theatres . yes i 'm talking to you paul <unk> , mall cop . ugh . in
4 this was goodness . we ordered the mozzarella cheese plate as an appetizer , which was really good . i asked our server what plates he recommended , and he said that if he went once in his life to the restaurant , he would eat either the meatloaf or
2 good sandwiches and good bread . gives me a panera feeling , but with definitely better quality and taste . tried subsequently the nine grain bagel , and that was really good .
3 great torta nortena . my gf told me about the place , as she saw it on man v food as well . i was in that area and decided to stop . the nortena has steak , chipotle mayo , cheese , avocado , grilled onion and do n't
3 brio tuscan grille is a chain of formula restaurants serving northern italian inspired food , much like <unk> 's little italy is a chain that serves more southern italian inspired food . it has about 30 locations and is hq in ohio . there is another one in gilbert ,
4 well , hate to join the bandwagon , but this place is the real deal ! i went here based on yelp reviews , which after almost a dozen , averaged 5 stars ! but several were from newbies to sushi , so i was skeptical , even with a
4 love love love this place !!! from the decor to the delicious <unk> of local food , this is a place that i highly recommend to everyone ! the funghi pizza is heaven . goat cheese , mushrooms and truffle oil !? yes ! we often come here for a
4 i really do enjoy this bar . they have a great jukebox , pool table and tasty <unk> . on one of my more memorable trips to shady 's i started with and irish coffee ... not wanting to get all <unk> up on caffeine , i asked if the
4 have been here twice now , and both times my tastebuds were tickled with delight . they serve breakfast until 4pm , which is a gift from above , as i love me some <unk> in the afternoon . i ordered the roasted turkey omelette , sans turkey and instead
3 this cute little neighborhood breakfast/lunch spot just opened up , and is the sister restaurant to tuck shop . the menu is small with super reasonable prices !! not much in the way of vegan fare , but i managed to find a tasty dish : the red flannel hash
4 ok , so i have stopped in twice now , and both times were quite nice . the first time i just had a scoop of their <unk> vanilla ice cream with some salted caramel on top . it was good , but the caramel was super salty ... a
4 oh ... my ... <unk> ! i ca n't believe i have n't visited this little gem sooner ! it 's nestled atop a pei wei and starbucks so i was n't sure what to expect . but from the moment i walked up the dimly light <unk> and into
4 while i do n't really buy a whole lot from here , i love walking the aisles of bulk goods . they are very reasonably priced , especially when it comes to food . a huge bag of spinach for three bucks ?! a large container of organic raspberries for
0 it 's true ... i have experienced better , much better . i really want to like this place , but both times i 've eaten here i have been unimpressed . i ordered a veggie burrito with a side of fruit and some salsa . ugh , first off
2 it 's friday ... i ran this morning ... i 'm running a half marathon on saturday ... damn it ! i can have a donut , or two . i 've been smelling bosa a few times a week on runs and finally i decided i could stop <unk>
3 4.5 stars ... and at least 10 <unk> . ahh , nothing like a hip campus joint to make me regret the fact that i have to shave on a regular basis . fortunately , my longing to <unk> my <unk> was distracted by the great coffee . the space
1 <unk> - 2 stars <unk> - a hoof of approval <unk> - ok , <unk> i was excited at the idea of a <unk> with good food ... but let 's face it , food is an afterthought at best here , which is a shame , because the food
4 this is my favorite restaurant in the phoenix area . there , i wrote it ... and i am sticking to it . first off -- fresh local , sustainable , organic are not just words on the menu and the website . now , in places like san francisco
2 4 - stars for the salad bar , beer and wine selection , and decent sushi , but i am deducting a star because i have to walk through the baked goods to get my salad and squeeze by the tennis moms lunching . ok , the last one not
3 i come here to feel young and it works ... but often i leave , or <unk> , feeling old . that 's what great beer , much better than average bar food , and a young staff who think of you as that funny -lrb- and hopefully not creepy
1 the clothes are awesome . the prices are awesome . so why 2 stars ? customer service . obviously all the employees are there to get a discount on already cheap clothes because they do n't acknowledge you . there 's attitude when you ask for a dressing room .
4 they offer weekend brunch now !!!! donut holes , eggs benedict , biscuits and gravy . life at the windsor is lovely .
2 it seems they spent all of their money making the restaurant look great so could n't spend anything on making the food great . do n't get me wrong ... the food was n't bad . it just was n't great . there is n't anything that i thought ,
4 i wish we had more people with us so that there was a reason to order everything on the menu . my coworker called me up and said let 's go to lunch . she asked me what i was in the mood for and said i had n't been
4 i came back for my birthday . in order to celebrate in true <unk> fashion , we ordered pretty much everything on the menu . i 'm not exaggerating here . everything was good . everything . you seriously can not go wrong with anything on the menu and i
2 this placed <unk> me . my meal was tasty and good enough to start my day . nothing above or below good enough . i only saw one table drinking coffee around me . on a cold day , that can only mean your coffee sucks . so i opted
2 fun place for wings and drinks . lots of great sauces . this place will do a sauce tasting for you , which is pretty awesome . my favorite <unk> rubs : desert heat -lrb- also good on <unk> chips -rrb- mango habenero honey bbq hot
3 fun place to go to late at night when you 're in need of delicious food . their hours are <unk> , making it a great place for a late night snack . every time i 've gone they 've run out of some ingredients , which is disappointing but
3 delicious , inexpensive , fluffy donuts !
3 be ready for very casual , cafeteria style dining . no need to dress to impress , although i have seen multiple groups of people in evening attire at this restaurant . i think they must go for the great food regardless of being over dressed . favorites : beef
4 what happens when a great atmosphere , great service and great food <unk> ? well , you have to be at windsor . if i have a free evening and want to go out to an enjoyable meal in a relaxed atmosphere we just hop over to windsor and enjoy
0 after a long morning of volunteering at a local animal <unk> my coworkers and i sat down at the famous -lrb- infamous -rrb- los dos molinos for a filling lunch . i know 10 people at lunch is a challenge , but the place was empty and we were treated
4 this is definitely one of phoenix 's dirty little secrets ! an amazing pizza place in the middle of town . there are other `` big '' names in the area , but in my opinion the biggest name of them all is pino 's . this place is absolutely
3 we came here before a <unk> game for a drink . the staff was very nice and the fresh cocktails were tasty !
2 stay very friendly . the food was just ok - if you 're in the area and are looking for a quick lunch i would recommend .
3 i will definitely be back . our service was off - appetizer ordered did n't make it in , as well as one of the entrees . someone came over and offered to take the appetizer off the bill which we thought was very nice . however , when we
2 well right when we got here , we were treated to a line that was four couples deep , room enough for three . i figured i 'd spend a little time answering email , but their wifi was locked down . the hostess asked manager `` lee '' for
3 yes , there 's one realistic review of <unk> here , then the wide ranging ones , so i 'll just tell you some of my deals : men 's <unk> jeans with the original labels : $ 30 -lrb- $ <unk> <unk> -rrb- ; new <unk> slip <unk> $
4 move over matt 's ... new menus , dog friendly patio and wonderful caramel french toast , fresh bacon for the pooch makes this the best all-around early eatery for the valley !
4 my wife and i ate here last night . they had a special going ; a 3 course dinner for 50 $ , and we both opted for it . the place is very well designed , and very tranquil with fountains , and flowers . its like you stepped
3 hands down the best cheesesteak in town , period . even the two east coast guys i went with said it was as close as they had gotten from home . that says a lot coming from these <unk> i was out with for lunch today ...
4 this has to be one of the very best sandwich places to hit up for lunch in downtown phoenix ! if you havent tried this place you have got to give yourself some time and come on down ! there was a group of us the other day for lunch
4 do you fancy yourself a music snob ? then this is the place for you ! if you can find it at target , you probably wo n't find it here , which is why i love it . within the confines of the four tiny walls lies a treasure
3 this place is great . the people are nice , the coffee is so good , and the free wi-fi is definitely a bonus . my only complaint ? that it is n't in my neighborhood . that said , i go to copper star for the coffee . i
4 i 've found a new grocery shopping destination ... and i think i may be in love . sure , i do n't know what half of the items on the shelves are used for , and i do n't really care for dates , but there is just so
0 mucho gusto es mucho <unk> . let me say first , that the place is cute , the staff is friendly , and the salsa is good . there . i 'm not being a total jerk . the food , however , left much to be desired . i
2 the food is decent , but a word of advice . never sit outside if you see ducks out there . case and point - i met my ex there for lunch . the ducks were very active about leaving their <unk> on the porch area where we were sitting
4 been here a couple of times , food is always great , service is always great . what more can i say ? eat here . i would say try a specific item , but honestly i have n't had one yet that was bad .
3 i have attempted to go to oregano 's 5 times . i have actually eaten here 3 times . the food was good , the parking is terrible . i would be able to give this place 5 stars if i didnt have to fight for parking and a table
2 well at least they do n't use crappy cup o ' noodles right ? i got my ramen to go , i do n't know if that <unk> my quality ? anyways lets get down to business ... i got the republic ramen , its named after the place it
2 went to brio for a nice dinner . it had great service -lrb- as to be expected -rrb- . server knew his `` <unk> '' well , but did n't know much else about the dishes . i ordered the shrimp <unk> and my girlfriend ordered the sweet potato something
3 second time i came in , food is pretty expensive , but its well worth it . i do recommend getting the bruschetta , you pick 4 different ones -lrb- which are cut into nice 4 slices each -rrb- . we got the salmon , roasted peppers , tomato jam
2 so this place i would rank in the same exact field as spinatos . this is a tough category to be in . not quite sure what they were going for with the decor . there <unk> tv 's everywhere -lrb- in the <unk> -rrb- section of the place .
2 revolving sushi is supposed to be cheap and not the best quality . so i give you a 3 star , i have had better conveyor belt style sushi before . it is nice to have one of these close to where you live . good for eating on a
3 i ca n't decide ... 3 or 4 stars ??? service is probably what is going to push it up to four . this place has the best thai tea that i 've had up north . this is what sets it apart for me . their spice is a
3 mmmm delicious . had the <unk> lamb burger . i love how it was n't purely ground , but more like pulled lamb ? not sure if that is how lamb comes out when it is ground or if it really was . anyways this burger was amazing . perfectly
3 i had a pork dish when i was here . it was pretty good . the wait here was long . definitely make reservations next time we come . the nachos we had as an appetizer was large , we split it between 7 people -lrb- remember an appetizer not
2 food is ehh here . but the games are fun if you come with a few friends . drinks are never consistent , one day they will be pure sugar and the next it will be the best pours ever . . but you have to expect that going into
4 i used to come here all the time during high school . inexpensive food , great greasy burgers , the fries here are delicious ! they have many different flavors of milkshakes , i usually get the butterscotch . no restrooms , limited seating space , i recommend getting your
4 this place seriously does have the best pie in the entire world . drive up and bring a few to take home . try the mixed berry crumble , it 's incredibly delicious .
3 very good food
4 best horchata ever ! the tacos and salsa were also some of the best i have ever had . try the mole taco .
4 great service and amazing food . maximum calories per dollar . just awesome !
2 i think that when you wait so long to eat the food , the anticipation itself and your increased hunger leads you to believe that this is the greatest pizza on earth . the pizza maker was a bit irritated that i asked him not to burn the crust .
4 a packed restaurant in the middle of the afternoon , now i know why . they have great food , good prices and beer that does n't give you a headache . the wait staff was very nice , attentive , young girls with new breast <unk> -lrb- why do
4 third time is definitely a charm . first time : i had a gift certificate , tried the panini and an awesome selection of red wine i ca n't remember . after hearing so many great things about postino , i was quite disappointed that night . my panini was
2 i drove by this restaurant last week and remember thinking `` wow , that font style is very fox <unk> ! '' <unk> , i was n't wrong ! my friend and i had dinner here on saturday night for her <unk> farewell . we were told by the hostess
3 amazing customer service and sushi . mediocre robata items . i had the best birthday dinner here about 3 weeks ago . the couple who brought me here had been here 2 other times , so i knew i was in for a treat . we sat at the <unk>
2 let me preface this review by saying that i am not a coffee person . i would like to be a coffee person , but whenever i drink coffee i experience unfortunate side effects like running as fast as i can and spinning around in <unk> chairs . so when
3 coming from the flagstaff bookman 's , i always think , whoa ! this place is huge ! they have a large selection of everything , and i usually spend a lot of time in the travel section , fiction , <unk> , <unk> , and records . i am
3 i 'm a fan of sandwiches ... and not plain sandwiches , neither . i want all the fixins , unexpected toppings , and bread options you have to offer ! sacks delivers in these essential categories . first , they have two killer vegetarian options . the <unk> has
3 i have always loved the phoenix art museum and remember seeing many exhibits there on class field trips ! i guess i 'm a grown up now , but i still like to go when they put something new up . right now the front hallway is covered in black
4 so cute and it fits right in with its vintage , funky neighborhood , being a <unk> gas station and all . they have a small seating area inside and a nice patio as well . the coffee was good and there is a big selection of <unk> and sons
4 the only negative thing i could possibly say about this spinato 's is that it 's just too far from my office . any time i want to eat there for lunch , i have to get take out and come eat it at my desk . and let me
4 i was very happy with my visit to perk . recently , one of my co-workers came in to work raving about the breakfast he had at perk , insisting i try them out as well . well i figure , who am i turn down such an endorsement ?
4 i had intended to give this sandwich place four stars - because it seemed excessive to give any sandwich place five stars -- but hey , on reflection what could they do better to get that extra star ? nothing - so five stars it is . really big inventive
2 chinese buffets are gross things . there 's a reason they 're cheap , folks . so - <unk> on a curve - this is one of the best . note that i 'm not saying it has great chinese food , i 'm saying by the <unk> standards of
1 a group of us decided to meet up and hang out for st. patrick 's day and zipps was a convenient place for all of us to go . it was surprisingly slow for the day but it worked out well for us because that meant lots of tables open
4 the original plan was n't actually to go to stingray tonight but i 'm soooo happy we ended up here ! bestie and i decided to do dinner once she got off work at dry bar and we were going to go to true foods but there was a 35
3 oh chipotle , what 's not to love honestly ? great quality ingredients that you can have thrown together in a completely <unk> meal , it 's hard to go wrong with that set up . i managed to stop in at a rare time when they did n't have
4 a friend took me here for our weekly lunch and it was a really cool dining experience . it 's very no fuss , it 's set up like a fast food place , you look at the menu on the wall then order from the person behind the window
3 some friends and i decided to meet up for happy hour and la bocca won our pick for new place to try out . i was happy that there was parking basically right behind it so that i did n't have to walk too far from my car -lrb- you
2 i was with a large group of people for a friend 's going away party and they had decided on cadillac ranch as the venue . i arrived a little bit later than everyone else so they had already ordered food and several rounds of drinks . i was worried
2 ever watch those cooking reality shows and think `` holy crap , that chef is waaaaaay too sweaty to be in a kitchen ? '' yeah , that was totally my waiter . when he was n't hovering over me with <unk> of rain , we were treated to <unk>
3 i have n't been to z ` tejas in years . so when a date asked if i wanted to meet there , i thought what a great idea , now i 'll totally have something to yelp about ! we met at 6 pm on a saturday night ,

3 love , love , love the beer selection ! i also really appreciate the fact that they take the time to create a beer menu with so much more detail than just the name . you can see what style , the brewer and even the alcohol content of each
3 i love lee lees - i can spend hours wandering around the aisles just looking at all the interesting things they have . think of a type of food , you can find it here - from chinese and korean specialties to <unk> and indian . i love to cook
3 i love to read . i mean i really love to read , about a book a day on average . with that in mind , books are not cheap , and i love `` recycling '' them to save money and paper . changing hands offers a wide variety
4 stopped by here on a saturday night for dinner with friends ... and ended up staying like 4 hours ! we ordered drinks , hookah , and dinner menu items . the food was delicious , and the homemade pita bread was outstanding . the hookah was delicious ... but
3 love the food make reservations , it gets busy . no matter how many times i come here , i still can never find it ... old town scottsdale is like my <unk> triangle ... i especially like the sweet and savory desserts that they carry ... bleu cheese cheesecake
4 oh how i love thee armadillo grill through the years , i still love . love love love love their food ! i order their seared tuna salad without noodles and with the dressing on the side . yum . i love their armadillo gold sauce on the chicken sliders

2 the service was pretty awesome . the food was very meh in my opinion . i got the restaurant week menu and ordered : lobster bisque steak and lobster tail chocolate <unk> cake i enjoyed everything but the steak and lobster . the <unk> was worse than anything you 'd
2 it was good . but the menu was very limited , and while i can appreciate a small menu ... this one just did n't have much that i was interested in . so i ended up ordering the bacon sandwich , which was delicious ... but . it 's
4 <unk> i love this place my boyfriend who hates sweets even loves this place salted butter caramel ... yum . honey yogurt ... nonfat ... yum i love it .
2 only go here for happy hour . period . seriously overpriced if you do n't go for happy hour . luckily , happy hour <unk> seven days a week . both a normal and reverse happy hour . do n't go crazy . this place does n't have the best
2 3 stars = a-ok red miso soup was lukewarm , ehhhh , whatever salmon nigiri cuts were subpar - no equal <unk> of fat lines ... but still tender ! though i would have preferred the <unk> ... toro was excellent ! rolls were good , but the rice was
4 5 stars for the best nachos on this planet . the red pepper queso sauce on them , magical . love that the chicken on the nachos is shaved thinly ... so perfectly compliment the chips . love !
2 ok . i was expecting to be wowed by this place . i wanted to be wowed ! but , i was n't . came here for restaurant week , and we all ordered off of the restaurant week menu . there were n't any options , at all really
2 i found the crepes to hit the spot on a lazy hungover sunday morning ... i had the bacon , egg and cheese crepe with cheddar cheese . i would have to say it was a bit average , and would have enjoyed maybe some sort of creamy sauce on

1 just not a fan i went last week , they had some new menu items i got the buffalo chicken pizza eh i 'd rather go to <unk> , or nypd . although , i have so many friends who love this place . i just do n't get it
4 the best bar in phoenix . the bikini girls have experience . i 've had some of the best nights up in that bitch . sexy . and pbr is like so cheap . do n't be <unk> when you see all the dudes drinking straight from a personal pitcher
2 big picture : sub-par awful decor -lrb- cheap ikea -rrb- and even worse music -lrb- taylor <unk> techno remix -rrb- food : everything i 've ever had here was really good . including the `` go green '' martini that the waitress insisted i would not like ... weird .
2 <unk> ! <unk> . i 've been back quite a few times . let 's see . service is hit or miss ... when it 's on it is donkey kong ! ca n't remember the guys name , but one night the service was <unk> / phoenix ! why

3 note : this review is for happy hour only . my husband and i sat on their front patio for happy hour . we ordered the guacamole , which was good but overpriced for happy hour , and then green chili pork , which was so worth every penny --
2 ajo al 's is just ok , its nothing fancy or different from any other mexican restaurant . the queso dip is amazing , the <unk> pollo con queso is pretty good , be warned though , it is overly stuffed with dried chicken , and some of the chicken
4 tryst cafe is the best thing to arrive at desert ridge . food is amazing , i 'm craving more ! atmosphere is perfect , servers are friendly ... check it out !!!

2 i have to say that i 've given this place three tries . i finally got served and had a chance to taste the food , and i am writing this review after three attempts . the first time i came here , i was confused by the many entrances
2 always impressed ! the olive plate is a great starter . or the feta cheese plate . my favorite entre is the <unk> , which is vegetarian . the vegetables served on the side are flavored with a little lemon , which is so nice . mmm ! i also
2 i enjoy the sushi and the atmosphere at kona grill . the pizza 's pretty good too , despite its <unk> style . i really like the fish tanks and the indoor/outdoor area . a wonderful <unk> .
4 hands down best grilled chicken place in the phoenix area . only takes cash so be sure to bring some . their carne is awesome as well . if its your first time there try both meats . menu options are limited but hey who needs more ? i 'm
2 went only once for lunch with a groupon . i tried two different food dishes -lrb- macaroni with cheese , and beet ravioli -rrb- . both of the dishes were pretty good . the service was ok and the prices were a bit on the high side . overall i
3 the food is good and they give generous portions . the interior is nicely furnished and has several pictures and items from ethiopia . their wine <unk> looks good but i have only been here for lunch . you ca n't go wrong with any of their combo dishes .
2 i 'm really surprised this place is n't out of business yet . its never busy and i always come in with a coupon and buy a lot of `` manager special items '' overall the item selection , quality , and price are ok . my favorite part is
2 the food here is good for the price but just ok when you consider other thai places in the area like thai elephant . its an asu favorite and their curries are the way 2 go . i recommend at least trying this place and forming your own opinion .
0 this is an update from my previous review . had to attend a business lunch last week and thought `` oh no '' when i found out zinc bistro was the chosen destination . there were ten people in our party we sat outside in the back garden patio area
3 went here for lunch today upon recommendation of acquaintances . my first impression of the atmosphere was this place is very `` long . '' by that i mean the restaurant is in the shape of a bowling alley . the restaurant is one long dark hallway with booths on
1 i 'm not sure what all the hype is regarding this place , i 've had much better . my husband and i had heard wonderful things about oregano 's throughout the years -lrb- we 've lived in phoenix 22 years -rrb- and decided we had to finally try oregano
2 went here for lunch recently while in the area . i 've heard so many good things about durant 's that i thought i better check it out . i 've lived in phoenix over 22 years and have never been to this landmark phoenix steakhouse . the food was
4 cool place to see bands , never a cover , but there might be for the show on <unk> 2 ? 21 + over only , kids ! do n't even try . yeah i 'm talking to you , baby face <unk> . it can get rowdy in front
2 my friend invited me for lunch with friends since i know my new mexican food and amazingly , i have n't been here yet after a decade in the valley . i judge every new mexican restaurant by their carne adovada , the signature dish of northern new mexico besides
2 went there last night late for a chile relleno burrito . i craved one and i have n't had theirs yet . it was delicious and had refried beans . i could taste the relleno batter which mixed with the other ingredients well , but there should 've been more
4 outstanding . . unpretentious . . and down right perfect customer service ! this place is unbelievable ! the smoked salmon is the best i have ever had ! the rolls are delicious and the nigiri sashimi is perfect as are the sushi chefs ! did i mention the smoked
4 one of thee most relevant new mexican restaurants outside the state of new mexico . ldm is on par with la <unk> in las <unk> and rancho de chimayo outside <unk> fe . we quickly settled in on a <unk> chimi smothered <unk> red & green -lrb- known as christmas
4 i used to be a pc guy cause i thought apple products were way over priced compared to other products . somehow i converted . started out with an imac which grew to getting my kids <unk> . same computers with no issues . no bugs . amazing . anyways
2 i have n't been to this place in ages so we decided to try this place again . it has n't changed very much . still has a huge menu with large portions . i had the cajun jambalaya pasta . it was very spicy with really tender chicken over
4 i 've really wanted to try this place and today was my lucky day . the outside is so unassuming and a shopping center that i probably would never go to except for pvbc . anyways , we walked in and i was n't expecting too much on the inside
4 we decided to try this small place . was very surprised . great food . friendly service . i had the lamb and chicken and it was very tender . my son is picky eater and he loved the beef kebab . the potato cakes were excellent . we will
3 we were walking around tempe marketplace and really did n't know where we wanted to eat until my wife started to smell the bbq . so we decided on lucille 's . i 've been here quite a few times but never wrote a review . the place is decorated
2 conveniently located in scottsdale quarter . this place is always packed especially on weekends . sitting by a stop light on scottsdale rd , you can see people lining up to get in . place is surrounded with mostly an older crowd & some mid 30s in there business suit
4 wow . not what i expected . i usually go to four peaks but decided to try something different . on a monday night i decided to see what other yelpers suggested ... we decided to go here . walked in and was about to turn around . not much
3 went here with a friend and got some of the best service in town . lucy was our waitress and she was on the ball , cheery and attentive . we both had great sandwiches and they even have gluten free rolls . ca n't eat the desserts but boy
1 okay , i am confused ... one day i get the best deal in town another day the prices are higher than aj 's . i purchased green and yellow squash and it was $ <unk> per pound more than any other grocery i shop and not a sale any
4 one of the gems in phoenix .
0 i ordered the nachos which is just a huge try of fried <unk> with cheese , pepperoni and some type of meat . that tasted interesting but it was a huge tray for $ 10.00 . my friends ordered a sausage pizza which had hot dog meat for sausage .
3 another one visit review ... well i 'm not sure when i will get back and i really liked this place so i will give them a shout out . if you close your eyes and picture a vegetarian restaurant it 's pretty much exactly like that . the best
3 this place does n't look like much from the outside it 's one of the couple of restaurants that have been converted over in phoenix from existing buildings , but that should n't deter you from stopping by . the inside is completely renovated and has an updated and friendly
3 stopped by for lunch the other day and i can say i was pretty impressed . it 's kind of hard to spot since it 's in the corner of a very small and crowded parking lot , but do n't let that deter you . i liked the decor
4 i ate here the other day and thought it was great , i will definitely be going back . from the other reviews maybe i 'm biased since i 'm a guy . i had a chicken pita and tried my friends gyro and thought they were both very good
2 been here a few times for lunch and a few times for dinner . the pizza has always good , not great , but the service is always kind of slow . so do n't go if you are in a hurry . i appreciate the fact everything is organic
3 excellent place to see live music . this place is in a great location . easy walking distance from other stuff downtown . the bouncers have always been very friendly with us on our visits . the staff at the door and bar have been cool . it 's a
2 i guess i am in the minority . i 'm not a huge fan of this place in the two times i have been here . the servers are okay , but they seem to just whisk in and out without really <unk> you very much or smiling . i
3 excellent coffee drinks . i got my mocha to go and they even took the time to make the cool foam design on it even though it was soon covered by the to-go top . very friendly staff and i was in and out in a flash . what more
3 nice to have a closer pita jungle . this location is missing the pond they have at the other location past the 101 on ray road , but it has a much bigger patio which is always a good thing . the inside of the restaurant is pretty big and
3 according to the <unk> website the <unk> <unk> reference to tofu is in the poem ode to tofu , written at the end of the 15th century , in <unk> ad . well , a bit over 500 years later , i have to say that my experience at chodang
4 well , i had not gone to la bocca in some time -lrb- at least all summer -rrb- and wow , what a <unk> surprise this thursday evening . the establishment , if anything , continues to get better , and not just the food . going into la bocca
3 in the interest of full disclosure the only thing i every really go here for is the lunch buffet but wow , what a great buffet ! i believe the buffet itself is about $ 10 and for that you get a wide range of vegetarian items and as with
3 i initially thought it was good but maybe not great when i first tried it but found myself going back and trying the pork instead of the beef and that is when i connected with this place . they cook the pork in a one of those rotating gyro meat
3 i 've only eaten in the restaurant part of this place once several years ago but was looking to buy black <unk> to use in making this home-made hard liquor based hot sauce that i read about in the <unk> 2011 edition of <unk> magazine -lrb- number 25 of the
2 i had already got a bit of a nosh at casey moore 's before i decided to go and check out dave 's electric brew when i have been waiting to open like . . forever you know dude ? -lrb- thus ends my valley girl impression -rrb- . they
4 this is one of the best bookstores i have ever visited in arizona . great selection of books , gifts , great book signings , overall worth the stop !
4 pita jungle has the best hummus i have ever tried ! my favorite thing to get is the hummus and tabouli , its a meal itself ! also , <unk> con ajo is delicious and savory , with carrot chips ! luckily there are more than 1 around now ,
4 truly a gem for phoenix ! worth the drive wherever you live in the phoenix area . the oils they produce , on site , will change your cooking ! white truffle oil , roasted garlic oil , its made an impact to how we cook in our home .
3 let me first explain that we came to the place on a bad night ... apparently , one of their regulars literally drank herself to death - spent a week in the hospital before <unk> finally died . instead of a funeral , her husband and family set up a
2 eh ... look , i really like the concept that mixes asian and mexican ... . i mean ... where else can you get <unk> with carnitas , spicy salsa and a <unk> , right ? ca n't knock the food at all ! that said ... you can generally
3 well had i known fibber <unk> was the same ownership group as the skeptical chymist , i might not have approached it with so much <unk> -lrb- the <unk> is one of my favorite irish pubs in the valley -rrb- ... . but you fellow yelpers can be glad i
2 back in town for a bit , my wife and i dragged my parents out to dinner . north mountain brewing co. was on my bookmarks -lrb- listed as a microbrewery and gastropub -rrb- ... so we thought we 'd give it a shot . walking in , i was
2 <unk> of reviews for this place ... and most of them just overflowing with praises ... ... . but ... . eh ... . . it was okay ... . please first understand that there is almost nothing irish about this place , apart from the decor . few irish
2 i had about a half hour before i had to get <unk> the downtown area ... so i swung in here to check the place out ! it 's not a bad place at all ... and does a decent job at trying to be irish -lrb- though i think
2 i 've got ta go with the crowd here ... just decent beer , decent service , decent food ... ... absolutely nothing special about the place at all . in a city full of microbrew restaurants , this one 's not anywhere near the top of the list .
1 i feel like i 'm in the minority , but i was n't really wowed by this place . a small group of coworkers wanted mexican for dinner , this was near our office so here we went . you have to valet your car which is kind of annoying
3 i work around the corner from this theater and like others , did n't even know it was here . there is n't much to say about a theater , but the staff we <unk> with were nice and the theater was clean . we did n't take a look
3 after margaret cho , me and my crew went over to amsterdam , and it being my first time , i was super excited because i had heard a lot about it . we got there around 10pm and it was n't super packed , which was nice since i
2 a friend and i had dinner here over the weekend before catching a show at gammage . we were debating between this and thirsty lion , but i wanted to eat light and indulge in the salad bar so we decided on <unk> . we walked in and it was
2 we took advantage of the free museum entry at the sunday a ` fair event . it 's definitely interesting , but you can knock out the whole place in under an hour . the exhibits on our visit were interesting . i ca n't say that i 'd run
3 finally made it to cpc for dinner last night . one of our friends is moving out of town so we headed over for drinks and dinner and took over one of the large tables inside . it took awhile for our whole party to arrive , but our server
3 i had heard about this place quite often on yelp , and since i had today off of work , i grabbed some friends and we went down to dtphx for dinner . we arrived around 6pm and saw that the bar was happenin ' with the happy hour crowd
2 i really wanted street tacos and i did n't think that i had been to los favoritos before so i stopped here on my way home a few nights ago . i walked in and the person at the counter was taking a call so i patiently waited for a
3 i 've been to the scottsdale location and to this one a few times , but i guess i never reviewed this one <unk> anyways , one of my hometown friends drove in from san diego and displeased with his roscoe 's experience , was dying to go to lolo
2 i went here last night for dinner with two of my friends . it was my first time and was n't really sure what to expect . well , the place was really clean and although it was pretty packed , we were seated immediately in the dining area .
2 stopped by for lunch with a friend one weekday afternoon . i 'd heard him talk about this place a few times as its ' close to his office so i had high hopes . it 's very latin themed when you walk in , bright and cheery colors .
3 i stopped by the asu location this morning as i had n't eaten breakfast and was hella hungry . i was quickly greeted and ordered the breakfast sandwich with hash browns . i had to wait a little bit for it , but you can watch them make the food
3 i had talked up this place to my boyfriend -lrb- only having been to the tempe location -rrb- , so we stopped by for a drink while on our way home . first of all , compared to the tempe cpc , this one is huge , and has awesome
3 always loved <unk> ! me and my date went here before the michael <unk> concert last night . we arrived about half an hour early from the light rail and were quickly accommodated since the place was pretty empty . the food and drinks were great -lrb- we both had
3 at the last minute , i changed my birthday dinner local from oregano 's to tcf . no hate against oregano 's , but i was n't really that hungry and wanted cheesecake as opposed to a pizookie for dessert . so we made our way to <unk> and our
3 not sure why people are surprised about the two drink minimum , it 's posted and is a fairly standard thing at all comedy clubs i 've been to . been here a few times , great club that grabs great acts . calamari = pass . mixed drinks =

3 ra has a hip fun setting and they are open late which is a real plus for this night owl . on the other hand it can get a little pricey and it 's not the best sushi i have had . i would recommend coming in during happy hour
2 looking for some great deep dish pizza ? try nello 's ! looking for some great raspberry ice tea ? nello 's is not so much your place . so i had a bad experience with the ice tea last time i was there , but nello 's really does
3 i do n't usually frequent julio g 's . maybe because i 'm so picky about mexican food and i prefer to cook it myself . but recently while at a friends wedding i was amused to find julio g 's was doing the catering . she was a bit
3 beautiful beautiful place . great for a romantic evening out in my opinion . quietly classy , yet not ridiculously <unk> . have not eaten any of their food ... this is just based on drinks , service , and ambiance . cool note : birthday <unk> for the birthday
3 the service was great and the wings are always excellent . : -rrb- cold beer , hot wings , great appetizers ... perfect place to go and watch some football .
2 this is a ridiculously trendy place that all the ties come to . but what matters is that the food is good . i just did n't particularly like the `` stuffy '' crowd that was there when i went ... um , hello , i probably make more than
3 i went here with a friend because `` that sign outside looks really expensive '' . lol i liked it actually ... i liked the inside decor , i liked the fact that they have photos of the rolls that you can order ... and they have a ton of

3 tiny place , with only 8-10 tables , but service is friendly and the food is good . tried both the savory and sweet crepes and was n't disappointed . they make their crepes a little thicker then i 'm usually used to , but with the sweet crepes ,
3 i think this place gets the stars for using willing to place spam on their menu and for <unk> fruit on a hot dog . it 's definitely a place that you must try so that you too can say that you 've had coconut , pineapple and chili on
2 a friend of mine was in town from the east coast and was craving mexican . i had never been here , but she suggested it so i was down . we got there right when they opened -lrb- 11am -rrb- and there were a few tables already seated .
3 came for a hh and stayed for dinner . i really enjoy the atmosphere -lrb- minus the fact that it was very warm and a little too loud -rrb- , but i really like walking in and seeing the large windows and open kitchen . it 's almost like walking
1 i was browsing yelp and saw all the bad reviews of aunt chiladas . i laughed because of all my bad experiences there myself . every time i have gone there for food i have had a horrible experience . they have very limited choices for vegetarians . now ,
3 great happy hour . this place makes me miss my old neighborhood . my husband and i used to go during happy hour and order tons of food and drinks and get out of there under $ 30 . our rotation of munchies includes potato skins -lrb- sans bacon -rrb-
1 yep . still sucks . went their recently for a friend 's birthday . did n't want to but it was for one of my oldest friends and i did n't want to disappoint her . i only ordered drinks and had some chips and salsa . drinks were good
3 tasty . unique . i drive by this location every day and noticed that pv burger company replaced 2 hippies beach house . i checked out the reviews and my husband and i decided to check it out . i swear we walked in to a so cal surfer dive
3 hipster alert ! i 'm not hating . i 'm just jealous . all joking aside , sidebar has a chill , dark , modern meets throwback atmosphere . their drinks are pricey but delicious . i believe the price is fair because the ingredients are high quality and the
3 tortillas . you order anything that comes in one of their delicious flour tortillas here and you ca n't go wrong . my absolute favorite is their egg and potato breakfast burrito . eat it with their delicious spicy hot sauce and you ca n't go wrong . oh how

3 just had a hot sausage sandwich with peppers , provolone and marinara and it was delicious . great take-out place with wide range of cold and hot sandwiches . i prefer ordering from the hot list .
4 this is a great family-run bagel shop . they remember your name after only a few times in and the bagels are always fresh . good coffee and the lox is good . i have nothing but good things to say here .
3 this location is a good trek for us , so we 've only been here once . first impression was , whoa ! much bigger than some of the parks we 'd been to . there were the <unk> offerings -- miniature golf , go karts , bumper boats ,
4 in my teens , we snuck in here and used the pool . it was like <unk> your nose up against the glass and watching how the other half lives . last year , my hubby and i took advantage of a summer residents ' special and finally got to

2 so far , not impressed . i was really hoping to find another great pho place , but alas . we tried the `` nhat special '' sandwiches for lunch and they were definitely not special . what they were was thinly sliced pork and cucumbers -- no cilantro ,
2 overrated in my book . not bad food , some of it was pretty good . but , i can have much better pasta , much better to home . the setting is very nice , though , with <unk> bricks , <unk> lights and <unk> grape vines .
4 my parents took me here , i 've taken my kids here , and they will likely take their kids here . pinnacle peak patio is an arizona classic ! the bbq is great and so are the fixin 's , especially the cowboy beans and the <unk> . the
4 one of the best mexican restaurants in the valley . simple , authentic dishes prepared with <unk> ingredients . the salsas are wonderful . another plus is the band in the dining room . do n't let the exterior put you off . plan for some time either before or

4 i 've been going to this restaurant since i was a student at nearby west high school . it remains my favorite mexican food in phoenix to this day . the recipes are great , food is always consistent and the ownership has remained in the family since inception .
2 i liked pomo the ambiance is nice but nothing special . service , fast and friendly . food , superb . the tiramasu was the best i 've ever tasted . one small problem ... the portions are ridiculously small . if claim jumper is at one extreme with its

4 i 'll give you several good reasons to eat here , particularly men . first , it 's in the new scottsdale quarter , which if you have n't been to yet is worth the trip . lots of upper end shops that attract lots of <unk> folks , but
3 dos equis amber drafts are two dollars on tuesdays . they 're 20 oz glasses . allow me to captain obvious this for ya . seven glasses of this fine <unk> brew , or approximately <unk> ounces , -lrb- just a little over a gallon -rrb- will only cost you
0 i havent been to pv mall for many years since moving to north scottsdale , so it was a surprise to see how run down the place is . the final straw for me was watching as a young man shook down a shopper in dillards for bus fare .

3 i have been going to this establishment for years and i still love it . the food is fair bar type food . although they have changed ownership and brew masters they still make good beer . i have to say though the former brew master had a wider array
3 not always the best price and often over crowded but still like costco . my biggest complaint is that they are in bed with the sleazy company american express . i so wish they would break that tie then i would give them 5 stars .

3 food and ambiance at saddle ranch area really 2.5 stars at most , but the service and drinks are always on point . i work right around the corner @ the <unk> , so my co-workers and i have had many lunches here . our group averages about 12-15 people
3 i eat here about <unk> per week . food is good , service is typical of a divey asian establishment , it 's cheap and very close to where i live . try the banh <unk> -lrb- # <unk> -rrb- . it 's my new favorite thing to order !
2 my friends and i had to do an errand at citynorth after the oye @ az wine so we asked gabi for a recommendation nearby for burgers . she suggested 25 degrees and it worked out perfectly since it was right by where we needed to be . we were
2 nothing special about this theater . it 's swarming with teeny <unk> , the parking lot sucks ass -lrb- big time ! -rrb- , lines are long & slow and the tickets & food are over priced . and what 's this i read about student discounts only being limited
4 why have i not been coming here for years ? i always went to the starbucks across the street for coffee and treats , but never will i go there again if i can help it . luci 's healthy marketplace has the best breakfast ! it 's real food
3 i came here with my wife to meet up with a friend . i walk in and think this place is pretty neat . it 's got a good feel to it and the barista was very nice . i had an americano -- one of the best i 've
2 my wife and i dropped in for happy hour a few days ago . i was sort of on a sushi kick . i was excited to come try this place out because the happy hour menu looked really good with reasonably prices . -lrb- i checked it out online
3 i love this place . i 've been here a handful of times and keep coming back because of the atmosphere . coffee is pretty much coffee everywhere . i 've been to several and they 're all pretty much the same . that 's the case here too .
4 d'lish is amazing on all levels : food , service , convenience ... they just have it all . i go here for a quick breakfast and they definitely have some healthful -lrb- and flavorful -rrb- options . the california club is my favorite ... turkey , avocado , bacon
2 i 'm on the fence with haps . on a good day , this is a 4 star bbq joint . however , i have found that there are some inconsistencies . they have great bbq sandwiches with a deliciously balanced sauce and a nice quality bun . i liked
3 so here 's my situation . i 'm on a bus -lrb- yes . . a bus -rrb- to los angeles . my bus picks up at 3 asian markets in the valley then heads to la . . let 's just say i am a bit out of place
3 yard house is awesome . it is my go-to place in westgate for some good beer and delicious food . i always attempt to try at least one new beer when i come here , but am usually drawn back to my usual hoegaarden . to start , i like
3 i know this place is overrated and definitely is n't the best cupcake shop in town , but i added a star because of their service . 3 star cupcakes with 5 star service . we came here for a treat for my little brother 's birthday and could n't
3 saw christopher <unk> here , found out it was a charity event . the comics were funny . <unk> was our server ... amazing !!! she rocked . it sucked that one of the <unk> people was sitting in front of me -lrb- i am barely over 5 ' -rrb-
0 place just opened for the day and the restrooms by the food court are already disgusting and the <unk> are just standing in the food court texting and looking stuff up on their phones while talking to each other .
2 a funky little shop .
2 it 's cheap and you can always get a table , usually a bar stool . <unk> makes a badass chicken philly cheesesteak with jalapenos .
1 i <unk> returned after my first review at the <unk> of a good friend . my previous review stands but i have to mention that this bar is full of ugly people . seriously , these are some homely patrons . i ca n't go back because if this is
1 oh this hurts . i was so very excited to check out da vang as i am a vietnamese food nut and have <unk> to find a decent joint here in the valley . da vang is not that place . let me clear this up first . when i
3 cool enough venue , not much character but great acoustics and that 's what you want when you shell out more than $ 100 for a concert . how about dropping your fees a bit , eh ?
2 does being in the ghetto make you extra divey ?
2 very mediocre , very salty , very large portions . meh .
3 i love it . an amazing <unk> building full of all kinds of cool things . the food was fantastic , the music was fun , the fresh squeezed lemonade was tasty and the atmosphere was super cool . no <unk> here .
2 i still ca n't get a handle on this place . depending on the time of day you seem to attract either mostly elderly alcoholics or douchebags from the suburbs . where are the hipsters ?
2 i only use the driving range and can only comment on that . the range is spacious and pleasant but there are only three left handed tee boxes on the main level and two of them <unk> out the last time i was there . other than the difficulty of
0 it was alright . i was there with real good peeps so it made all the difference . food was pretty good . wings were grilled and kind of different . however , i must say they forgot shrimp in my friends <unk> . i mean c'mon !!! we did
2 i had been contemplating between 2 and 3 stars and decided to go towards higher end . here is the scoop : we went there last night for a little get together , were greeted and seated in the small private room . so far so good . we had
2 what can i say - it was not great . it really was not . yes they do have a lot wines , they a cellar after all . but we <unk> there for a dinner for a special occasion and i was disappointed . first impression was - <unk>
1 ahhh almost forgot bout this place . we went there for lunch from work when it first opened up . my friend could not shut it about philly steak and <unk> -lrb- or whatever its called . -rrb- so , they dragged me in there . i could not bring
2 pierre , with comments like that i have no choice lol swaddee is ok . see , there i did not say it sux or not worth it . you happy now ? lol ; -rrb- yeah , its alright . been there bunch of times for lunch from work
3 yay ! i 'm a fan ! big time . this was some seriously delicious experience . there are a lot of <unk> eastern places out there but hanging a few pictures on the walls and putting hummus on the menu does not automatically make it so . this place
2 the habit has yet to become a habit with me . i have come here a few times when visiting phoenix , and while i have enjoyed the mushroom swiss charburger and love their onion rings -lrb- their fries are okay -rrb- , i have yet to feel drawn enough
4 having just moved back to phoenix , i was glad to see that they opened a potbelly on camelback . i have loved potbelly since i was a kid , when my family and i used to frequent the original sandwich shop on lincoln avenue in chicago . while i
4 this is the first dine-in theater i 've ever been to , and i love it . for one , the big , <unk> chairs are super comfortable . the first time i came to this theater , about a month and a half ago , i did not realize
2 this is pretty much all you got here in az , i guess . and for that kinda big but still small fun , it does its job . i can honestly say that in the midst of the fun with the kids that i somewhat forgot i was in
1 i tried the pad-thai . not that great . the sauce was ... somewhat bitter and past that it did n't get any better . noodles were cooked well , so was the beef and the <unk> . its just the sauce was bad . price was ok . i
2 this is my first fine-dining experience . unfortunately , i was not impressed . i guess i expected a waiter like <unk> when he cleared his mind of everything but fine dining and breathing . but what i got was just a regularly decent wait staff . nothing wrong with
2 first time here . i got the greek fries and a gyro . both dishes had a <unk> taste to them which was n't necessarily unpleasant ... just different . i was n't expecting it on my gyro especially . since i 'm ignorant to authentic greek cuisine , i
3 do i even need to write a review after all the raving comments here ? maybe not , but i feel like my dining experience will be complete when i officially give roka akor props for such a fantastic meal . lots of veggie options is a must for me
3 after living in tempe for 2 years , i 'm very grateful to be now living within 10 minutes of this whole foods . if i had to rank all wf in the valley , this would n't be at the <unk> top , but it 's a huge improvement
3 i have to say <unk> for someone who <unk> herself a foodie - i 'm almost surprised by how high i 'm rating a chain like this . yet there is no denying that my experience has been nothing but positive here . food , beer and staff have been
3 pour me a glass and bake me a pie , cuz i 'm gon na be here for a while . though humble and almost <unk> on the outside , <unk> has a beautiful interior with great acoustics . lots of bustling ambient noise to make you feel like you
2 i <unk> , but i 'll never be loyal . i have been a sunflower patron since i moved to az and was a little sore that i had to switch to sprouts when we moved to arcadia . i know they are essentially the same store , but i
1 after 5 years in phoenix and so much anticipation of trying coronado cafe , i was extremely underwhelmed . nothing was bad . nothing was stellar . i did n't hate my meal , but was more perplexed by raving reviews after such a mediocre experience . we kicked off
2 i 'm lukewarm about chelsea 's . love the patio , front and back . love the noisy <unk> . and love wasting time with wine and friends for hours here . but i have to say i 'm not thrilled with the food . the veggie options are ok
2 it takes a great deal of perspective and mental <unk> to give this place even a neutral review . however , i feel the positive deserves to be mixed in with the negative , because , overall , this place is decent during happy hour if you get past the
4 it was new years day , and bf and i were driving back from flagstaff craving bbq . we managed to miss the exit off the i-17 to go to one of the bbq joints up in anthem , and when we tried to go to another nearby bbq place
2 i 'm torn on this one . i had tried rudy 's in nyc during the bbq fest a few different times and remembered liking it , so i was stoked to learn they had a location outside of austin . some aspects of this place are fabulous , but
4 went here for so <unk> football last sunday against the <unk> . so glad i did ! this place was completely jam-packed <unk> fans - it was so much fun ! service was impressive and tvs at every angle so that patrons would n't miss a single play . have
4 ever miss playing with your friends at <unk> ? well , you can again at the yard ! i was quite impressed with this venue on saturday night , i must say . first of all , love that yard is `` <unk> shotgun '' with one of my faves
3 this joint is just fine by me !! located several blocks south of the true and loud `` entertainment district '' of old town on main st. i 'm in love w/their dcor - love all of the exposed brick , wood and lovely chandeliers ! service is always friendly
4 kelly 's is one of my go-to spots for watering holes in old town . i do n't feel `` too old '' here but i also do n't feel the place is crawling <unk> either . good diverse mix of ppl . it 's pretty chill still around 9
4 went here today for lunch and it exceeded my expectations ! we had egg rolls and spring rolls to start and they were perfect ! i ordered # 22 and was totally blown away by it . not only did the food taste wonderful , but the chefs have excellent
3 you know , the older i get , the less and less i 'm inclined to eat at chains . even if they 're pretty rock solid . why you ask ? because i suppose it 's bc mentally i know that if i fly to any other major ,
3 i took a group of 8 friends here last friday night and everyone just loved it ! we had a diverse group , including some newbies to thai cuisine but everyone had something that they enjoyed ! the space is very clean and modern , and the menu is huge
3 sometimes i just want an omelet . and sometimes it is at lunch time during the middle of the week when the only options to fulfill this craving would be going to denny 's or ihop . lucky for me my office is near joe 's diner and they serve
2 i first stumbled upon the original market bistro on thunderbird a couple of years ago , i liked it , and tried to stop by when i was in the area . i was excited to see a location move to scottsdale , and i have been there a couple

3 this place has been around forever , and while i do n't ever remember eating here before , my dad assured me that i had . the place is no frills on the outside , but has a quaint charm to it on the inside . the chips and salsa
3 oh my goodness ... a 30 minute wait at restaurant on a friday night ... that has n't happened in a while ... it must be a good sign ! i have n't had to wait at a restaurant in forever , but rigatony 's was very accommodating and would

1 so have you heard the news ? they have an oven that cooks food at 1000 degrees , which means that food gets cooked faster ! wrong ! i am not sure if they are still trying to iron out the kinks , but on a tuesday at lunch ,
3 loco patron has the best seafood tacos in town !! whether you go with the grilled mahi or the grilled shrimp , you will not be disappointed ! they are cooked perfectly and then served in warm corn tortillas and dressed with shredded cabbage , cheese and yummy sauce that
1 i had to revise my review - the rose and crown has <unk> their menu , and , my friends , it is not good . i love me some pub trivia - my husband and i have been going for several years , and it is just fun !
3 yes , the service is slow , but the food is fantastic . i say this while eating leftovers for breakfast ... so . yummy . great cheese selection , awesome , jam packed menu , cool drink list . i had the cheese , garlic and tomato lavosh pizza
3 great location , sucky parking . being so close to the mall you have to drive around and find something . the food was what i have come to expect . they were able to accommodate our party of 10 in a matter of minutes -lrb- lunch made that easier
0 i will not be returning . this is place used to have the best beer in town . i got their summer honey ale and it was bitter . service was slow , spotty , and their classic mac & cheese recipe has been changes . it was a <unk>
4 best ... coffee ... ever !
4 love this place . food is always good , service is always good , and the roadhouse cherry limeade is always good . easy for <unk> of for family night with a <unk> 4 year old .
3 love the bean dip with the chips and salsa . no one does that and i think it is <unk> . the margaritas are great , if you get them on the rocks . i was n't a fan of the frozen banana margarita . it did not have a
2 we only ever get the louisiana chicken pasta or cheesecake any more . i think the menu is so big that it is hard for them to have any specialties -lrb- other than cheesecake -rrb- . the last 5 dishes i 've had have been nothing special at all ,
4 wow , how have i never been here before now ?? this is one great place . the food is <unk> and of the highest quality . i have never had a beef sandwich be both juicy and tender at the same time . i ca n't wait to go
3 i was really impressed . i had not been in years but it was on the way home . i got one of those last minute `` can you get a pizza '' <unk> before i left work . this was right on my way and the pick up window
3 my motto is keep your money in town ! so we met at spinato 's just to see what we could see . i had -lrb- exact quantity <unk> -rrb- glasses of the <unk> red which comes from the <unk> wine company up in <unk> . i want to <unk>
3 ambiance : we had the private dining room in the back - plus server : knew every special , could describe chipotle to a tourist from <unk> - plus plus menu - interesting but not pretentious -lrb- big plus in my book -rrb- i know people go there for the
4 for my daughters 21st birthday we decided to take the family to flemings and dc ranch . we drive by this restaurant on a daily basis and yet have never given them a chance so i never knew what we were missing until now . the atmosphere is very nice
1 ok this place is nice i wont dispute that and i expected it to be expensive but $ <unk> for two adults and three kids to see an afternoon kids show almost pissed me off and set the stage for a bad experience . the next issue is the food
4 hip hip hooray for the tom 's thumb car wash and dining experience . yes 5 big ones for a company with a lame name and less than favorable location . we 've lived in the area for years and unfortunately never ventured into this wonderful little bistro . food
2 i have since returned to rosita 's after my <unk> experience and it seems to be just fine . just fine as in it would be amazing if located in a northern state , but here in arizona where delicious mexican food is plentiful , it does n't stand out
3 this place is very strange . the atmosphere is more like a foreign grocery store than a restaurant , but the food is really good . ok , i have only ever tried one dish but the other food looks really good too ! they have a large selection of
4 such a fun store ! they have all kinds of gifts like jewelry that i have n't seen other places , and a ton of books ! in my opinion an <unk> amount of <unk> is taken up by hippie / spiritual / new age stuff . the science fiction
2 while the happy hour prices are friendly , this place is simply not for me . the `` scene '' was very `` wannabe hipster , '' to a laughable extent . i was here with some coworkers , but would never visit this place on my own time .
1 bland . while the decor is lovely and the customer service was above average , the food was just not impressive . i was disappointed , because the menu left much to desire . if you want some seriously great thai food , try the pink pepper in mesa .
4 several years ago i made a dinner reservation for my fianc 's birthday at kai . if you know anything about that place you 'd know it 's the only five diamond restaurant in arizona , so it sounded like it would be an amazing spot for a birthday celebration
4 hands down , crudo is one of my favorite restaurants in phoenix . everything on their menu is phenomenal . i highly recommend the ahi and the albacore ; the fish is so fresh and delicious that i 'm practically salivating just thinking about it . i 've eaten in
4 my go-to mexican place ! i 've been eating here for years and i love this restaurant . it could probably use a bit of a makeover , but the food is authentic , fresh and delicious . i probably eat here once or twice a month and i 've
2 north 's great location - in kierland commons - is what initially made me try it . i stopped by while out for an evening of shopping with a friend . we were both tired and feeling a little under the weather , so we thought italian would be nice
2 dropping some stars due to the <unk> policy . myself and four friends bought tickets to the luminarias a bit ago . it rained today , so the luminarias were canceled , which i understand . however , as the event is sold out every other night , we were
4 if you are looking for local culture , this is it . as a recent transplant to phoenix , i really enjoyed my visit to the museum and learned a lot about the local native american cultures . this is also a must visit when people visit you in phoenix

2 if you can mentally stomach paying $ 19 for a ` vegan nosh ' plate , by all means , go for it ... you 're a better -lrb- <unk> -rrb- -lrb- wo -rrb- man than i . the salmon plate was good , but again , not worthy of
4 so ... i think pomegranate and i might have more than a spring fling . i do n't want to <unk> it , but this could be really serious . i introduced pomegranate to my mom , my best friends , and even my current boyfriend , but everyone agrees
3 the best dim sum i 've ever had was in los angeles at <unk> <unk> . this is a pretty close second . i was surprised to find this in arizona . i had a sunday morning hankering for pork buns and sesame balls -lrb- that sounds so naughty !
3 some friends introduced my husband and i to rosa 's a while back and it was love at first bite . i grew up in arizona so i know the difference between real -lrb- at least arizona real -rrb- mexican food and chi chi 's . anyone here from the

3 yum ! the pizza at nypd is awesome but first i have to rave about the garlic knots . these little nuggets of joy are bread knots cooked to perfection and soaked in olive oil and garlic . i 've never actually gone for any of their specialty pizzas because

3 i 'm usually skeptical when a restaurant claims to have very healthy food that 's under a certain amount of calories because the food is either , a. served in kiddies sized portions so you end up snacking later on in the evening anyway , or b. dull and flavorless
2 since this place is next to lee lee market , i decided to give it a try . if you want really good boba , go to the street right next to hodori in mesa . * decor = very cute . reminded me of typical l.a. boba place .
2 tried this place b/c we heard that it is somewhat historical . definitely not fancy , decently priced ice cream parlor . nothing special . * decor = had it 's own charm . nothing fancy . * service = it took a while for the waitress to come but
3 my bf is a little sick right now and i was craving thai . since it was the weekend , i did n't wan na cook you know ? few weeks ago , we got the entertainment book . so we looked through and there was a coupon for 20

3 these guys know pizza . there are a few pizza options in old town but i would walk out of my way to go here . it 's your standard fold in half and drip the grease into your mouth pizza , but that 's exactly what i went when
4 how can you not love this place . i 'm the kind of person that will rather go buy a carton of ice cream at fry 's over getting my sweet fix at an ice cream shop since you get much more for the same price , but this is

2 unfortunately , given my most recent experiences here and my most recent experiences at khai hoan -lrb- see update -rrb- , i will have to downgrade my rating for this place . my basic gripe is that they do n't really give you much in terms of noodles or accompaniments
3 this has become my go to place for pho . the food is usually really good , but i wish it would be more consistent . there have been times when i have gotten the pho or bun bo hue and it was so fresh and flavorful , and then
3 as already mentioned by other yelpers : the best miso ramen in phx . very tasty soba noodles . katsu chicken entree is also very good . not pricey at all for what you get , which is a significant amount of very tasty food . decor : booth seats
4 so close to 5 stars , so why not . the appropriate category for essence bakery is gourmet cafe and bakery . the freshness and quality of the ingredients -lrb- organic or locally grown -rrb- and the care put into making each order is absolutely apparent in the taste and
2 we just returned from having lunch at spotted donkey cantina and it was pretty good , except for a couple things . the lettuce in the little salad that came with my enchiladas had obviously come out of a bag because it tasted terrible . i had one bite and

2 pv mall is one of the nicest in the area , even though the do not have as many of the high-end shops as fashion square does in old town . no matter , this is one of the original malls in scottsdale and you can sometimes see the history
3 i stop at chloe 's corner about once a week for a quick bite . they do a nice business because they 're the only sandwich place in kierland commons , for those of us who work nearby . like sarah y , i love their egg salad sandwiches .
3 happy hour review : we came for the tempe arts fair , <unk> but decided to checkout the happy hour at la bocca . for the last three years , this restaurant and it 's chef <unk> wright is all anyone can talk about . it feels like phoenix 's

3 the street tacos are great . just make sure you <unk> beef or chicken or you 'll get whatever the cook decides . you must try the sweet potato fries ! half priced wine on sundays ! great patio with misters . nice place for casual group on a weekday
3 i do n't eat here that often , but when i do , i am never disappointed . service is generally pretty good and the food portions are quite large . my favorite there of course is the matzo ball soup . it basically is a delicious tasting chicken noodle
0 this place was so disappointing . maybe they are known for their sushi , but since we were there for noodles , we did n't order sushi . unfortunately , their udon dish that they used to have in a broth was no longer on the menu . our server

3 i quite enjoyed my trip to los dos molinos . the atmosphere is pretty casual , so this is n't exactly a great spot to bring a fancy date or hold an important business meeting , but the layout , decor , and ambiance is great for a night out
3 i have had great food every time i that i have came . the prices are very <unk> love that they have a great selection of beer and wine . my favorite dish is the parmesan crusted chicken ! it is delicious . but i have had <unk> apps and

3 this is the best italian restaurant in phoenix . the place is very small and cozy , and decorated very warmly inside . they have a private nook in the back corner of the restaurant , as well as a full bar . live music is featured most nights .
2 the restaurant is situated in the worst location of the arizona center . the owners other restaurant -lrb- sam 's cafe -rrb- got the primo spot with the patio . they have a pretty trendy bar area , and great burgers . i like the fact that there is something
2 excellent chips and salsa , great patio , and consistent food . the `` limit 2 '' <unk> are so strong i have never actually wanted a second one . i like the ahi salad a lot , which is a spicy seared ahi with their raspberry <unk> , and

4 200 + tequilas , one of the only places for cochinita pibil , and amazing tableside guacamole with pomegranate seeds . this restaurant is amazing . do n't go here if you are one of those <unk> looking for a chimichanga with rice and beans all topped with red sauce
1 went here this past saturday with my family for lunch . the place is extremely <unk> , if not the most <unk> restaurant in central phoenix . i felt really out of place , but my mom had to go there as she swore by their chicken sandwich and hummus
1 i have to agree with the reviewers here . this place is just not good . we went there before a suns game because every other place was packed . steve 's was empty and now i know why . i ordered their signature green house pasta , which was

3 i 'm going to have to downgrade pizza a metro after my last visit . it 's still one of the best pizzas in town , and the service is still good , but they took away the amazing bread and tapenade they used to give out before the meal
2 ok so we wanted to go to zipp 's to play games ... my fault for wanting to go there at 5pm on a monday . happy hour crowd killed it , so we went next door to dilly dally and were kind of scared out of our <unk> .
4 how many curse words can i say in one sentence to describe how good this place is ? holy f ***** g hell , this is the best g ***** n thing i 've ever f ***** g eaten that only cost $ 4 and s ** t , b

3 tried this place out for lunch today and i must agree with most of my fellow yelpers that this place is legit . any carnivore would love to eat at this place . i had the cheddar cheeseburger with fries and a drink . the burger came dressed with pickles
4 this is an amazing shopping experience . i liked this fry 's before the remodel . i like it even more now . the previous reviews highlight the wonderful things about this location , and additions since reopening . one of my favorite things they have here is grilled salmon
4 i love this place - this family owned restaurant is one of my favorites . just went again last night - their ravioli ala <unk> are divine , and my most common choice . my daughter had their rigatoni <unk> , also . you ca n't beat freshly made pasta
4 i love this place ! the reviews cover so many of the details , and i hate to be <unk> . here are the highlights , according to moi ! - super fresh food - amazing vegetarian options - perfectly seasoned - food is even better than it sounds on
4 everything is still great there and - they 've <unk> up on the debit thing - no more odd restrictions when you pay . that 's got ta be better for business all the way around . a few more tidbits o ' info : the sausage is homemade ,
1 gross ! bland deli meat on bland sub bread with bland toppings . was it food ? yes . so i guess it requires stars .
2 it 's annoying here . i 've been many times , the service is always good . but the restroom doors , hideous art pieces and boring menu are not cute anymore .
3 the fries are fantastic , and the burger is good . i love being able to add grilled onions and sauted mushrooms as a free topping . yummy .

4 everything you always wanted to know about the best ways to eat at the bar , but were afraid to ask . spot quiz . . pick the correct answer . it does n't take much more than some nice meat on some nice bread to make an out of

3 i ca n't believe i have n't reviewed this place yet . i guess i took it for granted as it was my first <unk> sushi experience in arizona . i love zen 32 , for a lot of reasons , but have a few minor complaints . i think
0 if i could give 0 stars i would , if i had the energy i would rate every ra in the country this `` 0 '' . thank you to the <unk> for <unk> the 0 as a concept . this place is completely cliched , lame , and annoying
2 i have to say this is one of the better sushi places in phoenix . they have large cuts of fish , and great prices . downsides : menu lacks variety , and they have abysmal decor . the service is ok , nothing that will knock your socks off
2 this place is excellent price wise and has a decent variety . my only complaint is the setup of the seating ... check it out ... <unk> ...
1 perhaps it 's superbowl weekend that made boa seem sub par , or maybe it was the fact that you can only get happy hour prices at the bar , or even the way the bartender was more concerned about setting the <unk> to record some <unk> show , instead
3 <unk> is <unk> by most downtown residents i know . i attribute this in part to the location , which is hidden away on the second floor of the visually <unk> <unk> center . out of sight , out of mind . despite that , it 's a nice place
2 after 3 bad experiences at cibo over time , each caused by pretty random circumstances , i wrote a fairly nasty , <unk> review of this place last night . basically , they ran out of some of their specials , did n't tell us in a timely manner ,

4 i feel like a major douche giving az88 five stars , since it is the <unk> <unk> in all of <unk> aka scottsdale . but let me focus on the positive before you get mad at me for <unk> scottsdale ... i have no choice but to admit it :
3 good <unk> . good gumbo . great service provided by two very cute twin sisters who i think are the cajun owners . a tad pricey for a working day lunch crowd . i do n't get a very authentic feel from the food but that 's not to say
4 what the hell is this place doing in mesa ? ok ok , i kid . i 'm a believer in giving props when they are due , and mesa scores big with this place , no question . the food was very good , and appropriately priced -lrb- a

3 i have n't been here in quite a while , but when i was coming here , they had a jazz band doing rock and alternative covers -lrb- their name is the latest , though i do n't think they play here anymore -rrb- . the place is totally trendy
3 mmmmmmm good . i enjoy their food and really like the salads . it is a fun place to pop in for a lunch . i can go light or heavy with a meal and get a enjoyable glass of wine to go with it .
4 my favorite phoenix restaurant . vincent understands customer loyalty and his hospitality and food will bring you back again and again . often when we travel , my husband and i will remark that vincent has spoiled us because we compare everything to eating with him . if you like
2 loved the food ! the parking is a bit of a challenge but valet is an option . my mouth is watering right now just thinking about the different dishes i have tried there . any of the grilled fish -lrb- not on the sea watch list -rrb- will fill

3 i 've been hearing a lot of good stuff about windsor -lrb- especially from my biz partner who is <unk> -rrb- , so finally hit it up for afternoon cocktails and <unk> last week . pretty impressed . nice selection of beers -lrb- with $ 5 pitchers of stella on
2 not really sure what all the fuss is about . perhaps i 'm biased ... my girlfriend is from long island , ny , and the bagel shops there are incredible . the customer service here is good and the food is decent , but the prices are a little
3 great brunch spot in downtown scottsdale with a helpful staff and a wonderful patio .
4 the ultimate arizona cowboy bar . this was so much fun . amazing atmosphere , fun live music and dancing , terrific <unk> , plus they have a donkey , <unk> , and dollar bills <unk> all over the place . this is a <unk> az experience .
4 my girlfriend and i came here last night , and loved it . service was excellent . keep in mind we were pretty much the only ones in the restaurant , but still , the whole staff was very friendly and helpful . the food was delicious . we shared
3 this is a great place , especially for right before an event at the us airways center or another nearby venue . the service was outstanding and the food was delicious . prices were a little more than we expected , but overall this was a great spot for dinner
3 i will write this for both the camelback location and the one in central scottsdale . if you 're looking for a fun happy hour party -lrb- both regular and late-night -rrb- , do the camelback location in old town . it 's much more lively , there 's a
3 i do n't think i have ever had a more enthusiastic server in my life . a short <unk> helped my girlfriend and i out , and obviously loved her job . the burger i got was huge and delicious . the fries and tots were great , too .
2 i have n't stayed at the clarendon hotel , nor have i dined in the restaurant . what i have done at the clarendon is get ridiculously hammered at the roof top bar ... . more than once . the hotel itself does boast eclectic modern decor with some quirky
3 okay , so i 'm an <unk> <unk> . i admit it . i 'm ever so thankful to my parents for a kickass <unk> because dammit i love to eat and drink and drink some more ... roll around in gelato occasionally ; you know , the usual .
3 seriously ... everyone wanting to blow chris bianco is a little annoying , however , i must say , the sammies are pretty damn good . on my first visit -lrb- ya , i was shocked they were open too -rrb- i had the tuna . my decision was based
3 4.5 stars . i 'm not a member of the ` clean plate club ' but i was jumped in last night and i have the food baby to prove it . delicious southern mexico style cuisine that yes , will put a minor ding in your wallet if you
3 this place is sexy ... . <unk> . this is a review of the downstairs loungey sexy area , not the regular dining area . is there a regular dining area ? huh ... do n't remember seeing it . anyway , the `` small plates '' menu is divine
1 this gym is over sold . period . really , i could stop right there but what 's the fun in that . since cleaning out my <unk> closet of alcoholic loser ` friends ' , i tend to spend a lot of time at the gym . between the
3 if you are in the mood for pizza this is possibly the best pizza , no it is the best pizza that i have had thus far from tempe . this is a five star if tempe was the only place in arizona . they have amazing pizza that does
3 i went into tops after turning 21 and found that the selection was awesome . you can mix and match beers if you 'd like and they have so many beers to choose from . they also have a bar next door that i have yet to try but i
3 true food kitchen is another successful fox restaurant concept . along with the other two places i have tried , ` olive and ivy ' and ` montana avenue ' , i have yet to be disappointed by a meal by this company . i would advise checking out their
4 i live down the street from tuck shop and really enjoy riding my bike to go to dinner . this place is perfect for that . the food is delicious and the staff is super friendly . i 've had a few of their plates and i 'm not disappointed
3 i wanted to hit up <unk> one day but somehow i ended up here . there is something about this food that makes you want to roll yourself out of the building and take a nap for about 3 days . i mean , smothered pork chops ! who does
3 wow ! this place is great for the area . it 's been hard to find a pho place in north phoenix that i really like and i finally did it . i went with the egg noodle soup which some would argue is n't true pho but i say
2 went to la condesa around <unk> on a weeknight and drove right by it a couple of times . no lights on outside at all . the parking was kind of scary as well . on to the food . the shark taco was good until i ran into a
4 i live in central phoenix and wanted some dim sum badly ! i did n't want to drive up to my usual place since i was going the opposite direction , to tempe . i looked up and found this place served dim sum . yay ! me and a

3 although i wo n't be given a 5 star review , i would easily say that the cornish pasty in it 's own special way fits in my top 3 restaurants i 've been too in phoenix . i had never tasted pasties before until meeting my girlfriend and had
4 ok , i went back and i had the bbq chicken pizza . i added bacon . it was completely and ridiculously delicious . the chicken was tender , juicy and delicious . it tasted like it had just come right off the grill !!! i absolutely recommend trying the
2 ok , as far as italian goes this place is pretty decent . the big pull for here is the amazing value . buy one of any of the classic dishes and take home another classic dish for later all for the single dish price . the food is basic
3 such a beautiful restaurant ! sit outside on the patio , even when its chilly it 's not bad out here due to the fireplace and multiple space heaters . had brunch , the pancakes , light and fluffy and delicious . one curiosity was the strong lemon flavor to
4 when pita jungle is insanely packed , just walk across the street and i promise you will better food at a cheaper price . their hummus is absolutely delicious and i love their lamb ! perfectly seasoned food and a great price ! hit this place up over pita jungle
4 the owner was awesome enough to open the bar up early for all us <unk> fans who wanted to see man u take down <unk> . i got there a little later , but the bartenders were happy to be serving drinks , and everybody was pretty wasted . i
3 i needed an inexpensive breakfast/lunch joint to take my parents after they were gracious enough to drive to az to help me pack and move . being that my dad was in a car for six hours without any real food , i knew i had to choose the restaurant
4 amazing sweet potato fries with the perfect aioli ! their burgers are good , just difficult to eat as the bun is very delicate . love coming here after hiking camelback for beer and fries ! they have a great beer selection !
3 came here last night with the <unk> to satisfy our craving for indian food . we 've talked about this place for a while , and i 'll be damned if i was leaving az before stopping by this place ! so luckily , i was able to convince one
4 this place is absolute perfection . from the setting to the service to the food , i loved every moment of it . the only way i found out about this place was through yelp . you seriously are my trusty <unk> . from the previous reviews i was a
4 just came here for a <unk> brunch with the parents , and i am sad that switch will no longer be in my city . their brunch menu is short , but has a good variety . i had the <unk> quiche , which was a little heavy on the
2 eh ... it was cheap but the tuna that came with my salad was n't that high quality . they do n't salt the edamame , but they are bigger than most sushi bars . i do n't think i would come back here , even for the drinks .
4 fogo de chao <unk> that i love meat . thank you so freaking much ! i will say that the integrated yelp reservation system does wonders , i highly recommend it . the meal comes in two phases : salad bar and served meat . you 'll get some side
3 as a vietnamese person myself , i 'm pretty sure i can recognize good pho . while i am well aware california is the best for pho , as a resident of arizona i think khai hoan is excellent . the pho broth is nice and light . also ,
1 service is getting bad after a couple years . relatively been ignored multiple visits , and have never been offered a water refill after the glass being empty for 20 minutes . the food 's still good , but i take back what i said of relatively good service .
3 i had been to riazzi 's with co-workers for the affordable lunch specials , so my husband and i decided to give it a try for dinner . we stopped in at just about 5pm on a sunday . the decor was lovely for the holidays ~ a big fancy
2 slices is good for a east coast pizza fix . nice thin slices , heated to crunchy after you select from a bank of pre-made pizzas . cheap , quick eats for lunch !
2 blackened scallops ? yep . brunch ? yep . southwest flare ? yep . cocktails , happy hour , noisy bar , eclectic seating ? yep , yep yep yep . there 's no sign on the door , no flash or flare , but if you scoot up the
3 i 've only ever been able to actually play bocce once at the vig , and that goes for both locations , but it 's hard to hold that against the place when the people watching is so good ... if you do n't meet someone you already know or
2 and <unk> in -lrb- a little -rrb- ... the -lrb- woody -rrb- smell ! <unk> ! it 's hip , it 's unmarked , it 's lined with real wood , there 's forgiving lighting , and a long , narrow arrangement of high tops , booths and upholstered seating
2 this is a happy hour review my favorite thing about this happy hour is that top shelf alcohols are included . i get my <unk> for $ 5 ea ! awesome ! first couple times back to sapporo hr since the owner change . i had very low expectations ,
2 went here on a groupon to try it . wow ! super friendly and courteous staff ! a + + + + tried the country fried <unk> was better than i expected ! not rubbery or overly greasy . good gravy . i am spoiled by the <unk> that i
2 i would give it 4.5 stars for music and decor . good <unk> music . decor is very vegas , hand mirrors and glass blown bubble chandeliers is the theme throughout , fitting for the name of the place . very appealing to the ladies haha went on a saturday
3 the food here is pretty good . i 've been coming here for years and they are pretty consistent , at least with certain items . i do n't eat the sushi here , nor have i really had it here , so i ca n't say if it 's
3 there really is n't very much great mexican food here , which does n't make very much sense to me , as we live in the southwest . we do n't really have much choice , so we frequent here about once a month or so . the pricing is
4 i love this place . . something for everyone . for garlic lovers - the garlic dip will not disappoint . you will ward off all <unk> guaranteed . philly <unk> lovers ... unforgettable . lemon chicken salad amazing -lrb- huge grilled chicken strips -rrb- , tuna pizza . .
3 yummm . love the lady is a scampi . . it 's all i ever seem to order from this place . ca n't get myself to stray . huge shrimp , pasta i perfect and full of flavor . as for everything else . . service was spot on
4 omg . if you 're afraid of flavor stay away because this place has the market cornered . papa <unk> , one of my favorites . but my absolute top pick so far is the <unk> frita . its just perfect . but there is soo much to choose from
4 ive been here a hundred and one times and i still do n't think ive ever had their pizza ??? i always get `` the lady is a scampi '' , it 's amazing and the shrimp are more than few and freakin ' <unk> sized ! ca n't beat
3 i flew in from a chilly gray day in san antonio to a gorgeous day in phoenix . had lunch on the patio here . . just wanted something light and this was perfect . assorted bruschetta , caprese salad and chilled riesling . everything was perfect , the food
3 came here for a final `` farewell to phoenix '' lunch with 10 of us . it was hot outside and the wait was an <unk> hour . what was nice was they had coolers of drink for the people waiting . once we were finally sat , the service
2 my friend was in town from <unk> and she wanted to do brunch somewhere . so i suggested olive & ivy . the 1st thing i asked about -lrb- and the entire reason i suggested this place -rrb- was the amazing cherry bread pudding dessert i had the first time
3 this review is long overdue . . for me anyway . came here labor day weekend , we were itching for some sushi and stumbled across this via the yelp app . we were not disappointed . sushi rolls were unique and delicious . . we had ; red <unk>
1 i just can not understand why this place is so highly rated . could it be that people have never experienced barbeque outside of arizona , so they have no basis of comparison ? but even that can not be true . we have joe 's in gilbert , and
1 i see a lot of really great reviews here for this place . i think it boils down to the type of place you are looking for . my thing is finding little family run ethnic places where the food is good and the prices low . service is important
3 the best chicken shawarma i have ever had . just the best . the place is run down , really in need of a makeover . i do n't care too much about that if the health department is okay with them . the grocery selection is okay , but
4 yesterday was my third time back and i have to bump them up to five stars now . i had the italian beef this time and it was probably the best i have ever had , certainly better to my taste than al 's in chicago . the service just
3 5 stars for the tortillas . buy a bag and try to make it home with them ... yummy !
3 a great little spot . my friends took me here for my going away party . it is small and in a strip mall . the gentleman , who helped us , was friendly . the chips and salsa were delicious . i got the tamale sampler and it was
4 i made reservations here for a work party i was planning for 35 people . i called and spoke with someone who advised she would have the chef call me back to confirm . he called me a day or two later and i told him what i was looking
4 i was very excited to come here for my first visit with a few friends this past sunday . it also made me a little nervous though because i was afraid i would be let down as i was expecting too much . well i definitely was not let down
2 so my friends and i came here for two specific reasons : food on a stick and people watching . those two purposes were well served ! steak on a stick , grilled corn , drinks ... we had fun watching people of all types -lrb- some even dressed as
1 i have heard many good things about bliss/rebar from my friends and family . so many in fact that when groupon featured a half-priced `` groupon '' i got two ! so i went to use one of the groupons last night . it was a saturday night , i

4 i 've been here numerous times and it 's been great everytime . i do n't think i have had the same thing twice -lrb- with exception to the <unk> -lrb- sp ? -rrb- pie -rrb- cornish pasty is not a place a would come to if i was rushed
2 the food is good , no complaints there . the service however , seems to be slipping lately . brad is awesome -lrb- i 'm bad with names so i am only <unk> % sure that 's really his name -rrb- and has helped me a few times and was
3 wife out of town . she does not eat sushi , so i thought this would be a good week to go out and enjoy . i know very little about sushi , just that i like to eat sushi . went on yelp and looked for a well review
3 we used to go quite often to famous dave 's with the family . everyone enjoyed the meals . we had not been for a couple of years . maybe we just got burned out on <unk> . it was early and my wife and i were looking for a
4 i just keep going back !!! if you want the best burger , best service , nicest people . this is the place to go . now i have not tried everything on the menu -lrb- yet -rrb- . but i am trying . we go there almost weekly to
3 this place has a nice lunch special . you get soup , salad and a three selection combination plate for about $ 13 . i chose the teriyaki beef , combination tempura and california rolls . i could n't finish my plate . the service was good and the atmosphere
3 now that i have moved to ca , i never get to eat at z ` tejas anymore . so i of course had to pay them a visit when i was in town . i ordered what i always ordered ... the chicken jerk salad . i do n't
1 i was really excited to finally try indulge burgers after having purchased a gift certificate from restaurant.com . i live quite far away , so we happen to be near the restaurant , we jumped at the opportunity . it 's a nice enough place . i did n't expect
4 this was a great dining experience ! i enjoyed everything about this restaurant . very nice outdoor seating in a quiet location , great food and good service . ca n't wait to go back !
4 i think that they use their happy hour into <unk> you into spending more money . the happy hour was good , but once i saw that tasting menu , i had to have it ! but first i did start with a drink from the happy hour menu .
3 i love the cornbread ! i love how it has nice whole <unk> and that it comes to your table warm . my husband ordered the special , which was the duck tacos . omg ! i hope it stays on the menu permanently . they were sweet yet spicy
1 so over priced it 's not even funny .
3 this place is a little pricey , but the sandwiches hit the spot . i 'm a fan of the `` where 's the beef ? , '' a vegetarian sandwich , aptly named because when you bite into it , you do n't give a damn where the beef
1 i 've been here a few times with my mom because she really likes it , but overall i was n't impressed . the food was tasty , but the service was atrocious . it was busy the last time we went , but we stood around inside the door
1 ************ like eating in the back seat of a <unk> *********** the servers ca n't even maneuver between tables . you will rub elbows with the neighboring table . *********** use to be a top notch italian restaurant ********* it seems they went on an aggressive expansion plan ... .
1 this review is about the attendants -lrb- ushers -rrb- . has a group they are totally unfamiliar with the seating plan . **** they 'll send you to another door , for best access to your seats . **** guess what , you were previously at the best door .

2 i had no clue i 've the sophistication of an <unk> when it comes to food until i read other zoes kitchen reviews . for our information , looking at the zoe 's kitchen web page , i found out they are a national chain . <unk> and catering are
2 you can eat and drink as irish as you please - or not , here . a diverse menu , fresh , tasty food , good service . a classy bar , a great place for st. paddy 's day or cinco de mayo .
4 from l.a. to boston , <unk> to <unk> , nello 's is best in my book of pizza .
3 best restaurant fry bread inside phoenix <unk> . <unk> style . we bring visitors . plan on standing in line during the lunch rush . better yet , come a bit earlier or later so you can find parking in the lot .
2 `` sandwiches my way '' march 16 , 2012 i <unk> 16th street searching for some of phoenix ' most <unk> street artists . not <unk> , gang bangers , not even <unk> . artists expressing themselves on <unk> walls , looking to be recognized , and maybe make a
4 my favorite movie theater in town . $ 5 movies before noon , nice neighborhood and surroundings , and not too many annoying <unk> children . yes , the <unk> should just be made into fixed stairs . i 've had the privilege of riding an <unk> one time in
4 awesome place for breakfast . hard to park and get into most times , but well worth it . have the dutch baby pancake . it 's stellar .
3 great place . my credit card and bank accounts have more memories of this place than i do , but it 's still good . go there anytime when the drunk high school idiots are not there -lrb- usually late during the week , never on friday or saturday -rrb-
2 i came here with a bunch of my friends after a late night . the service was great and fast . they were super friendly to us ! i get my usual pho tai which is super basic with just rare steak and noodles in broth . the broth flavor
1 i finally tried this place yesterday with a friend and i do n't get the <unk> have had a lot of sushi in my life so forgive me if i might be too harsh . i got the `` get <unk> '' roll and my friend got the `` dam
3 the gelato here is delicious , and the atmosphere is very upscale . it 's a nice place to go for a special occasion . the displays that they make with the gelato and the garnishes are really nice , and sometimes , they will even give you a piece
1 the food at hillside spot is wonderful -- i 've enjoyed both breakfast and lunch there a few times . however , the service is enough to make me not want to eat there anymore . other yelpers have described their service as `` slow and disorganized , '' and
4 the problem with north tempe is it 's dominated by large chain restaurants and starbucks . steve 's espresso breaks the mold and is the boutique coffee shop and lounge i 've been looking for . they have the best coffee , tea , and fresh made pastries in all
4 i 'm a realtor and i had recently finished showing a buyer <unk> and condos in downtown phoenix . i was looking for a good healthy place for lunch , and i of course pulled out my phone and turned to yelp for their recommendations . coronado cafe came up
3 other than 5th and wine this is one of the best wine bars i 've been to in scottsdale . it 's quiet , relaxing , and a great place to enjoy good wine and good company . the prices are fair , and the selection of wine is robust
3 my girlfriend and i love crust and frequent here often . they have amazing pizza , the rustica is enough for two , and we usually split a salad . they have whole wheat crust , upon request , which is actually really good . there service is awesome and
3 this is another fox restaurant concept and they 've once again created a unique and <unk> culinary experience based on a <unk> classic . i love mexican food and blanco has taken it to another level . they have a large menu with enough selection and diversity to satisfy anyone
3 came here last night for dinner at <unk> -lrb- they close at 8:30 -rrb- . there were several tables of diners as well as a couple parties of 5 + . t there was a lot of trash under the tables -lrb- like chopstick paper , napkins , etc -rrb-
4 i bought a coupon from <unk> deals so finally went last night . we had a sweet and spicy dog - <unk> style -lrb- brat , chipotle garlic mayo , spicy mustard , pineapple , sweet peppers , onion with cole slaw -rrb- and a hula dog -lrb- beef hot
4 went for dinner last night because i bought a living social coupon worth $ 10 . they gave us chips and salsa right away . the salsa is n't my favorite , but nothing bad about it . the chips were great ! -lrb- and maybe i was hungry too
4 i love it !! they 've got a great vibe going on , a fabulous menu for a coffee shack , drive thru and a wrap around patio ! thank you kyle and chad for outstanding service and d'lish drinks and food . i had a couple of their berry
4 everything was amazing , i 'm in love hard ! shared a cheese course and a bruschetta plank . my choice was the brie & apples with fig spread and prosciutto with figs & mascarpone -lrb- see pics -rrb- absolutely heavenly ! the cheese , the bread , omg ,
4 by far one of my favorite restaurants to eat vegan at . i ca n't believe i have n't updated my review , the first time i reviewed gallo i was not even vegan , it 's been a long time . the veggie tacos are out of this world
2 so i got here early this morning , around 7am . not too busy yet , but i was the only female in here beside the two grandmas sitting in the corner and all the grouchy waitresses . it was pretty funny watching all the waitresses <unk> around in their
3 i was in the area and craving some mexican food since it 's getting cooler outside . i will admit i went in here totally skeptical and ready to be disappointed ... ... . but you know what ... . i was n't !!! it was very clean , friendly
4 last week i was craving the tuna salad sammy from pugzies , it 's cold and crisp and perfectly refreshing on a hot day especially when paired with the fruit salad ! check out my glorious lunch -lrb- see pics -rrb- complete with a cream cheese brownie , which was
3 i 've never been climbing before and was excited to try it for the first time . the facility is huge and colorful which makes it look super fun and inviting . the staff were extremely helpful and friendly as well as very good at making a newbie like me
4 it 's been awhile since my last review and i 'm still giving 5 stars ! i like to come her for lunch and sit at the sushi bar because i 'm usually solo plus it 's fun to watch all the sushi being made . i like that richard

2 left me a bit blah . really like the atmosphere . served was really great . ive never had a really good meat . this time the salmon was a bit overcooked . for food , there are better options .
4 toby is the man at the sushi bar . i 've had some only okay experiences here , but last night was a 5 star night . and sunday 's bottles of sake are half price . <unk> peppers are a must as well as the crab hand roll .
0 there are far better options for price and quality .
3 i love pita jungle 's food . it 's delicious ! but i have to agree with the other reviewers about the service being terrible . it seems to have improved recently , but i still think referring to it as the `` hipster hooters '' is a pretty accurate
3 i am a big fan of indie bookstores . changing hands is a good one , if mostly for the <unk> atmosphere . mmmmm <unk> .
4 i 'm not an indian food connoisseur . i 'd only eaten it once before , i ca n't even remember what i had and it was purchased from a little hole-in-the-wall in nyc . lately , for some reason , i 've been wanting to try more . i
3 when i want to splurge on eating out , this is one of the few places my boyfriend and i can agree on . i put up with the noisy , cramped , uber trendy dining experience just to eat a `` delux burger . '' gruyere cheese , caramelized
3 i like their burrito <unk> cruz . my boyfriend loves their blueberry pancakes . yeah , first watch is usually full of old people , but it 's nice to take a break from the tragically hip <unk> that never learned quite how to use their ` indoor voices .
4 i have to give it 5 stars even though i am sometimes frustrated by the seating -lrb- not stadium style , so if you 're watching a <unk> film and you 're stuck behind someone tall ... it sucks -rrb- . they show excellent movies and the crowd is generally
2 is that an airplane hangar or a really bad baseball stadium ? while i 'm a big fan of chase field 's retractable roof , cleanliness , air conditioning and swimming pool , the stadium is lacking on aesthetic appeal . i find it rather ugly , <unk> , cavernous
2 i find the sushi here to be run-of-the-mill . the i-17 / <unk> strip mall restaurant is kind of quiet and subdued compared to the scottsdale joints , and i like it that way . i come here when i want something dependable in the central phoenix area without driving
1 they should change their name to fresh , easy and fatty . are you kidding me ? after all the rave reviews of fresh and easy , i waited for the dust to settle and ventured there today only to find it is a major disappointment . i find this
3 i freely admit that i am a cookie whore . imagine the cookie monster <unk> up and walking van buren . yep , that would be me - doing anything for a cookie . or maybe that makes me a cookie hooker , a <unk> <unk> perhaps ? anyhow ,
4 this is some classy brunch . i love it . hot damn , it was warm this morning , but not enough to make a difference on a 5-star place like the farm at south mountain . i was in a rush to try this place out this weekend before
4 like <unk> <unk> says `` do n't hate the playa , hate the game . '' well that <unk> pretty much sums up my feeling on caffe boa and their dynamite happy hour deals . it 's a great day when you can meet up with friends after work on
3 wow -- cheap , delicious , ok service , and upscale arcadia vibe inside . i 'm sold . i 'm aware of the complaints of the tempe location , so i 'm on guard . although it 's newly opened , i will def . go back to try
4 chimayo chicken , <unk> and the corner circular booth by the seductive fireplace . five stars . i finally made it here the other night . an attempt to go here last summer was <unk> by a kitchen fire . needless to say , the blue crab tostadas also impressed
2 good food here at phoenicia . but aloof , questionable and almost dismissive service kind of ruins an ordinarily positive experience . like others say in their reviews the chicken shawerma and accompanying garlic sauce were pretty good . i found the chicken to be a bit greasy and a
2 i 'd really like to like this place more than i do . central phoenix noticeably lacks italian restaurants -lrb- if you 're not counting oregano 's and pizza places -rrb- , and harley 's italian bistro is in a great <unk> stretch of 7th ave -lrb- melrose on 7th
2 wow , it must be a first-time mall experience for the reviewer before me . five stars for arrowhead ? are you kidding ? i find this mall to be average and boring with many middle of the road stores -lrb- dillards , sears , gap , <unk> 's ,
2 i really want to like six more than i did , but i determined it was n't for me when i realized i was ignorant of the six restroom culture and <unk> . excuse moi . it had nothing to do with the tempe 12 calendar babe celebration going on

2 greek <unk> aside , i find king gyros to be a good cheap lunch grub type of place . it 's a counter style lunch joint -lrb- <unk> in the <unk> 's shopping center -rrb- with tacky greek beach posters on the wall , classroom carpet , <unk> tables and

1 the service here is horrible . i know the menu better than most of the employees , they rarely come by the table to check on you , often times i feel ignored , and their food is moderately so-so . all of the issues i have with this location

4 ho lee cow ! the food is diverse and amazing - but lets face it , you come here for the service ! this place is a classy establishment that caters to the upper crust of scottsdale . the food is pricey , but the total package is worth the
3 we had my daughters 9th birthday party here . amazing ! everyone -lrb- adults and kids -rrb- had a blast for less than $ 200 . staff is pretty responsive and attentive too .
2 i stopped in for lunch as i was in the area and had some time to kill . i was pleasantly surprised by the ambience and the food at the brio . it is across the street from kierland commons in the scottsdale quarter , and kind of out of
2 we were hungry for pizza , and decided to try sauce . we really did n't know what to expect , as were just in the area , and had heard of it before . when you enter , there is a menu on the wall that you read while

1 what can you say about this place ? i was in the area , in the middle of the day , and thirsty . i had never heard of the tilted kilt before , so i thought - an irish pub !! all right !! i went in - and
4 i like it , i really like it !!! i am a very simple eater , i like good food , and want it to be reasonably priced . i do not like pretentious restaurants , which are `` in '' for a couple of months , and then change
2 i love <unk> and have been going there regularly for years . why only three stars then ? over the past year and a half the service has gone downhill . i find that the servers are impersonal and <unk> , and sometimes a little pompous . after three or

3 as a la native i have had the famous roscoes chicken & waffles , this is better . i never thought i would ever say that . every time i come here we come in a big group , they are really accommodating and quick with the food . the
2 perfect place for <unk> ingredients . there are a variety of meats but the prices are sky high . i usually come here for the sauces and panko . there are also fresh korean pan <unk> .
3 one night i was suddenly craving for some garlic naan . we came across this place and decided to try out the buffet . it went beyond my expectations , very authentic . the price is really good too for all the food you can get . the garlic naan
3 i am a big fan of their bruschetta , very unique that they put ingredients other than the boring old tomatoes on top . they have a lot of different wines and craft beers . there is also a really good happy hour which is good for celebrations with a
4 finally made it back and checked out the coach outlet , omg <unk> !!! it now seems i need to get a 2nd job just to support my every growing want of every coach bag i see !!
2 it 's a friends 40th birthday party , and how do her friends do it , hooked her up with a suite and throw her a party ! the suite , was clean and nice , living room area in the front , bathroom area splits the middle back half

3 been living in the valley for ten years now , have driven past fajitas a million times , it was n't until jan this year that i ventured into the joint with some friends who gave this place 2 thumbs up ! let me tell ya i was n't let
3 its tuesday , day after a holiday and we are just slammed at work , so some coworkers and i thought ahead and picked a place or order lunch from and pick it up and bring it back to the office . today the vote was for oregano 's ,

2 tried out the `` d '' -lsb- dinner -rsb- recently for the first time here . well when you first walk in , it has a trendy but very casual atmosphere . we went here for dinner around 8pm and it was pretty empty . we sat at the bar
3 second time trying out a restaurant at cityscape and first time at a fox concept restaurant . verdict : 4 stars . this is an upscale bar type of american restaurant that serves many dishes only found in upper end restaurants . a variety of cheese , fondue appetizers ,
3 best chinese food i have had in arizona that is not dim sum . this newly opened george & son chinese & asian cuisine restaurant is next to the amc deer valley movie theater , and they already have another restaurant by the same name in scottsdale -lrb- same recipes
4 really good people here ! the food is also very good . try the huevos rancheros for breakfast and the chipotle chicken sandwich at lunchtime . good coffee and very reasonable prices .
2 the margaritas are absolutely awesome here ! no sweet and sour mix , just good old fashioned squeezed lime and good quality tequila ... beautiful . the margarita with `` attitude '' is probably my favorite with just a hint of jalapeo and some cilantro , <unk> a wonderful balance
4 yasu has quickly become my favorite place in town . the food is 100 % legit ! the regular menu is really fun , but the menu of chef 's features is the way to go . i can not over emphasize the importance of eating here at least once
4 kale . turkey burger . sweet potatoes . need i say more ? i 'm in love with this place . awesome location , awesome food ... the staff is extremely friendly and so is the management . i 'm already planning my next trip back !
4 this is a great place to go rock climbing . the staff is very helpful and the environment is very relaxed . plenty of room to do your own thing , and a number of great <unk> for any skill set . ca n't wait to go back !
4 cheap drinks , cheap pool . amazing bar food ... best in town . i do n't know which chef they have locked up back there , but they bring out some amazing food . certainly unexpected ... but it keeps me coming back .
2 meh . not impressed . true food ... good . <unk> ... great . this place ... meh . i can think of 100 other places i 'd rather drop $ 30 on food for just myself .
2 a bit overpriced , i think . it 's really good ... but not 5-star amazing . i 've gone here many times before , and i 'll come back eventually . this is a great place to take a date , but some of the seating is just awful
4 after having stayed in italy for a <unk> study abroad , i was terribly sad not to find anything that compared . and then i came here and man , it blew almost everything else out of the water , even some restaurants in italy . the wine is served
4 mmmmm the u.s. egg is absolute greatness , what denny 's could be if it only tried a lot harder . get the protein pancakes . even if you do n't necessarily want protein pancakes at that time , get them , take them home , put em in the
3 a manager from kona recently contacted me to apologize and express his thanks for my feedback . he sounded genuinely surprised by my experience which leads me to believe this was a <unk> type of mistake by the staff on that particular day . as a result , i decided
3 we need more places like this in scottsdale . i stopped in for breakfast saturday morning . ordered the lox and bagel ... fantastic ! and a great value . other reviewers have suggested that <unk> is rather pricey but i disagree . the lox and bagel with fountain drink
3 i took my father and little brother here last week . all three of us had fantastic dinners . my brother had of all things one of the best filet mignon 's i have tasted in a long time . my father had a side dish of phenomenal asparagus spears
4 best urban park in america ! a few tips ... uphill hikers have the right of way , some of them may be timing their <unk> so it 's important let them pass during narrow sections of the trail . parking for the echo canyon trailhead is a major hassle
4 what a great time ! i came here for a birthday party with about a dozen friends last monday night . a nearby giants spring training game had just <unk> so we were very fortunate to have had reservations . apparently this is a favorite spot for baseball fans as
2 i am torn between three and four stars on this one . the food is decent but the portions are a little small for these prices . the small portions are somewhat <unk> by the various side dishes that are included in many of the menu items . i also
4 ... love this place ! ... out of all of the chinese buffet places i 've been to , this one has been the best , with the biggest selection ! ... lots of booths to sit at . the food is always good .
0 the food here is garbage ... del taco is better ! bad service , very noisy ! long wait ! cramped <unk> top things off , there was an old bush <unk> in the lobby ! are you kidding me ??
4 always good ! ... portions are big ! ... great spacious place , lots of tables . ... always a reliable place for some good chinese food ! ; p
1 this place is falling apart ... outdated
4 this yogurt place next door to hula 's on central the flavors were all good , & the yogurt was that high-quality creamy kind , not that <unk> ice milk garbage . they offered many different toppings ! we are definately coming back & i highly recommend this place !
3 happy hour prices are good - get a domestic beer for $ 2-3 . the staff seems friendly and the sweet potato fries are yummy . did n't stay too long so that 's all i can report for now .
3 went here on a saturday night ; the place was pretty busy . we ordered food around 9pm so the kitchen stays open late so that is a plus . we got a burger and sweet potato fries - both very good . try the sweet <unk> fries with the
2 stopped in here on a saturday and it had a decent crowd . i like the small patio where you can enjoy the great phoenix weather . the location is good too - in downtown near a lot of the sports venues etc. .
2 the food here is good but the service can be hit or miss and they sometimes seem to <unk> with large groups . i like this place because it 's close and they have a good happy hour . the outdoor patio is nice too but during a recent visit
2 look just because the place is in the ghetto does n't mean it is going to be automatically good . i grew up a couple of miles from here and we have been coming here for ages . the rice and beans are decent but not the most awesome thing
0 staff was friendly and it was busy , but they were definitely limited in their selection . i have never been to a buffalo exchange with such a little selection and what there was available was just meh , i 've seen better . the clothes to pick from were
3 i love getting my pirate booty from here -lrb- the puffs people -rrb- and the ready made pizzas , pretty much everything that they have ready made is really good . the store can get pretty crowded , especially during the dinner hour rush . employees are friendly and i
2 park near the lights people ! where zia used to cut through the mall , they are now closed . however , forever 21 does the same thing so you do n't have to walk all around the mall . plus you can pick up some goodies while you are
0 we were debating between coming here or going to our old favorite : <unk> 's just down the street . since we found <unk> 's by <unk> this place a year ago , we decided to try this place out for dinner just to see if we were missing anything
0 one of the most aggravating restaurants i have been to in awhile . my partner and i were so irritated that we both got into an argument we were so irritated . first arrive and there is a woman sitting behind the front counter and she does not greet us
4 i started going to postino for their amazing monday and tuesday bottle and a board deal . i was pretty much in love with postino upon my first visit , and thus , malbec monday was born . how could you hate a monday when you know your day will
3 here 's the deal . fate is costly . the drinks are costly . the food is costly . the atmosphere , quality , and service are priceless . i do n't mind waiting forever for something that is worthwhile and fate is . i have only been disappointed in
3 the skeptical chymist is a great north scottsdale bar for happy hour or dinner/drinks before going out . i went a few weeks ago with a group of friends where we did just that . we all bellied up to the bar which probably wasnt the most ideal spot for
3 i * heart * nellos . whatever location , the food seems to be consistently great , and if you 've read my review of the old town location you know that my heart really belongs there at that location . things that i dont like about this mcclintock and
3 attention <unk> state fans !!! owned by a michigan native , <unk> is the best place to watch any michigan sport . college to professional , if its being <unk> , it will be on at upper deck . both the michigan and michigan state alumni clubs meet there for
2 trendy trendy trendy . in other words : a <unk> long wait to sit down , much too loud music , shitty parking -lrb- i had my car towed out of a lot there once so beware , they show no mercy -rrb- , stiff but pricey drinks , and
3 i am very convinced that there is no such thing as a sports bar with good service in scottsdale . dukes is no exception . i went to dukes last sunday for the chargers game and it was packed . i was pretty happy to see a sports bar within
3 there is no bad pizza ... i just moved to phoenix from brooklyn , so what do i go for on the first night i 'm here ? i go for a taste of home . i go for some ` <unk> . i was on my way to the
2 the only reason i ended up here was because i was hoping to go to roy 's for some ono . but , oh , no ! roy 's is gone and taberna is now in its place -lrb- note for those who use google maps -rrb- . i liked
4 if you 're afraid of a sticky floor , or domestic beers , or leather couches , this is not the venue for you . however , if you 're not a princess , and you like to play pool , listen to some classic rock on the jukebox and
3 so , this is owned by the guy who owns stumpy 's down the block , and i want it to succeed , because i think he 's a good dude who always greets customers and seems genuinely concerned about all of us . i dropped in for happy hour
3 if there 's something not to like about the yard , i do n't know what it is . oh , yeah . my bad . i do know what it is . it 's the parking <unk> . painful waits to park or exit when it 's busy ,
2 <unk> staff at this small breakfast joints ... one totally overbearing and the other over the top nice but both in a <unk> , hyped up on <unk> kind of way . still there was a huge line at the breakfast club so we gave the dose a try .
2 this is a review for their breakfast not ice cream . we went here recently when the place we were heading to was closed and saw a sign that they do breakfast . well i guess they do but frankly they do n't really . they do the best an
3 excellent sandwiches and just about any other italian grocery item you can mention ! easy parking and friendly people too : -rrb-
1 i wanted to try another vietnamese place other than cyclo and friends suggested we try pho . well lesson learned . this place is no cyclo period . the food was just ok and while the service was friendly enough i could n't help but think it was all a
1 as we were at the montelucia resort for the night we figured we would check out their ` slow movement ' restaurant prado . well slow service just what we received . the place was busy -lrb- not jammed -rrb- and the waiters just could n't <unk> , the service
4 davanti <unk> joins the very small group of restaurants serving fine food in attractive surroundings at reasonable -lrb- sort of -rrb- prices . the cuisine is certainly italian , but not like what you would find in a traditional italian establishment -- this is more like what you would expect
1 the food is actually three star or maybe a bit better , and the ambience is okay . the problems : 1 . very expensive for what you get . 2 . a wait staff that <unk> you to death . i 've been to a number of brazilian steak
3 i almost desperately want to give north five stars , because the food is really something special , but it has one huge problem -- its very , very noisy -lrb- outside may be better if it is cool enough -rrb- . about the food - traditional italian fare is
2 hands down , the best part about this place is the patio . it 's cozy with a large brick fireplace , <unk> trees , and <unk> of white <unk> lights ! the restaurant actually opens out to the patio . this place is high end and the prices show
2 typical scottsdale tavern . upscale enough to be called a scottsdale restaurant . our waiter was very impatient and did n't have much information for us about the food . luckily , the burger we ordered was quite delicious , as well as the fries . expensive though . not
4 so i have n't been here for the food quite yet , though i plan on going very very soon ! my boyfriend and i went here because a couple of bartenders at other restaurants had recommended their cocktails . we went on a super busy saturday night , but
3 it 's been on my mind to try this place and when a friend invited us to a birthday party at the clarendon , it seemed like the perfect opportunity . the restaurant itself was quite cute . the house margaritas are outstanding and clearly not from a big plastic
3 always reliably good . great beer selection as well as fabulous `` bitch fizz '' -lrb- <unk> , etc. -rrb- and cocktails . their pizza is outstanding and they have a healthy menu . i generally steer clear of chains but this is an exception .
3 we are at the esplanade frequently and this place has caught my eye a number of times . when a coupon came up , i jumped on it and we went . the value of the coupon was terrific - appetizers , main dishes , desserts , and a bottle
3 i 'll admit ... when a friend picked this as a place for dinner , i was dubious given the 3 <unk> awarded by yelp . however , i was pleasantly surprised . we arrived early and opted to sit at the bar for a bit . margaritas were quite
3 upon moving to az , we tried z ` tejas and i was not a fan . i ca n't say why exactly - the food just did n't do much for me . i gave it another shot recently and i 'm a convert ! my smoked chicken quesadilla
0 here 's a novel idea : open a comedy club with food that does n't come from the freezer section of costco . anyone ? anyone ? <unk> ? i had high hopes for the `` new and improved '' tempe improv . i love love love stand-up comedy but
3 this is definitely a hidden neighborhood gem . it reminds me of haji baba in tempe - part grocery store , part delicious eats . the gentleman behind the counter -lrb- <unk> the owner ? -rrb- was extremely friendly and welcoming . we ordered the chicken kabobs and the vegetarian
1 i will preface this review by saying that this is our absolute favorite theater and i can not remember the last time we saw a movie at a different theater . this past tuesday night , however , was a bust . we arrived at the theater 20 minutes early
3 it 's free now ! free stuff = good . i 've only been a handful of times but they seem to favor contemporary art -lrb- which is my preference -rrb- . it 's a great place to spend a hot phoenix afternoon . did i mention it 's free
4 let 's just say 4 friends were slightly inebriated after a gin mixology class . and let 's just say that those 4 friends decided to stay for dinner at lon 's . and we 'll also say -lrb- <unk> , of course -rrb- that those 4 friends might have
3 beautiful resort that you can take out of town visitors to for fine dining , drinks and spectacular <unk> !
4 incredible happy hour at the bar ! the burgers are delicious as are the bbq shrimp !
2 new location 3 star quality food .
3 their smoothies are divine and any soup there is delicious !
3 oysters are always fresh and flavorful here ! the fish and chips are under 10 dollars and are enough for two full meals !
3 great food and a good place to go after the old town farmers ' market . the guacamole is delicious and not over-rated . they know how to make a great margarita here !
3 parking is limited but street parking is plentiful . you can see your food prepared in their open kitchen . try any of their tacos !
3 great place to go with out of towners after a downtown game ! the drinks here are better than the bar food !
2 it 's okay . i think there are cheaper and higher quality vegan foods at whole foods ! if it were n't so close to the asu campus and scottsdale , it would n't be that busy !
4 the workers here are nothing like the <unk> , hipster <unk> at other pita jungles -- they are actually nice ! they let me order from the kids menu and i got a chicken pita , hummus and drink for 5 bucks plus tax ! i will be back !
3 i am a fan . this small taco shop that is family owned is just the right kind of place to go for lunch for some fast very good mexican food . do n't go in thinking that its going to be a sit down place that will serve you
4 the very best breakfast in town . very big portion and the atmosphere is great , farmhouse kitchen table . five stars for every aspect of my first trip there . i promise you will not regret it . if you go on the weekend you will wait in line
3 i got a piece of red velvet cake . the frosting is so rich and creamy with a very buttery finish and lots of cream cheese . the cake is tasty but dry . good thing there was lots of amazing frosting to cover that flaw up . the place
4 cupcakes are to die for ! butter creme frosting is the best in town . i do n't see how anyone can not love this place . yes the cupcakes are a lil overpriced 3.25 a piece but its totally a little bit of heaven . i took my grandma
2 its ok . i had the red chili plate . one of those deals where the cook should taste their food before it goes out for the day because the red chili was awful . the meat was fatty and of low quality . the seasonings were bland and no
2 kiss the cook is one of those places where it seems like a 50/50 chance that you will either have a good experience or an ok one . judging by the initial reviews you would think this place is the go to breakfast place . that is n't the case
3 food : this place has some pretty good middle eastern food . the hummus was awesome , and the <unk> are always tasty . you get a lot of food on your plate . the meat is actually tasty , as opposed to a lot of places that just throw
3 3.5 stars food : i love my sandwiches , and dilly 's always satisfies me . the sandwiches are pretty big . i like the smokey mountain because any sandwich with bacon in it is twice as good as those without ! i think you get a free cookie with
3 is there a better meal than breakfast ? i think not ... any so , we have sort of made it a weekly tradition to have breakfast at the place . my better half had eaten there prior to it moving to its new location , and i had never
1 i love four peaks . what i do n't love is scottsdale . or the people who <unk> it , really . including the servers . i 've been a fan of fp for a long time . great food , incredible beer , and great times . on this
2 pretty good , but something 's missing . it 's like going on a date with someone good looking , but totally lacking in personality . i feel as if i should like gb , but there 's just no spark between us . i do n't know if it
3 i really like ohso ! i love the huge and locally focused beer selection , i love the bike theme , i love the the way they embrace the canal , -lrb- coolest fence ever !! -rrb- i love the dog friendliness and i love the food ! with all
0 a very important indicator of mexican food is the beans . unfortunately , teepee served up <unk> , dry beans . a 2nd indicator is the margaritas . a drink with patron should have a bit of kick ; the bartender had a second chance to get it right -
4 understated decor matches simple flavorful dishes . great service and new bar area could prove popular . not for hearty eaters but still proves satisfying . all dishes were inspiring : home made mozzarella , raw fish , and gnocchi . every dish offered new <unk> into refreshing favors .
3 part of the initial thrill was beating the rush . however , the waiter 's control and pace of service let us savor the <unk> november day , and the mexican eats , on their fun patio . salsa is unique and has great kick , served with homemade chips
2 we had an indulgent friday and had appetizers with drinks at the pizzeria -lrb- trattoria -rrb- then moved on to a different restaurant for more <unk> . this location may stay as a good lunch location as it was way too stiff and really loud for a relaxing dinner .
3 happy hour provides nice value with filling , satisfying small plates : pork tostadas are incredible and have no comparison with a few of our fav mexican eateries . we are keeping our fingers crossed not to get the waiter again who is skimping on hair ties .
1 went to taylor 's cafe for a fear that the line at lgo and over easy would be too long . i wish i would have waited in line . the place was pretty empty so you would have thought our sever would have been a little more attentive .
3 since our first visit to joyride taco house on july 7th we have been there numerous times . we are huge fans of upward projects restaurants . it 's one of those restaurants where you just like `` being '' there . great music , great service , yummy food
2 let me start by saying , any business i come across is usually <unk> against a socal equivalent . why is that you ask ? because socal sets the standard . this may be an unfair advantage but i 'd like to think , i 've come across the best
4 never disappointed . everything about this place rocks ! they are very accommodating to dietary needs and every meal is exceptional . they have a band that plays on the weekends . great for groups or date nights .
3 yay ! rejoice ! there is finally a foodie spot in south scottsdale less than a mile away from me that brings some hipster cred to the corner of hayden and thomas roads . the pig & pickle just opened , serving up a <unk> dinner menu paired with a
2 it seems like dine-in theaters are popping up all over the valley these days . studio movie grill in north scottsdale recently opened . the theater has a far less luxurious feel than the amc esplanade 14 or even ipic theaters . instead of comfy reclining seats , you 're
2 if you 're not a fan of spicy food , stay away from phoenix 's los dos molinos . the new mexican restaurant `` does n't know how to make mild , '' meaning the salsas and sauces will burn your tongue off if you 're weak like me .
3 i had the time of my life at the remodeled scottsdale lanes bowling alley near my house . my pals and i cosmic bowled for about three hours , for $ 16 a person . -lrb- shoe rental is included . -rrb- the lanes have come a long way since
4 love this theater for independent films !
2 i 'm always up for trying some handmade italian food , and i went to la <unk> for the first time . the north scottsdale spot is pretty from the outside , with <unk> lights adorning the exterior of the restaurant . inside , the spot is really nice ,
3 it is rare to find a drive-through that actually serves healthy food . thank you , 32 shea , for bringing fast and nutritious food to those in a hurry in the north phoenix area . i 've never actually ordered food from the drive-through myself , but every time
3 that 's a wrap in phoenix is awesome . the eco - and vegetarian-friendly spot serves up wraps , bowls and salads using fresh ingredients -lrb- mmm , avocado . -rrb- my friends got the veggie jackson -lrb- includes <unk> , feta and salsa -rrb- and the prince of thai
4 really great fro-yo , and this place is spotless !!! staff is very friendly , too . great location , too . introduced to this place via groupon , but i will keep coming back !
4 this place is incredible . it 's one of those places you would never know was there unless you knew it was there . they have an enormous menu , although i 've only been there at lunch time . i always get the greek salad , and it <unk>
3 i was thrilled that two places i 'd bookmarked from yelp were in the same strip mall ! after my <unk> , i walked down to mama java 's for an iced coffee . the inside of this place was very cute -- very funky coffeehouse . the guy working
3 the orange blossom beer is the best ! i 've never tried the food here , only the beers . i love that you can get a growler of your favorite to take with you .
3 oh sam fox , i love you . i am a huge fan of the culinary confections that you whip up and have never been disappointed when dining at a frc restaurant . culinary dropout is no exception . i have been here several times , for drinks and appetizers
3 i have been wanting to try this place for a while now and my husband and i went here for a date night on friday . i like the look of the place . when we arrived there were a lot of people in the bar area , but not
1 honestly came here only to prove that the husband and i could make it in and out without being <unk> ... we did . there were 3 cops and 3 <unk> <unk> outside due to the <unk> that have occurred recently . this place is n't my scene , but
2 this place has yummy burgers and onion rings and is really clean ! they usually have a special burger every month or so , but one of my favorites is the bbq bacon burger with cheese . yum !
3 still giving it four stars and i 've eaten here four times since the first time i reviewed this places . i really like everything i 've had , but my favorite is one that my husband got the last time : sweet curry with nuts . he likes nuts
3 i love it because i can wear <unk> , a t-shirt , jeans , sit outside and drink good beer . super easy going and a huge patio make it a favorite of mine . as a bonus , the food is really good , too . between the hummus
0 i thought this was a decent sports bar , so i met my husband and some friends here for lunch on the friday of the first round of the ncaa tournament . we were the only table of people inside and there were maybe 10 other people in the entire
3 for $ 5.99 for daily lunch specials , sylvia you are the bomb . kudos for the shredded beef and <unk> taco . i split your meal into lunch and dinner - and i 'm still full ! you are minus a star because you gave me heartburn - your
4 came here yet again for happy hour and to check out some flamenco dancing -lrb- they offer it every wednesday evening -rrb- and it was beyond amazing . the sangria was so-so ... a little too sweet for my taste . i stuck to my jack and cokes ... and
3 bacon ! bacon ! and more bacon ! even the donuts are made out of bacon . it is really quite good though not <unk> so . -2 stars if you are a vegetarian .
1 beautiful place , mediocre food . frustrating since i drive past it every week wishing we had a great mexican place in the neighborhood . nearby juan jaime 's is better and cheaper with <unk> the attitude .
3 loved it ! half expected a lame pf chang wannabe so was very surprised at how excellent and fun it was ! specials were terrific and cheap , and the bartender paul made us some of the better drinks i 've had in town .
3 my favorite is still the one on shea but this is also great . kids meal ca n't be beat . fattoush salad is great , so is the black bean burger -lrb- just add sriracha -rrb- . tapas portions at happy hour look great , but we always forget
4 damn that green flannel is great . it has corn beef , potatoes , fresh jalapenos , and green peppers . even something normally as pedestrian as english muffins are great -lrb- tip , make yourself a flannel english muffin sandwich -rrb- . food is terrific and so are the
2 too loud again ! is like a disco in here . is this a nightclub ? was having a relaxing time here until the music got loud . i used to go here twice a week . but have n't been back in months . just got too annoyed with
4 there are seriously some mornings in my house where my family will look at <unk> ... say , `` donuts ? '' and we all magically know that this donut craving ca n't be satiated by simply dunkin . though these mornings are few and far between because my family
4 i 'm a pretty big snob when it comes to mexican food since i was raised on the good stuff . the other day i had to have a burrito . i do n't know why but nothing else would satisfy me . it had to be a bean burrito
4 i 'm not a fan of buffets at all , but for pink pepper i always make an exception . the food is amazing and even worth the lunch price if you only get one plate ! dinner is a little expensive but the food is still just as wonderful
4 just went there yesterday and the guy behind the counter was so helpful and nice . my mom and dad had never had jewish food before so he explained very politely what was in <unk> and even let us try things that we were n't sure about . absolutely excellent
0 my friend joan was going to meet me at <unk> in scottsdale on monday , but luckily , we both noticed that it 's closed on monday so we ended up meeting at nick 's at tatum and shea . we go where we have groupons , etc. and she
4 can not say enough good about this place . i love it . i love it ! i simply love it ! we have always had really great service and the food ! well , the chips are thin and salty <unk> and i love the salsa . they keep
1 my daughter is nine and already very serious about her art . we 've been trying to get her to all the happening art venues in the area ... so we got our culture pass for smoca and ventured forth . we went on a thursday , so we did
2 some really nice stores but all the one 's you find in pretty much every mall in america . the great news is the area is aesthetically pleasing . there are some <unk> known restaurants and everything is outside so it 's easier to get closer to the business you
4 so , i have been to joe 's two more times and each time i had the grilled chicken with pecan pesto sandwich . i have increased my rating from 4 to 5 stars based on the absolute <unk> of said chicken sandwich . wow . go . get it
4 we eat here at least twice a week . the gyro pita is excellent , moist and tender meat . the lamb souvlaki is another favorite , have the cook it how the house likes it . the chicken souvlaki has awesome , almost indian flavor , i love it
4 this place is always a family favorite . the kids love the butter noodles and pizza . my wife likes the spanakopita , gyro pitta , grilled chicken salad , greek salad and beet salad -lrb- which is a special from time to time -rrb- . i have a too
1 i have been to bld 4 times and i have to say it is kind of a wreck . it is an `` upscale diner '' in a place filled with casual dining . it is overly complicated and expensive . my first <unk> was a happy hour that did
2 i really do not get all of the hype . the overall meal was okay . <unk> portion and very pricey . the dessert was pretty good but not worth the overall cost of the bill . my recommendation is to go for dessert only .
3 went to this place for happy hour and found they had some great drink and food specials . the food can be expensive but its good . the beers are good but i would not recommend getting the tasters . all of the beer <unk> were american beers you could
2 great happy hour place for fun and relaxation for co-workers . it is pricey if you go before happy hour starts . they occasionally have live music too if that is your bag -lrb- not mine -rrb- . but not bad for being located in the middle of nowhere .
4 this place is fantastic !! its not only a market , its also a restaurant , their beef shawerma is unbelievable ! and their service is great , if you shopping for <unk> arabic food you can find almost anything there , from tahini to <unk> * traditional <unk> food
3 excellent atmosphere ... great place for a date as well ! pizza was delicious and needless to say the nutella calzone was yummy ! what stuck out the most , again was the atmosphere . . i really enjoyed it !
3 six is not the greatest club , actually its not really a club its more a lounge , i have given up on all the scottsdale clubs now that i 'm a bit older , but if i do go to old town six and pcl and maybe crown room
2 i loved this place when i was pregnant . now , not so much . it just tastes very bland . it reminds me of chipotle . i like chipotle better unfortunatly . must have been the pregnant <unk> !!!
3 i like this place . it 's a fun atmosphere , the bartender is really friendly and fun . the shots ` banana <unk> suckers ' are soooo good .
2 yummy salads and very thin crust pizza . probably the most thin crust i have ever had . the salads are all fresh which i love . this is a great spot for lunch or a light dinner .
3 my husband and i decided to try this place since it was minutes from our home . we were not disappointed ! we ordered a few rolls ; the crazy california which was pretty good , the amigo and the arizona were our favorites though . the rolls are smaller
1 not good and overpriced . one of my friends hyped this place up so i was excited to try it and it was a huge let down . i will not be going back .
3 petsmart is like shopping at walmart ... do you grocery shop at walmart ? if you do , then you probably feed your dog gravy train ... im sure you and your family are healthy , fit and well adjusted . chances are you dont yelp , so this isnt
4 once upon a time there was a restaurant named vig . it lived in arcadia . it wanted to be cool , but was only half cool because it was constantly <unk> by the evil <unk> of douche bags named <unk> . then one day vig met a better neighborhood
0 <unk> ... here we go . this place has pretty decent food . its not terrible at all . however , the place claims to be healthy and fresh ... i have a fundamental problem with a place that uses styrofoam plates , styrofoam cups , styrofoam to-go containers and
2 ohhhh suburbia . only you would have a sushi place with the chairs up on the tables at <unk> on a saturday night . i stopped by to check this place out after some christmas shopping errands , around 9:30 this saturday . being a fan of sushi and craft
1 i found the service here attentive and timely , but have to share some sentiments with other unimpressed yelpers about the mediocrity of the dining experience . i was introduced to fuego bistro by my roommate who had purchased a groupon without knowing anything about the restaurant . it has
4 hands down my favorite bookstore in tempe ! i picked up a couple of unique <unk> here , `` not your mother 's slow <unk> '' and `` a passion for cheese '' . better yet , they were both marked down . it is definitely worth perusing the outdoor
3 just had to try this place when i heard it was <unk> fusion and was featured on <unk> with guy fieri . i will admit that i studied up beforehand , since some very <unk> yelpers mentioned the <unk> of the ordering system . it was worth walking through their
4 diggity dank <unk> ! i 've been frequenting the food truck fridays for lunch at phoenix public market recently and finally made it back around to sample another short leash dog . originally , i tried the beer hot sausage , aiko style -lrb- mango chutney and other goodies -rrb-
4 i heard about this <unk> underground seafood restaurant by chance and i made a mental note of it . my roommate picked up on it when i explained , as best i could , that this place is essentially a parking lot with a restaurant underneath it . and apparently
4 at another recent trip to humble pie after work with friends , i was introduced to a slightly off-menu item that has to be tried to be appreciated . order the garlic & potato pizza and then ask them to include pancetta as a topping . the combination of all
0 this used to be my favorite restaurant ! i 've introduced my mom , my boyfriend , a few friends and cousins to this place because i am absolutely in love with the mediterranean wrap with cashew cheese ! yum ! and , the salad that you can order with
4 i had the no cheese pizza . it was really good . i was impressed by the organic options including the <unk> certified organic soda . loved it . i will be back .
1 love that they have vegan options , love that they are educated about <unk> 's , food allergies , etc. and , i love their raw burger , well , i used to , i had it tonight and it was hard , like really hard . it used to
3 amado 's is bien by the rue amado 's you are bien , i am not <unk> to say so , you 're not quite muy bien , but no one has to know . the amado 's platter , is a lot of food and cheap , for breakfast
3 spicey pei wei by the rue i had pei wei for lunch today , it was n't the best dish , next time i think i 'll say , i prefer somewhere with fish . i got the spicey chicken pei wei plate , with brown rice , not white
1 <unk> sam can by the rue i did n't have my toes in the water , i did n't have my ass in the sand , my baja burrito was almost okay , the flavor for the most part , bland . the best thing i can offer up to
2 we got a piper down ! by the rue for lunch today was the tilted kilt , i arrived in a car and not on <unk> , this is not the house that peter built , when i play pinball i never <unk> ! my opinion it 's a two
3 i went here for lunch the other day and was impressed . this place is expensive , and the menu and design look like this place was meant to cater to upscale scottsdale women who do n't work and have the time and money to shop all day and eat
2 picked up a pizza after work the other day . it was alright . nothing special but not bad . we just got pepperoni since the girlfriend is fairly <unk> when it comes to toppings so maybe if i got a specialty pie i 'd like it more . i
4 if you want a great chicago hot dog and a great italian beef go to lukes . the fries are good too . friendly , quick service and great food combined with bears and cubs stuff everywhere . how can you beat this . this is the best comfort food
3 this place is great , it was the first place i dined when i moved to the valley and i continue to go back . the food is outstanding and the service is great . i always get the enchiladas and my girlfriend always goes with the salmon . she
3 went here last thursday after work for dinner and drinks with some coworkers and my immediate thought was i 've found football heaven . there are more tv 's in here than an best buy and not a bad seat in the house . for that fact alone i will
3 another busy in-n-out , but with fairly speedy service and consistent food . our orders came out exactly as described . one minor detail was that the burgers were stacked <unk> in our to-go bag , which made the condiments slide to the bottom of the burger when we came
4 i love the original paletas betty in chandler , and was excited to see they had opened up another shop on mill . they are open late at this location -lrb- until midnight -rrb- which is very nice if you are craving late night dessert ! on some days this
3 mekong plaza is home to a great supermarket , and some good asian restaurants . there are also some shops that sell clothes , a kids store , a dental office , and a realtor to name a few . my favorite place to get food here is the mekong
2 american fare , serving your standard salads , burgers , sandwiches . you wo n't really find any surprises here . what they lack in menu <unk> is made up somewhat in preparation . i had a sandwich and tried some of the salmon salad . both were very good
3 delicious breakfast/brunch with an emphasis on <unk> products . the sweet potato tots , like everyone says , are quite tasty . i tried the hawaiian breakfast -lrb- $ 11 -rrb- which came out on a fancy , modern white bowl , quite possibly the most chic looking breakfast i
1 probably the worst tasting stuffed cabbage i 've ever had . it was <unk> sweet -lrb- tasted sweeter than my soda ! -rrb- , and there were raisins in the tomato sauce which probably added to the sweetness . the ground meat on the inside on the other hand ,
3 look out calorie counters ! for some tasty chicago style fast food , you 've come to the right place . the set up seems exactly the same as the scottsdale location , which made navigating around the restaurant easy . options here include shakes , burgers , italian beef
3 yc 's is great in that you control the taste of your food . the downside of that however , is that if you do n't make a good flavorful combination , you 're stuck with it -lrb- unless you go <unk> -rrb- . at yc 's they have a
3 pretty tasty cuban food . the ropa vieja was flavorful , but a little tough . the chicken and pork were very good , marinated in tropical and spicy flavors the <unk> -lrb- <unk> in spanish -rrb- was excellent the sauce tasted a lot like hollandaise sauce though ? -lrb-
2 good lunch specials . for around $ 10 or less , you can choose from various lunch combos which include soup , salad , and rice . i had the ninja lunch combo which included teriyaki chicken , 3 pieces of california roll , one piece of shrimp tempura and
1 cute interior , decent food , but how can i actually receive the food if the waiter never comes to take my order ? we were seated and served water , and proceeded to wait ... and wait ... and wait ... while we saw both waiters serve other tables
3 went here for dinner and left very full and satisfied . the family that runs the restaurant is originally from globe so the mexican food here is similar to what you 'd find in the <unk> area . stepping into this restaurant , it feels similar to how other restaurants
3 a nice place for happy hour ! after watching a lovely show at the orpheum , we were feeling quite <unk> , so we headed over to partake in the discounted <unk> that the arrogant butcher had to offer . i also just wanted to eat here because i dig
2 the food was delicious , but the service , while enthusiastic , was slow . we had the tofu appetizer , which was very fresh and flavorful . i especially liked the tofu with the truffle . we decided to get entrees rather than sushi for our meals , so
1 wow , this mall really went downhill ! way back when , this used to be the mall to shop at for families , teens , and young professionals alike . now it 's just a sad shell of its former self since the opening of the new shopping areas
3 solid choice for a good weekend buffet . the price on the weekends is $ 11.95 , and it includes soda , or one glass of champagne . weekday prices do not include drinks but are cheaper . the spread here had a nice variety of meaty and vegetarian dishes
1 meh . service was friendly , and the atmosphere is bright and festive , but it 's pretty americanized mexican food . i had a california burro -lrb- $ <unk> -rrb- , which was a large size , and tasted ok , but for about 1/3 of the price and
2 <unk> <unk> , if you usually talk like how i 'm <unk> ' right now , and you , like , wan na spend your time <unk> ' out and do n't mind <unk> ' ... and <unk> ... for your sammich , this is the place to be dudes
2 delicious tender salmon with a lot of flavor -lrb- $ 25 -rrb- . it had a nice , lightly breaded crust with lemon and herb , and the sides that came with it were rich and flavorful as well -lrb- buttered rice and roasted butternut squash -rrb- . a plus
3 i remember back when this place had its original name , <unk> croissants . i 'm glad that it 's still here offering buttery rich pastries and sandwiches . i stepped in and ordered an egg and cheese croissant and a bavarian cream . the croissants themselves were light ,
3 <unk> cafe is not a heart healthy cafe . bring that knowledge through the door and you will be served up a hearty filling breakfast , albeit a <unk> one . i had the spinach omelet -lrb- $ 6.99 -rrb- which came with hash browns or ranch potatoes , and
3 they are still coming out with great unique flavors such as root beer , animal cookie , and oreo brownie , and they have a wonderful seasonal pumpkin fro-yo . they offer small frozen cups of <unk> dessert for your dog -lrb- $ 2 -rrb- , so we sat on
3 mojo yogurt is one of my favorite frozen yogurt places in the valley . they have a good selection of flavors , and i like their original tart the best out of all the yogurt places i 've tried here in arizona . also , the toppings are always fresh
2 went for lunch on a sunday . it was very busy , with a lot of the <unk> college crowd here for the game . we had a large party , and the person organizing our get-together tried to call an hour before we arrived to put our name on
2 food , drink , and gaming , what a perfect combo ! we 've been here a few times , mainly to run around and pretend like you 're a kid again at the arcade . there are a plethora of games to choose from , whether you like games
3 there 's a weird disconnect with me when i walk into this museum to see instruments , whose sole purpose is to be played and enjoyed , displayed for you to stare at while they stay silent . granted , i 'm sure a lot of these instruments are not
3 cute little cozy eatery serving up what 's the best and freshest at the moment . from the <unk> menu outside to the picturesque garden exterior , cafe monarch is a little gem in the heart of downtown scottsdale . it was a lovely late saturday morning when we ate
4 <unk> cuisine at its finest . sochu house serves up innovative <unk> asian bites , as well as larger entrees and noodle dishes . the cuisine spans several types of asian regions , with a hint of western influence . we ventured in on a sunday night for dinner .
3 great place to find more unusual spices from various parts of the world . from <unk> seed to <unk> berries , their selection ca n't be beat . for those that do n't want to make their own spice mixes , they also have pre-made spice mixes that are mixed
1 so imagine the following scenario : you are browsing the sunday paper and hurray ! you come across the <unk> , you save family circus for last because it is a classic and surely will not <unk> . you get through everything else and at long last come to the
4 i love me some ikea . a friend of mine once told me that ikea is gay mecca which makes me feel that they have spot on decorating -lrb- nothing wrong with positive stereotypes right ? -rrb- affordable and stylish and frankly a corporation that as far as i can
3 i actually really enjoy this place . it is a super cute resturaunt built from two old phoenix houses <unk> together . most of the food is not spectacular but never bad . the mizithra cheese however is so good , the chicken marsala , amazing and flavorful , and
4 i had to meet someone here because i had to interview him for this thing i am writing about him . you might have seen me . i was the guy dressed like <unk> david foster <unk> . the contract <unk> on a napkin and signed at the bar before
4 he confidently pushed the menu to the edge of the table with a hand <unk> , <unk> and bent by time and years of hard work fixing cars and pushing <unk> . `` i do n't need the menu . i have been coming here for 30 years and they
3 it 's weird that that the reviews are so skewed for capriottis sandwich shop . i have eaten here several times , and have enjoyed it each time . i think the thing that hurts them more than anything else is the `` best sandwich in america '' banner hanging
4 <unk> !!! i love mrs. white !!! -lrb- and her chicken -rrb- we actually saw a brief piece on the food tv channel about mrs. white -lrb- the best thing i ever ate show ... on fried chicken -rrb- . so we knew we had to go . we made
1 yay ... for a change what i think about a particular establishment seems to be in the majority ... so to keep my review `` brief '' , i will basically say that what all the other reviewers have written is exactly right ... for what is essentially a ``
4 i 've been going to lux for years . it 's always been # 1 . it is <unk> , painfully hip , but somehow it is n't uncomfortable there , and there really is n't a <unk> vibe that i have detected in my billion visits -lrb- oh and
4 this place is the best . first of all , nobody beats that $ 20 bruschetta and wine deal on mondays and tuesdays . the bruschetta is delicious , there 's a ton of it , and the wine does n't come from a `` bargain menu '' . this
2 i 've been meaning to go to the vig for ages . i finally got to go on friday , for a friend 's birthday . we ate elsewhere , then headed over to the vig for drinks . it 's a beautiful place ; <unk> it 's got a
3 i like carly 's . as mentioned , service is pretty lacking , but more in a , `` hey , man , what 's the rush '' way , as opposed to a `` eff you , you 'll get your food when you get it '' way .
2 hob nobs is completely unrecognizable from the old willo house ... and you know what ? that 's ok . let 's be honest . the willo house coffee really was n't very good , and the service was pretty lacking . so i 'm over it . on to
4 whenever i 'm at any of our locally owned places like fez , switch , cibo , lost leaf , etc , i feel so proud of what is happening here , and so excited to be here as it 's beginning . palatte really embodies all of this .
4 i. love . this . place . : -rrb- i spent a good amount of money there , but on a wide variety of items : * <unk> wooden leaf ashtray with <unk> <unk> <unk> * <unk> black cigarette holder -lrb- with <unk> <unk> ! -rrb- * square , metal
3 we finally got around to trying this place . took ages , considering it 's right down the road from us , lol . anyway , it was super empty -lrb- and it always looks super empty -rrb- , considering what an amazing premise they operate by : the wall
0 i loathe this place . partly because its a faux irish pub * , partly because the service sucks and the food is mediocre at best . i go to bars for good drinks and good food . if the staff is hot girls in skimpy outfits , that can
4 they just updated their menu and it 's good ! they have a better variety of entrees now and all the new ones i 've tried are pretty darn good . they also swapped out strong bow for <unk> 's irish cider and the stella for guinness 250 which is
1 they do have some good chicken fingers but other than that they are over-rated and over priced . their lemonade is excellent but they charge for refills . cane sauce was good . overall , i will not be a repeat customer .
3 my wife and i went to the <unk> may comedy show on <unk> and we had a blast . we only paid $ 6 for parking as the first two hours -lrb- $ 2 -rrb- are comped by stand up live . we purchased tickets for the <unk> show but
2 why is there no law preventing the <unk> of people in a <unk> with <unk> in hand from doing so on first friday between 5pm and midnight ? if you are a little claustrophobic ... as i am ... you will not want to be in this little place .
2 yum and yet a bit of a yawn . yes it was a bit of yesterday as i appreciated the decor and the speed of the service . nothing stood out much . the place was clean and made me think of driving a few hours further south for the
3 started with a wedge just to pick something simple . theirs is really good because their blue cheese is savory blue . their root beer is <unk> too . i believe that i may need to re-visit the place soon so that i can really say more about this that
3 by writing this i get that i am admitting to attending this venue at least once . truth be told , i love to drop in this place and hear the old true western and cowboy music done live by performers who are passionate to keep it real and alive
4 props for having the hippest late night sushi reverse happy hour open til 2am . after a show at the us airways center , walk down the road and have some quality sushi with some quality staff , jamming to quality old school pop music . this place has plenty
3 in da jungle , da pita jungle , the hummus rules the nite ! ah <unk> ... in the jungle the pita jungle ... dolmades were also tight ... heh heh ! <unk> ahhhh ooooh <unk> <unk> di di day ... -lrb- repeat -rrb- . so i am singing about
4 screw all grocery stores except trader joe 's . this is la creme de la crop , i am telling you . i have this strange addiction to the place that keeps me coming back time and again . could it be the amazing prices ? yes . could it
3 i hate to be such a follower , but this place is 4 star worthy for sure . smashburger opened recently by my house and being such an in-n-out addict -lrb- see in-n-out review -rrb- i thought i might as well start reviewing other burger joints . this particular joint
3 this is a really neat little joint ! do n't let the suburban strip mall exterior fool you . you park outside and step in , and it 's a large couple of rooms with high ceilings and rustic wood rafters that great you . the waiters march around in
2 i would take republic ramen for what it is - fast food ramen priced inexpensively , located in the heart of a college town . there is , unfortunately , a huge dearth of good ramen places here in phoenix . when my girlfriend told me about this , i
2 this is a 3.5 stars , rounded down to a 3 . it 's solid , down home brunch food that 's done well . we came here over father 's day sunday , so it was very busy . being that it was just my husband and myself ,
4 <unk> . that 's how my butt felt when waking up yesterday morning . and i owe the pain to my previous day hike at pinnacle peak . i consider myself to be in pretty good shape - i weight train , spin , <unk> , or do something active
3 besides the fact that i stopped here for lunch during a quick break from work i felt like a `` lady who lunches '' in this adorable cottage . it 's so adorable that i figured there would be a large lunch crowd , but we were able to easily
3 after pigging out in sf for 10 days i made gabi k promise to only take me to healthy restaurants during my trip to phoenix . as soon as she picked me up from the airport she made good on that promise by taking me to taylor 's for lunch
3 oh rito 's , how you haunt me . i know you 're not good for me . you 're really not working with my intentions of `` getting into shape '' and `` eating better . '' oh well , you are so delicious . rito 's is a
3 we go for happy hour . i 've been for dinner before and enjoyed it - but happy hour is what keeps us coming back . the drink list is intriguing , and i 've enjoyed trying new cocktails . think it is $ 2 off normal prices during hh
3 i 'm a fan , but you have to know what to expect . if you 're a <unk> , one of those types that always talks about how much better chicago is than every place else in the world , and about how no one really knows good pizza
2 this place is the best hot dog joint around . they have a large selection of dogs to choose from and they are all cooked over a wood burning grill . i always leave satisfied . you order and then stand around as the dog cooks , waiting until it
3 i went here towards the end of the lunch hour push and it was still quite busy . the line was n't long , but most of the tables were full which is a good sign . it is in a tricky parking lot , be prepared to pass it
3 i have enjoyed med fresh each time i 've gone . their skewered and grilled chicken seems to be what i order the most . it is always very moist and tasty . i 've also gotten a combo platter that has a little bit of everything and i have
2 we stopping in for a quick meal and split a half chicken . the chicken was very tasty and similar to tandoori chicken . the outside was flavorful and <unk> while the inside was juicy . the skin was extra crispy too . it is definitely some of the best
0 i decided to branch out and try a new korean place . i wanted to see how <unk> my usual place -lrb- cho dang -rrb- was . i was n't surprised to find out that cho dang is in a league of its own when it comes to korean bbq
2 if i was going to review the view , then i would give it 5 stars -lrb- though driving up to the view almost made sick with fear ... -rrb- i met my friends for dinner on friday night ... there were 8 of us , but the service was
3 the parlor is flat out amazing ! this was my second time here and this time i played it smart . i went with 2 friends and we all were having a tough time figuring out what we wanted to eat . everything sounded so good . so we decided
3 i have to thank sarah g for telling me about this place ... the desserts alone are worth going in there . they have this white macadamia nut cookie that is to die for -lrb- and i hate nuts ! -rrb- the breakfast was ok , nothing to write home
3 so happy that i came here today ... i was already <unk> out at tempe marketplace -lrb- i was a little <unk> with my packages -rrb- i was hungry and almost did the horrible thing and have the cheesecake factory desserts at barnes and noble when i noticed tea infusion
4 ok i am poor ... and lifetime is the reason for it . but you know what ... i do n't care ... i heart lifetime fitness . it is the only gym that i actually feel comfortable working out in . they never tried to upsell me on packages
4 i wish this place was n't out of my way for breakfast or lunch , or i would be there more often . i went in there today for a last minute lunch idea ... i just love how friendly the staff is . the owner seemed to know everybody
3 wow , i ca n't believe these negative reviews . i went there last week for the first time and i have to say that i thought that it was wonderful . besides some service <unk> i thoroughly enjoyed my experience . my mom never had mexican food before -lrb-
3 sorry , it 's been a while since i 've been to the mission ; but reading someone else 's review made me realize ; i need to yelp . whenever i see corn on the menu ; i have to get the street corn - yummy !!! just always
3 i 'm kind of in awe of reviewers that think they know what authentic <unk> food is . i 'm no expert , do n't claim to be ; i 'm just a 3rd generation asian-american ; whose family mostly are <unk> of asian-american restaurants . taste is a subjective
3 sliders are the reason i first started to go here ; but i have grown to love the other food . always wanted to try white castle ; so , i 've gone to ones in cleveland , minneapolis - i love chicago hamburgers more !!! the fries are very
3 love this place ... great bbq , i get the greens to go in the <unk> quart container ... want to go back for the fried chicken sometime -lrb- served in the evening -rrb- ... i guess , i must pick all the good things on a menu ; because
3 i have n't eaten here for many years -lrb- decades -rrb- . was looking for a place <unk> to <unk> 's fish & chips -lrb- nw - seattle -rrb- chain . was hoping that i could find the fish similar ; it is the breading is very <unk> to what
3 i used to go to the location on <unk> ; been going to honey bear 's since the early 90 's ... love honey bears ; it 's great they are in central phx -lrb- closer to me now -rrb- ; i see they have greens on the menu -lrb-
4 i love you thai hut !!! : -rrb- i must admit , yesterday was sunday and you were closed so i cheated on you with the thai elephant . i now realize that even though it was delicious and fun , you are the only one who can satisfy my
3 i got ta tell you i love hannys . if you do n't know the story hanny 's used to be a department store about 50 years ago . the city considered the painted sign on the building to be a city land mark so they decided to just keep
4 i love you fez ! if i was n't married i might just move in with you . this place has `` it '' down . they have the wow factor and keep it going . the menu is diverse and has some really different items that are fantastic !
3 due to being a vegetarian , the pure thought of in-n-out used to make me feel a little <unk> and queasy . i mean that 's a lot of meat being pumped out of one chain . i digress . anyhow , i got dragged there and boy oh boy
3 typical amc . i 'm not really a great person to review theaters because i do n't get the appeal . i prefer my netflix and <unk> . cheaper , i can drink , watch on my own time , eat whatever i want and lay on my couch !
4 hooray ! we finally made it here for lunch . it felt as though we were in downtown phoenix again due to the hip and locally owned feel . i wish there could be so many more places like this in the neighborhood . the building is small and charming
4 my favorite phoenix area pizza ... and i have been everywhere . try the unique , <unk> rustica pizzas . wine selection is good and the ambiance is really nice , romantic , yet not over the top .
4 top notch for dessert and coffee in old town . great selection of gelato and cafe choices . the furniture is all modern and the vibe is very upscale . great place .
4 great old town bar . cheap specials every day . the food is well above `` bar food '' genre . the vibe is always vibrant and noisy ... in a good way . eat here for breakfast , lunch or dinner . one of my `` go to ''
4 this is a hidden gem . tucked away in a plaza , this place has very authentic food . the best part is -- they serve chinese and italian food ! the pastas are delicious . they also have a sushi bar ! near midtown phoenix , this place is
4 one of my favorite places to hit happy hour in old town . this along with the adjacent cafe zuzu at the hotel are great places to show friends from out of town . the whole hotel is vintage and trader vics is a polynesian paradise . food is comforting
3 cool treasure , kind of hidden in downtown chandler . obviously a great and local wine selection . but the impressively tasty italian food made the night a good one . service staff is very knowledgeable as well .
3 this place is a secret . it is a little hard to find in ahwatukee . but go find it . ahwatukee is seriously lacking in non-chain , quality restaurants . this one is a good one . great decor inside and the food was a little spicy but not
2 never been a fan of the food here . very mediocre . that being said , this is one of the nicest mexican restaurants in terms of decor and ambience . on a good note ... the salsas are very good and taste fresh .
4 came in here on a random mid-week night with a few friends . when we got there , we were greeted and seated immediately . our server was very bubbly and explained every aspect of the restaurant and menu to us . i was incredibly impressed . we all order
3 for some reason i had n't gone to this location yet , even though i am a big fan of sports , bar food , and drinks . i went this last sunday with my roommate to watch some football . it was packed , but we were still able
3 4 stars for the grilled cheese alone . mmmmm , smoked gouda . never had anything else , nor am i going to venture away from eating anything but the grilled cheese . nothing really appeals to me , anyway . but i come here a lot because the grilled
4 grilled cheese & tomato soup ... and i do n't even like tomatoes ! delicious .
4 5 stars because they brought onion rings back , you can order chicken strips off the kids menu , and i 'm here every single wednesday .
3 my boyfriend and i ate here at couple of weeks ago . i had never eaten korean bbq before so we decided to try it . the food was good , but what i really liked in the restaurant was the fact that we could cook our own food .
0 i like going to red robin ; however , i do not particularly like the one located at the tempe marketplace . my boyfriend and i decided to eat dinner there last sunday night . we were pretty hungry and we thought that red robin would hit the spot .
3 yesterday i was on the hunt to find a restaurant in phoenix that served lobster bisque . unfortunately , i never found it . what i did find was firebirds . the only thing i had yesterday was a fruit smoothie . i was so <unk> down with work that
3 so it 's a chain . i like it . who is making up these <unk> rules that we ca n't dine at , write about , or enjoy a chain restaurant anyway ? i actually come here primarily when my mom is visiting because she likes it . so
2 3.5 stars . my husband and i stopped in for lunch after the farmers market in the same strip mall . i liked the warm feel of the place , and that the menu has some options that only have an asian twist . my f 'n loaded sliders -lrb-
4 my husband and i were given a collection of penzey 's spices as a wedding gift years ago , and it was one of the best gifts we received . little did i know , we would be moving to scottsdale a few years later and would find a store
2 great menu with lots of choices and classic rock music -lrb- that means the 70 's , not the 90 's little yelpers -rrb- . i have found the food to always be good , although they sometimes run out of things -lrb- ahi or crab cakes in particular -rrb-
2 well i promised my husband we would eat out less . we , meaning him and i. by myself , there is no we , just i , and i made no such promise . i had to go to staples , -lrb- never go to staples hungry -rrb- ,
2 3.5 stars for me . my first thought upon walking in was `` wow , it 's small . '' not a bad thing necessarily . could be a good thing in fact . i ordered a `` <unk> lady '' cocktail -lrb- gin , <unk> , lemon juice ,
3 more like whole paycheck market . looking for a way to <unk> the mental <unk> i feel when i think about where my burger comes from , but not ready to abandon my <unk> and actually become a vegetarian , i 've been looking for sources of meat , poultry
3 these little <unk> come from a small farm in nebraska still run by the family of one of the <unk> of pork on a fork . of course , the prices are higher than that you would pay in the mega grocery stores today . but for me , not
3 $ 9.95 for the dinner buffet that includes tandoori chicken and perfect garlicky naan brought straight to your table . i 'm pretty sure i had about $ 7 in naan myself . how can you beat that ? well it takes more than price for me to be happy
4 <unk> 's is exactly what scottsdale so sorely needs . a nice , friendly neighborhood joint to grab a drink for less than $ 10.00 -lrb- way less -rrb- that is unpretentious , warm , and inviting . you do n't even need fake <unk> or cougar attire to get
3 why is it they can make frozen yogurt taste like ice cream , but ca n't make regular yogurt taste more like a milkshake ? sure , the regular yogurt people <unk> all these flavors like key lime pie and apple turnover , but i 'm not fooled . i
3 i took my mom and my aunts to afternoon tea service recently . served in the lobby tea court , we were seated near the hotel entrance . i wished i had thought to request a nice window seat when making the reservation , but it was still a lovely
3 after hearing orange table had gotten their service issues corrected , i had to judge for myself . it 's true !!!!!!!! things were a little slow in the beginning , so i was worried . but once our server did make it to us , things were pretty good
4 the first time i went to mesa arts center was one of the first times i had been to mesa in many years , and i was skeptical . as we drove down `` country club '' passing beer world , the <unk> man , and a check <unk> business
3 you would think this place is actually in mexico given how long i had been meaning to try it . i can only say , i should have gone sooner . really good mexican <unk> the touristy crap or the <unk> up version . i tried the green chile and
2 my husband and i were at the tempe arts festival around lunch time , and i spotted la bocca . i had it mentally bookmarked for quite a long time , so i was excited to finally try it . i was somewhat disappointed . while i appreciate the pretty
4 if eddie 's house ever rents a room , i 'm moving in ! 4.5 stars , but i think i 'm too stingy with that 5th star sometimes . fear of commitment maybe ? i had dinner here with dottsy z before the infamous night at <unk> 's ,
3 had lunch here saturday afternoon . if you have ever been to first watch when it was here , you would not recognize the interior . the building has been completely remodeled to give a cozy lodge feel . i 'm talking scottsdale cozy lodge keep in mind . there
3 sat on the patio last <unk> lamp on of course . really lovely , and the waterfalls drown out the sound of traffic on hayden . i wanted sangria but did n't see it on the menu . not only did they have it , it is probably some of
2 i had a girlfriend visiting this weekend , and we had lunch here yesterday . i hesitated based on my first visit , but i did want to give cafe carumba a second chance . it was really slow to get our drink order taken , but the restaurant was
3 dear mr. betos : after finding an <unk> object in my guac that tasted <unk> like a piece of <unk> chicken judging from the <unk> it was in my mouth , you 've given me a reason to look to your neighbor to the south for my grease fix .
2 yep , i like it . another place i really only come to when my mom visits as she likes it . i ordered the tortilla soup tonight and it was really good . i 'm also a fan of the cornbread they serve in lieu of same ole '
2 old town scottsdale has a personality disorder . it tries to be one thing during the day and another at night . merchants are <unk> for hellish fees in order to provide the `` free '' parking so prices reflect this big <unk> as some have to make up six
4 i have to add another star . we were just there again last night and the food and service were once again the very best . there is nothing pretentious about this place . it 's like sitting down in a relative 's kitchen to have dinner . it 's
4 such yummy food . tractor pizza and avocado , beet , grapefruit salad were so good . hot wings were amazing , deep fried first . and the pop tarts , omg , yum !
3 the back patio is lovely in the <unk> ... my favorite is the mole !
3 i 've been coming here for the last 3 years and have to say it always delivers . the drink specials are addicting , the food is way beyond what you 'd expect at a bar , and the scene on weekends is packed full of people looking to kick
4 oscar mike golf ! with a side of whiskey , tango , <unk> . how is this so good . how am i <unk> the willpower to type as i am floating in a wonderful world where there is no such thing as war , disease , <unk> <unk> .
3 really great martinis and my favorite chicken sandwich around . only problem is the place gets old after you 've been there a few times . but it 's always fun for late night .
3 i really love this place ! i come here quite often with my family being that it 's done the street from our house . the service is quick and friendly and we 've grown seriously attached to our favorite waiter . i always order off of the specials menu
4 had breakfast on saturday ... homemade hash and eggs ! the coffee was great and the staff was prompt and friendly ! i recommend this place for a good meal !!!
3 i met up with a good buddy of mine for a little <unk> , a little ambience , and some yummy food . we were excited to try this place for the first time so here 's how it turned out : great parking was a pleasant surprise when we
3 so christmas `` dinner '' was kind of an afterthought this year ... travelling and a time warp sort of forced that on our little merry band and we were famished by 9pm . we went to a couple of other places first , one had an excessive wait and
3 i have a couple of quirky friends i meet up with once a month or so , and we just have so much fun . i wanted a diner waffle and sausage this time , along with coffee , and it really hit the spot . the wait staff is
3 so ... i had a hankering for the <unk> ricotta pancakes and met up with some of my pals to satisfy the craving this past sunday . we were greeted warmly by sergio who kept us well stocked with coffee and water . my pals had burrata and <unk> ;
3 yum ! still great and jamming folks in : -rrb- had hh there on friday -lrb- because i needed the <unk> <unk> combo -rrb- and really loved it . had the sweet potato and added some schreiner ' sausage but need to get the combo right next time i go
2 sprouts is a decent place to find the typical <unk> store selection of `` corporate '' organic foods like amy 's , but it does n't have the atmosphere or selection of a whole foods or the fun choices that you will find at trader joe 's . they have
3 awesome fresh ingredients , great <unk> scones , and an awesome location at the back of the farm at south mountain . morning glory cafe has amazing omelettes -- the greek and farm are my favorites . they also have delicious french toast . if you have friends come in
3 best spinach/artichoke dip ever ! and when i have company in town this place is a great choice . my family & friends are always super impressed with the food and the beer . the college crowd and the limited parking is a bit annoying , but again , that
3 do n't be fooled by the name , or that everything on the menu is vegan , this is not the place for anyone on a diet or `` watching what they eat '' . the food is delicious comfort food with lots of fried things , in large portions
1 how people can love this restaurant is beyond me . i 've been to multiple locations and they were all disappointing . the only reason it gets two stars instead of one is because i thought their breakfast was ok . every time i go here i am unimpressed .
4 picked up my new imac today . everyone is just super friendly and upbeat . i love good customer service . i did have to wait a bit , but everyone is just so nice i really did n't mind ! plus , i got to chat while i waited
2 drive past this place every day to and from my trek to work . i first noticed it a few months ago when they put up the signage . the cool , sans <unk> font and <unk> sign caught my attention . as a designer , i 'm always intrigued
1 holy hipster batman ! how this place has 4 stars is beyond me . the service is absolutely terrible . and if there 's one thing you should focus on above all , it 's the service . it gets 2 stars simply for being unique and interesting . it
4 found out the dj there on saturdays spins trip hop ! <unk> , pretty lights , <unk> , kill paris , <unk> & <unk> and so much more . if you do n't know what i 'm talking about , go check it out . you will kick yourself for
4 oh cherryblossom , where have you been my whole life <unk> discovered this spot by looking for restaurants nearby my workplace . checked it out online , seemed decent enough . loved the feeling upon walking , very `` homely '' an authentic . i was confused by the <unk>
3 i really dig this place . but honestly , i just love the atmosphere . it 's a perfect spot to go to on a nice day in phoenix . it 's admittedly very crowded during lunch and brunch -lrb- on weekends -rrb- , but so far i 've never
2 mixed ... success depends on your agenda for that day . busy , popping , happening and great band - scores high . other scores average . went there last night -lrb- sat -rrb- with two girlfriends -lrb- 6:30 pm -rrb- . sound system was so loud we could n't
3 it 's all about the views . the views from every floor . the views in every direction . i lay in my bed on the 7th floor and kept waking to check the changing views as the night progressed into morning . the most spectacular views were from the
4 finally ! an amazing place to get fantastic bbq sandwiches in phoenix ! i went here for the first time a few weeks back -lrb- totally <unk> out on the yelp reviewing -rrb- . some co-workers suggested we go there , saying it was one of the best places in
4 i went here for the first time today during the lunch hour , and holy moly was it good ! a friend recommended it , so we all went -lrb- as a rather large group -rrb- to try it out . it 's not a very fancy place , but
0 they should have stayed in chicago . the worst service and one of the <unk> restaurant experiences i have had in years . we never could figure out who our waiter was ! they would take orders and disappear for eons . my wife 's pizza was delivered first and
1 the food is way over rated . good but <unk> service . we had to wave down the staff all dinner for chips and salsa , water , extra drinks and our check . the food was maybe one star plus . go to los sombreros for the real deal
4 yum . i love coming here for dinner . the food is always superb . i think it 's amazing that we have such a great seafood place in the middle of the desert . first off , the service here is first class . they know what they are
3 i must confess i have only been here for lunch , but it is one of the best deals in town for lunch . my friend and i just ate there and had chicken teriyaki , white rice , salad , 2 sushi rolls and a squid salad and only
3 i went here yesterday for lunch with a friend of mine and sat outside on their second story . the service was prompt and polite and the food was delicious ! i had the chicken sandwich and my friend had the rnr burger -lrb- we split everything down the middle
4 my favorite burger . period . this might be in my list of last meal foods . food is always fast , fresh and delicious . it 's awesome to still be able to find an old school style burger restaurant with a simple menu . you want chicken ?
3 this place is a great <unk> coast style italian grocery store that offers a wide variety of pastas and sandwiches . i 've been coming here since my asu days and found defalco 's to be a good deal for the money and taste for sandwiches . i almost always
3 finally made my way to this place after i first heard about it and it is pretty amazing . some of the items on the menu were very traditional to the izakaya concept , which is cool . the sushi was pretty standard and very fresh , but no different
2 i love record stores . let me repeat that : i love record stores . at 14 , i was singing the praises of vinyl to anyone who would listen , and so few of my peers understood that music simply sounds better on vinyl . at 25 , i
3 so a friend suggested we go to this awesome sandwich place for dinner - the only disclaimer he made was that it 's cash only . this was n't a problem for me , because places that only take cash are usually less expensive - those credit machines are n't
4 the best guinness in town . their mussels are delightful , as is the rest of their food . but really , i go here for the perfectly poured guinness .
3 let me start off by saying i am only giving it 4 stars because i love their happy hour and reverse happy hour . i have only gone once during <unk> hour times and felt ripped off . okay now that all the negativity is done , the happy hour
3 pretty good . looked it up on google local . only one size . recommend at least once . also , the shrimp , rice paper roll is really good -lrb- <unk> -rrb- . you should try it .
3 where to start , where to start . i do n't know if it deserves four stars or not . i am definitely stuck in the middle . what i liked : atmosphere , free piping hot corn bread served out of a skillet , and its been so long
3 the oatmeal cookie <unk> here totally lives up to the hype . it 's amazing . also , i tried a sample of graham cracker crust the other day and that was really good too . they have fancier toppings than most of the other froyo places and they are
3 i love this place ! i 've tried several different things here but my favorites are the gobi <unk> and the palak paneer . it 's all vegetarian which was awesome when i was a vegetarian but it 's just as good now even when i 'm not one .
4 this was my favorite restaurant in college . we came here all the time . the staff was always friendly , good service , and the sushi is so good and cheap . the tofu steak is great to start with , and if you 're going to skip sushi
4 bass pro shop is the bees knees . literally walking into this place makes me wish i knew how to do every outdoor activity known to man . the store is just awesome . everything you could every imagine is in here ... and more . we got all of
4 this place is awesome . even if you do n't need anything , just go here and check it out . it 's huge and filled with every kind of mexican food you can possibly imagine . everything is really cheap and they have tons of fresh produce . they
4 i love everything about this place . it 's healthy , it 's delicious , tons of organic options . you just feel good going here . the spaghetti squash casserole is really good , so is the panang curry with tofu ... but my favorite thing is the kale
4 definitely the best thai place in old town . always good service , never a wait , was quick for take out too . my favorite thing is the chicken panang and my boyfriend likes the yellow curry . we tried the siamese <unk> last time too and those were
3 i love you . i am not just saying that because of the amazing selection of craft beers constantly available to me . nor because of the seasonal and special selection craft beers that are ever rotating or the amazing prices . part of it might be the growler bar
4 i am never in scottsdale , ever . but this one time , i was on my way to my friends ' house in scottsdale when i was <unk> for my espresso and remembered that one of the coolest dudes i know -lrb- don s. -rrb- raved about this place
3 if you are looking for good authentic mexican food , this is the spot . my family has been coming here for years . it 's one of those places my long time separated parents can even agree on ! for starters , the chips and salsa are really very
4 my favorite things about symphony hall is how much culture to which it is actually a performance home . the ballet , the opera , the symphony , and more . you need not look further than symphony hall if you are in search of something to bring some depth
4 this place has the most comfortable comfort food i have ever tried ... my night ended in a food coma . so there . we walked in and were seated right away . i love the feel of this place . warm , welcome , quirky , and just the
3 you walk in and grab a menu , seat yourself and when you are ready to order you hop up to the register to made your selections . this place is cute , trendy , understated with <unk> bitty <unk> with a flower or two , lots of art on
1 not terrible but very expensive and a bit of an odd presentation . i stopped in for lunch the other day and sat at the bar . i found the menu a bit confusing but finally settled on the <unk> with collard greens . it arrived quickly . the plate
2 there really should be a two and a half star rating . i mean , come on , the territory between `` meh , i 've had better '' and `` a-ok '' is pretty vast . in any case , we popped in for happy hour to check it
1 really wanted to love it . and really did n't ! i was excited to see what was described as an `` izakaya '' style lounge - perhaps my favorite way to enjoy japanese food - but let me tell you , this ai n't no izakaya . an izakaya
3 i have to say i love this place . the fact that it 's around the corner from my house does n't hurt but i 'm a bit baffled by the haters here . expensive ? are you kidding ? it 's unpretentious , friendly and they have a great
1 i 'm afraid this is one of those `` i wanted to love it , but ... '' reviews . we had an assortment of tacos and burritos . they were fine but absolutely nothing special whatsoever . yes , they were authentic mexican tacos -lrb- i.e. , not taco
3 we 've been back to chompie 's several times and we really like it . everything we 've ever had to eat here is quite good and the service is always excellent . it 's definitely the best jewish deli we 've found in the valley .
2 great for happy hour - if you keep it simple - but not particularly good otherwise . this restaurant is in a very convenient location and there 's almost always parking right in front . you can sit outside on the patio and when the weather 's nice , it
1 if you like hot cucumbers , you 'd better get into ohso fast , because i 'd bet this place has a six month to one year <unk> . really , hot cucumbers ? my partner and i were excited to see ohso from the street , and i was
1 cool old hotel , interesting ghost stories . but everything else is just so-so . stopped in at happy hour and <unk> for a couple of drinks . the place was seriously dead as a <unk> at 5:45 pm on a friday afternoon . that says something about the community
4 i love filmbar . what could be better than watching an indie film with a good , cold beer in a place where only people with similar interests hang out ? the front section of the place , when you walk in , is a small bar with a good
1 i typically love bars like this that are n't full of people just trying to impress one another . the kind of bars you do n't dress up for , and just go to hang out with your friends and watch a game or play pool . i came here
2 i like coming here after work because they have a good happy hour menu . i like the edamame , philadelphia roll , shrimp tempura roll , and viva las vegas roll . i 've tried most of the other rolls and thought they were kind of blah . the
1 i went here for happy hour at 5:30 pm on a thursday and it was n't too crowded . we sat outside which was a mistake because it was so loud with all the bikes across the street . the drinks were just ok , and the brie appetizer was
4 great local bar with nice people and excellent service . i like to go there for monday night football because they put it up on a hd projector screen against a huge white wall outside , it looks great . bartenders are nice and quick to serve . it 's
3 awesome lunch spot ! every time i go here i leave satisfied ... i used to go here all the time when i worked at <unk> but now have moved up to dc ranch area . not going to lie , i have driven all the way down to old
3 this place is really cool and a lot of fun . inside is nice and clean . hip music playing in the background while you relax and dine . the best part is watching all sorts of tasty items cruising across the conveyor belt right in front of you that
3 came here to celebrate our daughter 's 30th b-day and brought both family , friends and the grand kid . she ask to go here and then next door afterwards for some snoh . sounds good to me . inside is simple and cozy with a casual rustic japanese theme
4 growing up in east texas good bbq is hard to find in az . . i 've been here several times and it is always great . the brisket just melts in your mouth . one of my az favorites is the full rack of pork spare ribs with his
4 i love rudy 's and good tx bbq and was missing it so dearly until now . used to go here all the time when visiting friends and family in and around the austin area . just learned about this az location from one of my vendors at work and
3 finally had the chance to stop in here for lunch and was not disappointed . arrived right when they opened and was the first one to get served . sweet ! this location is definitely set up with the college kids in mind . inside is very dark with black
3 came here to enjoy some tasty german and dutch beer on tap with yelp ` er scott d and found the visit to be both fantabulous as well as <unk> . nothing like a cold one and some good company to feed the soul . nice ! what a selection
3 oh wow . what an experience ! my boyfriend and i went to razz 's for his birthday on the recommendation of a friend . thank you <unk> ! the food was amazing and eating up at the bar with razz himself was the best . we were originally sitting
2 i was supposed to be meeting several people there for a happy hour , but got stood up . it turned out to be ok though . my server patrick was very nice and helped me decide on a delicious sauvignon blanc and some nice cheeses . i also had
4 wowza ! this place is amazing ! thanks to paul v. i was able to try rocket burger many times and every time has been fantastic . i had the bacon double cheeseburger with fries or cheese curds and it 's so delicious . the burger is greasy , cheesy
4 i came here after receiving a free pizza at a yelp event . upper crust had some of the best food at the event so i could n't wait to have dinner at the restaurant . my friend and i came here on a wednesday and were pleasantly surprised it
3 i came here with a friend before heading to the movies . i bought the yelp deal which was a gift certificate $ 10 for $ 20 towards your purchase . the servers were very friendly and knowledgeable . we had the endless chips and salsa and 2 shredded beef
3 pho was amazing !!!! this was my first pho experience , but i loved it ! i am coming back ! had the number # 13 , lean pork . they gave me a lot , i could not finish it .
3 good breakfasts options . they have your classics and some tasty healthy alternatives too .
4 got a craving for fish and chips ? best place in town i think . great fish and shrimp .
1 now i 've been to tia rosa several times and i 've always enjoyed the food and margaritas . i specifically love the grilled peppers and onions you receive with some dishes . that said , last time i was there , i ordered a vegetarian burro -lrb- $ 12
3 what can i say that has n't been said already . this place is great ! great decor , great food , great service ! living in gilbert , we do n't get over this way all that often , but i 'd definitely like to go back !
2 this place was pretty good . cute patio . margaritas are strong , but limited menu . i had the portabella tacos . did n't care for the blue cheese on them so next time i 'll try it without . i 'd definitely like to give them another try
4 the bf and i just love this place ! fabulous margaritas ... and cheap during happy hour ! great chips and salsa , and tableside guacamole . the enchiladas de avocado is our favorite entree . it comes with this amazing jicama salad which i think i love even more
3 descent . good place to sit on the patio .
2 i love eating here and the drinks are great . the bar staff is wonderful but for some reason the female wait staff continues to be off-putting . they seem unhappy to take our tables and when the bill comes they give us an <unk> receipt that leaves off the
3 fun place ! love all the old fashioned drinks and pie !
4 really good , healthy food . owner is super friendly . would definitely recommend . : -rrb-
3 yummy food , good place for guys who like sports . great staff .
4 rum bar is fantastic ! food is good too . service has always been excellent .
3 good place friendly staff .
4 produce cheap , layout awesome .
4 best calamari in town , and awesome service . tokyo glow is a great drink , super refreshing .
4 so yummy and totally worth the wait . if you do n't want to wait , order to go and eat in the park . always ask what the special is , great for sharing .
1 a <unk> , trendy place , whose -lrb- to me -rrb- only two redeeming qualities are its eateries , and its proximity to my house . whoever designed this small outdoor mall never took a course in traffic flow patterns or how many parking spaces a mall of this size
3 do n't know about the happy hour , went here for dinner . very good seafood . the escargot was one of the two best i 've had in phoenix . the mahi mahi crusted with coconut was done to perfection . the shrimp in a spicy pomodoro sauce was
2 like salt , which is right next door , this is a very nice bar , in a very good location . we had very good service all 3 times we 've been there . have n't eaten there , so ca n't comment on the food . excellent <unk>
1 this would be good mexican food if we were in quebec someplace ... maybe i should n't say that , maybe they have quite good mexican food in canada ... but we have excellent mexican food here in the valley of the sun . many five star locations . more
1 the food was adequate , as were the drinks . it 's location in the middle of a clothing store does not <unk> it to me either . and to top it off , very pricey for what it was ...
3 nice little corner place to grab a cup of coffee and have a morning meeting ... can sit inside or out . i 'm not big on the specialty coffees , so i only go to the outside spot , but the coffee was pretty good .
3 okay , i have to admit ... i did not want to go here . the mere thought of eating dinner while watching a film among other diners ... i have enough trouble getting idiots to shut up when i 'm at a normal theater ... but was i pleasantly
0 i wanted to like this place . the decor was cute when we walked in , the restaurant is a converted house , and the owner of the restaurant was the only one working besides a hispanic girl in the kitchen . unfortunately , the food and service were very
4 i love this place ! i have ordered a few different types of crepes and they have all been delicious . my favorite is the brie crepe . i even love the side salad !
3 great food and good service . the steak was cooked perfectly and i definitely recommend the mac and cheese as a side . my only complaint for the night was that the valet gave my car to someone else ! another guest got in the car and started driving off
2 not sure what all of the hype is about ... i would much rather drive to del <unk> in <unk> scottsdale . the sauce was rather sweet and the sides were overpriced -lrb- over $ 5 for a small side -rrb- . overall , it 's alright .
1 i was unimpressed with ruth 's chris . the decor was dated . the servers reached across the table to serve and remove plates instead of properly from the <unk> . we were even asked to hand them our dirty dishes . the plates they could reach were removed before
4 what is it about <unk> that i love so much ? see , it is n't just one thing ... it 's everything . my husband and i eat here about once a month . sometimes an early dinner and sometimes the lunch buffet . and everytime we go we
3 this was the first stop on our restaurant week agenda ! my husband has driven by this on numerous occasions recently and this was his pick . good pick ! we made a reservation for 7 on a sunday night . we were greeted and seated almost immediately -lrb- bonus
3 love bevmo 's 5 cent wine sale ! and now it is all the time and you can even mix and match . what a great way to try new wines ! i only wish this store was larger . the one at tempe marketplace is bigger and had a
4 we have been back two more times ... both times for sunday brunch ! wow ! great choices ... the menu changes but i have had their eggs benedict and a fabulous omelet . and $ 5 mimosas ... what is not to like ?
4 there 's something magical about the coconut lime mojito . i fell in love with the cuban concoction the first time i tried one many years ago and i have just fallen in love all over again . this review is based mainly on the drinks , as i tried
3 bevmo is like <unk> for adults . the first time i walked in my jaw dropped and i was in awe . great , great , great prices . we bought all of our alcohol for our wedding here - liquor , wine , champagne , kegs . they gave
1 the way this dish was made reminds me of backyard cooking and where you have 5 cooks help preparing one dish and each does their assigned part a little differently . i have n't been here in a few years ... after i heard it got renovated and new management
3 i 've been here a couple more times . the food is good with many tasteful selection , and the service always brings your meal to you and keep the place organized . they have <unk> rooms for customers and that serves a special purpose of having business <unk> .
3 the magic mushroom burger is my favorite at this place , for $ 4.50 . it uses angus beef which gives it a natural taste , and comes with lettuce , tomato and thousand island type dressing . the burger was not dripping wet and it was not hard to
2 food is sacred in certain cultures , just ask the french . in america , it is done differently . it 's blasphemous to eat certain se asian food alone , such as thai & lao food . it is best when shared and eaten in a communal setting ,
3 i entered the cpk world late in life , and i 'm sad about it because , apparently , i 've been missing out . cpk is great ! contrary to what i thought , it 's not just a place for pizza . although the place can suit all
4 after reading all the great reviews about this place , i just had to go , so i gathered three of my friends and drove the 20 or so minutes from tempe to get there , <unk> any pressure to get homework or reading <unk> done -lrb- or , for
2 i went to gelato 64 because i was looking for a place to go for dessert after a charity event in gilbert , and this place was the only gelato shop nearby that was open until 11pm on a friday . the people working here were cool and let my
3 the prices were extremely reasonable . the service was a little slow but very good . the night i was there live jazz music which was very good . the only negative thing is to get rid of the chips they use on the cheese dish and replace them with
1 this place i regret coming to sometime there is no consistency with breakfast items . the appearance looks pretty but never hot . i hate going up twice for the price you pay for food they need to get it right the first time . the lunches are good and
3 this place is really yummy ! it is right across the street from work so i go here once or twice a week . they have really good breakfast burritos for around 3 bucks . they 're pretty filling , so it is a great value . they also have
4 i wrote a review on another location , so i wo n't start all over , but i do have to comment on this particular location . the burger is amazing . every time i eat here , it is literally the best burger i 've ever had . the
3 this is the 2nd time we come here and we are already huge fans ! the first time , the service was impressive - the bartender <unk> to us at our table an was not only really friendly and genuine , but knowledgeable and very helpful in wine and food
2 sorry fellow yelpers . . i really wanted to love this place ... so much that i am hoping to go back and trying it again so i can see if it was just an off thing . my experience was on a friday . . near <unk> . .
4 we took my brother out for father 's day here to cibo this sat night . our party of six had called to be put on the list and when we arrived , our table was ready for us ... and it was crowded and busy , so i 'm
3 so i pass by this corner * all * the time and i never knew this place even existed . i had to find out from yelp ... that 's not good marketing . hubby was in the mood for joe 's bbq last night and so to break out
3 so honey and i wanted a lunch out one fine sunday afternoon . . so , with our baby in tow , we hit this joint up . not busy , so we got seated promptly . . outdoor in their patio area with the great weather . our server
3 i 'm still not sure if it 's a 3 or a 4 . . so let me give you the experience . this place is very small - they have an outside patio that seats about 11 total . . and 5 more on couches with these almost hideous
3 i like this for a lunch spot - they 've got tasty options ... and , guess what ? they have lamb wednesdays ! i looove lamb !! their <unk> is awesome ; their lamb chops are great -lrb- just order them cooked med rare , trust me -rrb- and
4 what an outstanding opening party today ... on st. patty 's day , none the less ! they opened for a select group of visitors from <unk> today and it included wine/beer and bruschetta for a cost of $ 25 . what a way to start off in the neighborhood
2 before i go any further , this is a 3.5 rating , not a full 4 ... i did enjoy hanging out here , but a few things could be improved . arrived on an early sunday afternoon and it was quite busy ... long line to order food .
4 love coming here ... even when i do n't plan on buying a book i 'm always ready to walk out with a few - their prices are competitive and they have such a great selection for being a <unk> bookstore that is not a chain . the best part
3 this place sits right next to liberty market and i 've always seen it with a long line for breakfast - i understand why , now . there are literally less than 20 tables in there and its small and crowded . . makes sense . it took our party
1 i was disappointed . i have not been to a sweet tomatoes restaurant for about 3-4 years due to their higher prices , but i went to join a friend for lunch on friday . their pricing is still high -- about $ 12 for lunch and a standard drink
2 my wife loves good tempura so we went to try this place . as most other reviewers have said , this place is just so-so . the prices are higher than most other japanese restaurants by about 15-20 % due to its location and ambiance . the tempura was mediocre
3 ok ; i agree that diamond 's customer wait time is long . but that is because there is only one cook -lrb- the owner -rrb- . and i agree that it could be cleaner , from the walls to the floors to the bathrooms . but come on ,
1 went there for lunch today with my wife since we saw a good review in the paper . we were kind of disappointed . i had the menudo -- while a big bowl , it was not very flavorful . and we also ordered three of the standard -lrb- small
1 not sure what was up with their bar service ; maybe only one person was 21 or over but our party on a friday late afternoon/evening had a nearly impossible time getting drink orders as well as getting them correct ! we were a large party but they knew we
4 checked it out on a whim and was very pleasantly surprised . drinks are healthy pours and appetizers are <unk> enjoyable and enough for two . <unk> staff is happy to have us there . will have to return for dinner .
3 this place is awesome ! where else can you hear incredible live jazz music for free on a monday night with reasonably priced drinks ? any other major city -lrb- like , say , new york -rrb- , the cover would be at least $ 15 , and they would
1 this is the kind of italian restaurant i would go to if it was in my neighborhood , and i could walk to it on occasions when i did n't want to put much thought on where to eat . in essence , i do n't think i 'm going
2 this place is okay . the crepes are pretty good . i 've had the turkey and avocado one and a veggie one . the spinach salad with dried cranberries and almonds has a <unk> dressing that is way too sweet . i guess i should i ask for it
3 honey bears is where i go for my quick meat fix and i 'll tell you why . it is conveniently located near my house , and i have no doubt that this is true of everyone who is reading this review on yelp , and they have lots of
4 one if my buddies hikes camelback twice a week . it turns out this is quite common , and how come i 've never done the hike before . or so i was accosted on the way to the mountain . you find all manner of hiker on the mountain
4 the best burger in phoenix . reminds me of how five guys burgers and fries used to be . the smashburger and smashchicken -lrb- fried -rrb- are delicious . ever since ordering the haystack straws , i 've never been able to muster up the motivation try the fries .
4 the building shaped like a cake that was designed by frank lloyd wright . parking close by in the front lot or a covered lot nearby . broadway quality shows every year . never had a bad seat . always a great experience for the entire family . what is
4 i spent a week in spain , which makes me an expert on spanish cuisine . i spent most of my time in seville , which in no way limits my knowledge of the cuisine as seville has great food . tapas papa frita oozes good food in sauces ,
4 a really great restaurant , this deserves to be said first , and the best vegan/vegetarian in tempe . going on my best of tempe list . if you are one of my <unk> followers on yelp , you know i love meat . when we make plans to eat
1 first of all the restaurant itself is cold , not comfortable . menu is interesting - but fairly limited for a breakfast joint , and when you get down to it the food is fairly bland . also pricey - 2 eggs , bacon , hashbrowns $ 8 . no
3 u got ta like this place . soups - matzo ball , kreplach , cabbage , <unk> - all top notch . love the chopped liver , <unk> <unk> . sandwiches all well done .
3 i really need to get to carlsbad more often . their mexican dishes are top notch and they are not afraid of spice . pecan grilled items steaks , ribs , fish are also always good . great patio , dining room is cool too .
4 yum , yum , yum . there are a hundred reasons you should love oreganos . the food is delicious . they offer huge portions . their salads are amazing and their pasta dishes are even better . the thin crust pizza is great to share . the staff is
3 cute little brewing company with yummy food and good beers . not your typical brewery , but that 's why i like it . service was good , and the place was chill . they had awesome sweet potato fries , and good choices of cider and beers .
3 this is another welcome addition to bell town center , which has been adding some great new businesses in the past few months . i had the little bacon burger which was perfect . super crispy bacon . my husband had the <unk> patties . he enjoyed it . i
3 my first hike ! this was really a fun trail . it was hard for me , but its my first hike ever so i have no others to compare it to . the trail was paved the entire way , so i had ample opportunities to stop and catch
3 i had brunch here on a sunday morning ; it was fairly crowded and loud , which was fine by me . we opted to sit indoors since there was a 20 minute wait for the patio seating . plenty of high chairs available , and we were asked to
3 i really wish this location was closer to my house ! not only is whole foods chock full of yummy , organic and healthy groceries , but they also have hot food stations throughout the store . how cool is that ? lots of <unk> beef and organic <unk> options
2 decided it was time for a <unk> burger , had their bacon burger which was very good . not a real fan of the ambience and might stop by here on occasion .
2 my first time to patronage this establishment . service with amanda was excellent , food just ok -lrb- hot pastrami -rrb- . will give it another try , looking for that one dish i can always count on when the taste hits me ! for all my military buddies ,
3 nice large store with a variety of purchase options from music instruments to of course books . check it out !
2 wish they had <unk> fi here .
3 awesome unique food creations . italian inspired smaller plates . polenta , short ribs , mushrooms etc. . good wine program . friendly owners and staff . nice location off the street . worth finding . comfortable open dining room and <unk> .
3 good sports bar atmosphere . cozy and attentive service . reasonably priced and good bar food . outdoor patios and plenty of tv 's . good neighborhood place to catch a game and some grub .
3 has the <unk> pizza last week . just named best pizza in country by food network magazine . very good pizza , slightly sweet on the palate from sauce or something . had a mozzarella salad which was good and chocolate cake for birthday dessert at no charge . big
3 small and inviting . good iced toddy . parking can be scarce . more spots out back .
0 i heard good things about this place , and was looking forward to what the `` basement '' atmosphere would feel like , <unk> , a little seedy , etc. . sadly , too many middle-aged men wearing flip flops out on a friday night . flip flops ? ugh
4 finally got to eat brunch at the morning glory cafe and it was fantastic ! the only downside was the cost of bloody mary 's ... $ 9 ??? that 's steep . for this time of year , the setting and the weather definitely enhance the dining experience .
4 the best place to find any gift for any person . baby ? <unk> <unk> . grandma ? candle or temp tattoos . boyfriend ? book or shirt . unexpected gifts , this shop is full of surprises . i really enjoy the small , <unk> collection of books they
4 i have always loved this hotel and after recently discovering their happy hour specials , i love it even more ! three dollar drinks ? yes please ! i highly recommend the pomegranate fizz - so delicious that i completely lost track of how many i had ! the pool
4 i 've only eaten here once but i was blown away . the food was absolutely delicious ... probably one of the best meals that i 've ever had in phoenix . the service was phenomenal . if i remember correctly , it is valet parking only . this is
2 i like the setting with the pond and ducks and all but the food was n't spectacular . nothing really stood out . i ordered a pitcher of margaritas that cost 25 $ and was half filled with ice which was a turn off . service was good and the
2 decided to give this place a shot after seeing it on my happy hour app . i signed up for the email newsletter on their website and received a 5 $ coupon when you spend $ 20 or more on anything . food wise , they had half off happy
3 awesome sliders . pretty good service . nice patio . somewhat douchey clientle at times .
3 my favorite thing about 5th and wine is the location itself . i love the decor , i love the comfortable feeling , and just the overall ambiance . i could totally see myself going down there every day and hanging out on one of the couches eating a <unk>
3 i had the privilege of getting to try out ling & louie 's on shea for work -lrb- yes my job is rough -rrb- , and i really enjoyed it ! the atmosphere is casual and fun and the staff is so nice . they were very accommodating and attentive
4 love the dim sum on sunday afternoons . always end up bringing home a lot of leftovers as the little carts full of delicious food keep strolling by . dim sum is a great way to try a variety of foods and this is a great place for it .
3 great happy hour specials ! they also do a special during the summer when the temp hits a certain point they give free chocolate or cheese fondue to they 're facebook fans .
3 the house dressing is an absolute must especially on the old world classic salad . bottles are available for purchase & i believe a dollar off is given for bringing the bottle back for refills . servers are young and hip , my daughter used to say she wanted her
1 being a big fan of breweries i was not impressed with this place . they only had 3 of there beers on tap which i really did n't care for besides the double ipa . the food smelled and looked awesome which i will have to go back and try
3 first off i will say i am a new mexican and have lived in nm most of my life so i came into this place thinking i was going to be disappointed . well ... i was wrong . blue adobe knows how to make some killer new mexican dishes
1 so my friend told me this was the best sports bar in scottsdale and i had to check it out so i figured i would go on sunday to check out the games when i first arrive they have all the games playing on different tvs and they seat you
3 i took advantage of the <unk> special and ordered the 2 meat platter with ribs & brisket . they were both tender and delicious . the brisket has a rich smoky flavor and the ribs had the perfect crust on the outside and juicy meat on the inside . this
4 i love this sports bar ! their menu has something for everyone and everything i have tried was better than average . as you know i 'm a salad girl and a good fresh salad is a must , check ... they have this . their personal size pizza is
4 i can see this little gem becoming a regular habit . the service and food were both wonderful and i loved the comfy feel they have inside . i tried to finish their specialty a havarti & roasted asparagus panini with ham and could n't do it . it 's
4 pom has continued to thrive and grow for good reason . great service , continued quality food and a fun atmosphere with daily specials that tempt even this <unk> creature of habit ! dragon bowl & green protein bowl are still my favorites . the bean burrito for breakfast is
4 for me this place is out in the middle of nowhere , but if you are anywhere within the 20 mile <unk> must go ! today i tried the take-out building for lunch / 1 and the service was great ! very nice and knowledgeable about the menu . btw
4 thoroughly enjoyed splitting a small house salad and a small pizza today ! great amount to share for lunch with left overs . started with the house salad that has roasted red bell peppers , fresh mushrooms , cherry tomatoes , crisp lettuce and tossed with a tasty italian vinaigrette
3 if you do n't want to wait , get here before 5 or after 8:30 on the weekend . by <unk> they were waiting outside the door ! i have to agree with nicole on the pepperoni , feta , mozzarella ... it 's a perfect combo . thin crispy
4 i loved everything about my experience at firebirds ! i was with a large group that sat in a private room and we had a <unk> menu to choose from that was very tasty . started with an appetizer of chips , salsa and really good guacamole . 2nd we
4 sick , need the best chicken noodle soup that mom did n't make ? come to jason 's ! plentiful moist chicken , plump egg noodles and perfect broth are available everyday for $ 4 something a bowl . sick or not i 'll drive to pick up a bowl
4 yummm ! a quick salad -lrb- my favorite is the mediterranean -rrb- and iced tea on a hot day , it 's always fresh and the staff is always fab ! i still rate it the best lunch spot on my list . if your one to partake in dessert
2 dear families , stop bringing your children here to play in the aisles , run into me , and throw things . if you ca n't afford <unk> - do n't come here . i 'm here to shop , not navigate around your <unk> children , then again apples
4 i love this place . everyone i know raves about it , and every item i try is out of this world ! i recommended it to a friend , unfortunately he does n't understand the appeal of fresh authentic ingredients and the rustic charm of the place . he
2 interior lighting has been <unk> , thus losing the <unk> and dim feel that i craved so much from delux . liquor menu is way out dated , staff made no effort to compensate . prices have gone up . service is consistently inconsistent . there 's a ton of
2 another case of `` i just do n't get it . '' also , another case of there is n't a 2.5 , so it 's not really a 3 nor is it a 2 . i 've been to at least three different locations ... not bad , just
2 probably should be a 3.5 . last time i was there was restaurant week . food was good , but firebirds was better . wait times here can be long . .
3 very good . if you want biscuits and gravy , get the half order . or get the on off the menu that comes with a meat and some eggs . point being ... lots of food either way . i 've never finished <unk> and eggs here ... ever
3 i 've been here several times now and it 's actually pretty good . the last time was in the for <unk> restaurant week . we ordered off the prix fixe menu . good value , good choices . 1st course . shrimp cocktail . good , albeit small shrimp
1 possibly closer to 1 . my family has eaten here for as long as they 've been in business . mostly i really like the place . i can remember having <unk> and eggs and coming no where close to finishing it . but i 'm afraid those days have
2 probably a 3.5 in reality . always a wait ... best advice , get there before 530 . food is good , but i 've found it to be overly salty .
3 awesome food at a decent price . stopped in today for dinner because i 've never been and olive garden is too far to drive in rush hour . glad i stopped by ! you get a free foccacia bread -lrb- freshly baked and very light and fluffy -rrb- with
4 i 've been meaning to go back to this place for over a year now but i finally did today . got the same thing i did the first time - meat lover 's omelette with added hollandaise sauce - and it was still great . fast , friendly service
3 went in here right before lunch to try it out . got an indian taco -lrb- which does n't feel pc but since it 's owned and staffed by native americans , i guess they can call it what they want -rrb- with a drink for just over $ 5
4 got the boxty , a jar of coffee -lrb- refillable at 10 % off -rrb- , and the day 's special lemon tart . the food came out super fast and it was so good . <unk> boxty -lrb- 2 -rrb- with shredded apple and a sweet butter on top
3 had to come back but was a little too hungry to wait for the baked french toast . soon ! this time , i tried the ham , swiss and spinach sandwich which came on ciabatta with a side of potatoes . the spinach still had the stems which i
2 first off , my burger and tater tots were great . i got the large <unk> burger which is a hamburger patty topped with bbq pulled pork - <unk> of meat overall . it came with cheese on a brioche bun and i could only finish half ! the sweet
4 super friendly , fast service . cute cafe with lots of art and natural light . i got the tomato basil and brie frittata with potatoes and sourdough toast , a side of bacon , and a coffee all for $ 20 after tip . the frittata was larger than
2 the burger itself -lrb- daily special : $ 10 for angus , cheese , ranch , bbq sauce and an onion ring -rrb- was great but i 'm not sure what constitutes it as a $ 10 burger . also split a side of sweet potato fries - not the
1 this place is supposed to be super famous for their pies , even appearing on national television shows and places in phoenix get the pies imported down . however , i could n't see why . i 've had some great pies and while my banana creme pie was pretty
2 went in for lunch and got two tacos - one chicken , one pork . the menu is a little confusing and you 're stuck <unk> at the chalkboard on the ceiling while the workers stare at you , which is weird and not too flattering . i 'd much
4 just got back from a great lunch ! i got the 1/3 lb . burger with cheddar and bacon . overall , it was a little greasy but nothing less can be expected from a great burger place . the bun was delicious and the burgers were obviously <unk> ,
3 so , after a disappointing trip to the <unk> deli , which was sadly closed , we ended up at joey 's . and it was awesome . chicago styled food , included italian beef and dogs , sadly , no deep dish , and no gyros . this is
1 yardhouse is interesting . great beer selection , but usually overpriced , too rich , too salty , meh food . go for brews , maybe an appetizer , sit at the bar .
1 i 'm really surprised that so many people love this place , especially when there is better middle eastern food all over this town . first off , i did n't really know who worked here , and who did n't , and thought it was especially rude of the
4 finally . a vinyl store in arizona ! i have been going to rhr since they first opened , as `` the flagstaff guy '' . since then , the store has gotten more awesome as time goes on . the selection , the staff , all of it is
4 fast service ! if you want to grab some fantastic food like a calzone or pasta and have limited time ! this is the perfect place for you ! people with 30min to an hour for lunch it 's perfect ! they also have my favorite local brew santan brewing
1 service continues to get worse . . what is it with this place , i am really really trying to like them ! they are a great local place i want to keep frequenting , but if i have to continually remind them what 's in their antipasto platter .
3 this may be the coolest market place arizona has ever seen . this whole foods is truly a market . inside this store is contained an organic grocer , a deli , bbq food restaurant , wine & beer bar , cheese shoppe , <unk> bar & , wait for
3 i love how big the seafood section is !! and its very fresh ! they always have what i am looking for in making asian meals . their prices are fair and the lines are speedy ! lee lee 's needs another location ! closer to me in the tempe/scottsdale
2 i go there when they have their specials going on . . they are a little pricey , a little bland ... but its close to my location so i ca n't complain . i 've had better , so they would be average .
1 we had the angus sliders , grilled cheese sandwich and buffalo chicken sandwich . they all came with bacon on them - good quality and thick sliced but overcooked . we drowned the sliders with ketchup to try to get some <unk> and seasoning into them . . the buffalo
3 we tried the pig dip sandwich and the salmon flatbread . the flatbread and bread for the sandwich is made in house and you can tell . the flatbread is actually very fluffy and more like pizza dough than other flatbread dishes seem to be . i 'd definitely try
3 the gyro is good , the fries are ok but borderline salty , and i like that they give you the tzaziki on the side . the only bad thing is the price - 5.95 for the gyro , 7.95 for the combo . i 'll go back , but
2 went for dim sum and enjoyed it immensely . the worst thing about it was the wait staff was n't very attentive and did n't do much except refill the cups when they noticed they were low -lrb- which was n't very often -rrb- . the dim sum was plentiful
3 we kicked off restaurant week here and had a great time . the ambiance is great and they have music that can be a little loud but definitely not as obnoxious and distracting as some other scottsdale establishments . for first course we had spinach salad and the lamb slider
0 this place definitely does not do food like kittens do cute . . so we got the luis -lrb- ? -rrb- basically a shaved meat sandwich with mac and cheese <unk> for fries and the trio of chips and dip . the chips were salted very <unk> - some chips
0 it does n't help that the evening ended with me telling the manager/owner exactly what was wrong with all the food that i had tried there and him walking back in shaking his head in a surprisingly unprofessional manner . he tried to tell me this food wins awards every
4 this is the best pizza place i 've found in phoenix so far . truly one of the <unk> . i think they have a <unk> brick oven ? not sure if its a rumor or not ... but something makes their pizza delightful . very good new york style
2 i used to think this place deserved at least 4 stars but with the new happy hour specials -lrb- 1/2 off appetizers and <unk> , 1.50 some kinda shredded meat taco that you can get at <unk> for a buck <unk> -rrb- its gone down to a meh . .
3 butterfish <unk> was as great as ever ! also tried a fancy roll this time and sashimi platter . its awesomely fresh . i was actually impressed by the freshness of the fish . its expensive , the furniture is uncomfortable and something about the place is just douchey or
4 we 've been back a couple times more since and both times we 've gotten the cheese platter . its a little pricey at $ 18 but i would highly recommend it . last night we tried the halibut and the salmon . both were absolutely delicious and cooked perfectly
4 we got to try a lot of things because we had a <unk> fixe dinner living social voucher . it was awesome ! first , its nice to have attentive waitstaff that 's attentive as well as knowledgeable about the food . always positive , no attitude - we all
1 this place seems to want to get rich off being featured on food network . there 's a big banner out front now and there are pictures all over the place of the owner -lrb- i 'm guessing -rrb- and guy . anyway , this is why i decided to
1 overrated . i got one of the `` supreme '' hotdogs or whatever which was a dollar more -lrb- $ 9.50 ish -rrb- . it sounded good , brat cooked in beer , covered with <unk> and bacon . the brat was as big as a <unk> finger and the
0 i finally decided to check out modern steak on my birthday to see if its as good as some of the other fox restaurants are . we sat in the lounge so we can check out the happy hour , although i knew i wanted a steak for dinner .
2 first off , i feel bad giving this place just three stars . after reading all the reviews , i was really hoping to like it a lot more than i did . i 've heard for months from friends and fellow yelpers about how awesome this place is ,
2 great drinks ! i really like their selection which ranges from house margaritas to fruit infused tequila drinks to <unk> ! came here for a birthday dinner . when i saw the menu , i thought to myself . `` hmm this is stuff you can get for under 5
2 i once came here for my friend 's bday dinner and got excited when checking out their beer menu . if you like beer like me , then you may get giddy . it kinda reminds me of a lesser known yardhouse . it 's got a huge beer menu
3 i second sarah 's review . try the <unk> <unk> and ron 's special southwest eggs -lrb- they come with nearly <unk> potato pancakes -rrb- . do n't forget to hit the atm -- there 's a wells fargo at <unk> and camelback .
4 <unk> <unk> : i thought i 'd reviewed this place in 2005 . the public area is probably about 600 square feet , but every inch is jammed with <unk> crescent / mediterranean goodness . this is a bakery , restaurant , and grocery . the restaurant part of the
3 iain is right -- wahsun has some very creative business hours . i shop at the sprouts in the same shopping center , so i 'd only been shut out when trying to grab a menu . no big deal , but kind of mysterious . i thought i might
4 wow . this tiny slice of gelato heaven is next to la grande orange . i do n't even much of a sweet tooth and i 'm thinking about it at 3:00 am . the place is run by an italian couple who obviously know their stuff -- the gelato
3 get there early or in off hours , because this place - from what i observed - can get insanely busy . i just happened to come on a sunday morning when there was a sort of `` lull '' but that quickly changed . we ordered our breakfast at
3 when i first walked in to this place , it felt like a sushi restaurant - the colors , the giant movie screen of ocean water being <unk> on the wall , etc. . i found the food to be excellent . i had the turkey burger , which came
3 only reason i did n't give it five stars is that it is hit or miss depending on who you get . i have found 2 ladies here that i love , the whole experience is very relaxing and pampering . as long as i can get in with one
1 this place use to be my go to favorite bargain store however things have changed . word got out and the <unk> <unk> have taken over this place . they are crazy !!! trying to compete with them is impossible as they clearly are `` friends '' with those that
3 next to tj , this is my second favorite place for groceries . they have a huge selection of vitamins and beauty care and the staff is very knowledgable in this area . the best deal here is their sandwiches at the deli , they use high quality boars head
4 this is such a great shopping center , tons of good store . and did i mention that it is beautifully decorated and even better at the holidays ? love just going here in a date on the weekends with the hubby , lots of good places to eat including
4 ok so this place is <unk> far east , but for those of you lucky enough to live in the far east valley you are so lucky to have such a great place so close to you ! such a cute , cozy place . . and the food is
3 feeling adventurous , we grabbed some kirin and headed down to hana . 1 -rrb- we started with the green lip mussels . incredible ... best i have ever had . no exaggeration . they were great . 2 -rrb- next we tried the lobster roll special . awesome .
2 great sports bar . awesome wings and pizza . giant frosty mugs of stella make me happy . my only complaint and hence the 3 stars was the waitress would n't take my dinner order until they had my credit card in hand . . huh . . what !!
3 i tried scramble for my first time this morning ... got ta say ... loved it . we had the brizza -lrb- breakfast pizza -rrb- eggs benedict ... both dishes were great . the place is ultra clean with a modern touch . the quality was great and prices were
1 so , unfortunately , last time we ordered from boombozz , it was not good ... maybe it was a bad night , but i have to update my thoughts to be honest . the wheat crust was horrible ! it was like cardboard . very flat & not at
0 * sorry no re-entry * sorry no re-entry * sorry no re-entry * i ca n't believe that no one has commented on this very important note -lrb- totally worth mentioning again if i did n't see it -rrb- ! we were 1st timers -lrb- our mistake , i guess
3 so we just went here to see our friends art exhibit . -lrb- who is showing the entire month of june - you must go see jeremy <unk> 's display & purchase some of his cool art pieces -rrb- shameless plug for a friend ! but on to the film
3 great date night spot . casual and warm . pizza is solid .
3 pizza was one of the best i 've had since i 've been in phx . <unk> space with cool lighting . bar setup was great and drinks were on point .
3 the owners have the food down for sure . they own a restaurant in san francisco and make thai that mirrors true thai cuisine . service was slow but i think they were just understaffed that night .
3 we met some long lost friends here last night . fast and efficient service . the only issue was that music was to start at 9:00 pm ... we left at 10:30 and the music still had not begun . at least we were able to chat with our friends
2 keep an eye on the register ... i do n't shop here often but when i do , they always over charge me ! as if their prices were n't high enough to begin with !
4 very nice environment . i would definitely go here again . the bartenders really know how to make some luscious specialty drinks !!
3 although it was a bit difficult to find , once we found it , we were pleasantly pleased . the meal was worth the menu prices and the service was decent . be sure to ask them to validate your parking . the only reason i did n't give 5
1 i think the `` soup nazi '' runs the counter service . yes , it 's always good to find a good jewish deli , especially here in phoenix . and maybe a little big city attitude adds to the ambiance . but is it necessary to provide such rude
4 i 've been to the <unk> `` memphis in may bbq festival , '' but honey bear 's pulled pork and bbq sauce is as good as any i 've ever tasted . since the owners of this place come from tn , i guess that should n't come as
4 i did n't think i could love anyplace as much as postino central ... but i stand corrected . after finally making it to the arcadia location , i must say that i loved it equally , but differently . arcadia seemed a little more comfortable with a relaxed vibe
3 went with a group of 10 on thursday night and the cast of glee showed up ! fun times : -rrb- the organizer for the evening forgot to make reservations - we were having dinner across the street and i frantically ran over to see about <unk> a table for
4 this is one of my favorite places - perfect for every occasion . i love the atmosphere , the seating , the wine selection , the pitchers of beer , the bruschetta boards - yum ! , the salads , the friendly staff , the lighting , the music ,
4 i love this second location in the royal coffee series as much as the one at the market ! since it 's summer - i thought i should mention that the iced coffee is so smooth and amazing that you do n't even have to add anything to it !!
3 this market will always be near and dear to my heart . i love the the midweek open-air market on wednesday nights - even though it is considerably smaller than the saturday market , it 's a convenient and quick stop on my way home from work i i need
4 oh my goodness , ice cream cookie sandwiches ! and again ... oh my goodness , ice cream cookie sandwiches ! and not just plain old ice cream cookies -- giant , homemade cookies -- a few different types . and you get to pick which cookies you want -lrb-
3 i would have never know that that 's a wrap existed if one of my coworkers had n't known about it and suggested lunch there after a press conference at the capital . it 's seemingly a little shack , but inside it 's very clean -lrb- aesthetically to the
4 with family in upstate new york , i grew up with trips to ted 's while visiting back east . the charcoal grilled hot dogs always tasted sooo good . in high school , i discovered that ted 's had a location in tempe , only a bit away from
4 we had brunch on the patio . i like places that you do n't have to wait for what seems like forever . i tried a little bit of everything at the table and it was all really good . very comfort foodie . our server was attentive , i
4 i thought this sweet tomatoes was brand new when i walked it . very clean and everyone was friendly and attentive . the staff at this location are a class act ! the salad bar and it 's topping were well maintained and fresh . i especially liked their array
4 more like ... chez yummy ! what a quaint place . having been to paris i had high expectations and chez vous did n't disappoint . we tried the chez vous crepe , one of the sandwiches , the nutella crepe and creme brulee . everything was authentically delicious !
3 i do n't go out for breakfast often , so when i do , i want it to be goooood ... daily dose lived up to all of my expectations . they have so many options , but we went with the eggs benedict with turkey sausage and the berry
4 this place is the best mexican seafood i 've found in phoenix ! delicious chips with two kinds of salsas , plus they bring complimentary shrimp ceviche tostadas that are superb ! the camarones <unk> , one of their specialty dishes , is outrageously good ! you 'll finish all
3 white chocolate grill 's famous chicken salad is my absolute favorite salad in the world . i ca n't say much about the rest of the food , because i always get the same salad , but i 've tried things others have ordered , and they 've always been
1 in general , i do like oregano 's , and would give the chain as a whole 3.5 stars . however , the one time i tried this location , the service was pretty bad , it took forever for our food to come -lrb- when the place was n't
4 soooo glad to see yogurtland come to the phoenix area . this is my favorite yogurt place in la . . it 's a do-it-yourself place with about 14 flavors every day , some regular and some tart . they have amazing yogurt -lrb- some of my favorites are tiramisu
3 the new pita jungle in desert ridge is great , just like all the other locations ! this is not your traditional mediterranean place - they focus non offering healthy items at very reasonable prices . they have many of the staples of greek/mediterranean food , like gyros , chicken
4 i almost never give a chain restaurant a 5-star review , not because i 'm opposed to the idea but because very few are worthy . but bandera is just that good , from the upscale casual , relaxed and inviting atmosphere to the excellent service to the delicious food
1 scramble indeed . scramble away from this place and into your neighborhood ihop or village inn ... at least you 'll pay less for equally dismal food . i expected so much more from a new neighborhood place , especially one that 's gotten some good reviews and publicity .
2 we are from the midwest where you can find a barbeque spot in just about every corner . so moving to phoenix , we actually had to research and find a place . so we ended up in scottsdale old town at big earl 's . food - i had
3 we were shopping for hardwood floors and our last stop was arizona wholesale supply . we were starving and noticed the indian restaurant right next door , so headed in . the waitress sat us down and got us some water . there was no mention of `` would you
4 i spent the day at their spa and then got a 75 min massage . i do n't splurge often and do spa days about once a year . even though i have not been to many spas , i have to say , this is one of my favorites
3 really like the look and vibe of this place . friendly staff and good service . food was n't outstanding imo but it came out quickly . i think the atmosphere makes up for the so-so food . prices are reasonable . i 'd come back for brunch or happy
3 more like a 3.5 but i 'll bump up because it 's a cute , busy place with reasonable prices . the pizza crust is pretty good except the center still gets soggy . maybe neapolitan 's are like that because i 've yet to find one with a crispy
1 my first time here several weeks ago was great . my second time lost a lot of points . monsoon rains were coming and water <unk> from the ceiling onto our chairs and table . apparently the waiters did n't think a leaking roof was a big deal in a
3 pleasantly surprised at what i found after walking through the doors . yum . i <unk> the 2 taco plate size and got two additional street tacos -lrb- happy hour 3-6 m-f -rrb- , leaving me stuffed . the fried shark was great - awesome crunch with perfect texture while
3 great location with a nice patio and view of camelback mountain . wide selection of unique beers . the wings i had were pretty good . i was n't hungry enough to order the huge burger that looked awesome as it kept passing by . enough tv 's to catch
3 most of the food here is very good . oysters are fresh . i really enjoyed the combo pan roast . the gumbo was also tasty but had okra which i 'm not a huge fan of . the clam chowder was too salty , and i would n't order
3 four stars just for the happy hour drink deals . not much else going on here though ... pretty dead for a thursday night .
4 campbell and 40th is my favorite food intersection in phoenix so far . the food itself is probably worth 4 stars but i 'm going to bump it up for <unk> , our server who was great . prompt , efficient , friendly . this place is actually very reasonably
3 stopped by for a few hours to get some work done . definitely hipster heaven as everyone already pointed out . great atmosphere but can be pretty loud if you ca n't tune out sounds . internet was fast . i came during lunch rush so it was pretty packed
3 i 've seen this restaurant all over the country but never went because i thought it was pricey for what you get . fortunately , deal chicken offered a $ 100 <unk> meal and a bottle of wine for 4 people . definitely worth the experience for that price .
3 a splendid italian deli in scottsdale . i frequented guido 's when i lived down the street in scottsdale . the food is invariably fresh and tasty . the grocery selection of italian staples is fantastic .
3 hosted a dinner for a medium sized party here . the manager and staff did a great job getting everyone their drinks and food . noteworthy was the follow through on <unk> meals for several guests who had to leave shortly for the airport . i am giving three stars
2 went back to india grill today for the lunch buffet . at $ 10 the buffet was a good value . the <unk> was good as was the chicken curry . in addition to the curry there was a chicken <unk> that was very good . the food had alot

2 very nice atmosphere - dark walls , w / furnishings in deep browns and burgundy tones . loved the plush <unk> at the bar - very comfortable ! cool tunes , and while i really liked how it was very easy to converse w / the next person in the
2 good chicken pesto sandwich . such a tiny kitchen ! felt strange having to walk through it to get to the <unk> closet of a bathroom .
3 kyoto is one of my two favorite sushi venues in the valley -lrb- the other being sakana -rrb- . very good sushi , great portions , and decent prices . i like how it 's never about `` the scene '' here .
2 <unk> popped in here to see if i could spend some of the <unk> -lrb- ? -rrb- card i 'd <unk> in july . i took advantage of a $ 5 savings by purchasing a $ 100 gift card . i did n't find much to buy then , and
2 came here for dinner two weeks ago , after first sitting down at pappa <unk> 's a few doors down . after waiting more than 10 minutes there w/out a glass of water to pass away the time reading the menu -lrb- i could n't find anything that piqued my

3 have n't been back for many months -lrb- perhaps a year or more ! -rrb- , and i do n't know why . oh yes , now i remember ... so many restaurants , so little time ! happy hour apps specials are great ! most are under $ 5
4 first of all , many thanks to the awesome deb l. and her <unk> hubby michael , for hosting tonight 's uye at this elegant restaurant ! -lrb- it 's definitely `` date night '' material -- and not only for romantic couples ; i spotted a father and daughter
2 <unk> was craving for a chocolate croissant for a few days , so i decided to finally try the ones offered here . although it was only 2:30 in the afternoon , there were n't many pastries or desserts on hand to choose from ... i had my mind set
2 it 's been almost two years since i last visited star of india , and my absence is due to other reasons and not bec . of the food . some good eats i 've tried here are the chicken tikka masala , basmati rice , and chicken naan ,

2 <unk> took visiting family and mom to lunch -lrb- mom and sister 's choice -rrb- . ordered a lunch combo of nigiri and sushi -lrb- this came with soup and salad , as well -rrb- <unk> , chicken cutlet app <unk> , veggie tempura <unk> , and soft shell crab
3 <unk> checked out their happy hour - select apps $ 2.95 each ! however , no specials on the alcoholic beverages , with a quick glance at the <unk> <unk> prices of about $ 9 and up . thank goodness total wine and more was holding its grand opening -lrb-
3 my first and only visit thus far was many , many moons ago as part of a large meetup group . many of us started to gather outside around 7p . i arrived a little earlier since i planned on trying some bbq at the stand located outside the venue

2 i 've tried dining here twice . the first time i visited , the resto was so packed , i waited ten minutes and then left . the second time , debated on leaving , but stayed . had fried chicken , a waffle , cornbread , and the candied

2 <unk> my first visit at this herb box location - did n't know it was so much closer to where i live than that one at southbridge ! decided to sit outside since it was so noisy indoors ** and especially when the misters were on full blast outside .
4 love this theater ! wished i 'd known sooner that i could get parking tickets validated -lrb- up to 4 hours ! -rrb- . nice wide lobby , clean and bright concession stands and restrooms , and clean stadium seats . what more can you ask for ?
2 great chicken curry patties . unfortunately , it looks like they 're off the menu - all i see are spinach and tilapia patties . coco bread was <unk> tasty ! - and i loved its texture , and it , too , looks like it 's off the menu
3 before leaving home for work this morning , i emailed sweet republic to ask if any of the flavors offered this week are free of corn syrup since i was getting out early from work today . i thought i 'd leave it to fate to decide for me if
2 was fortunate enough to catch a great suns game -lrb- even though they lost in the end -rrb- about two <unk> ago courtesy of an acquaintance . nice seats , too . -lrb- $ 30 + for a seat in the <unk> sections ? i 'd rather get catering ,

3 my coworkers and i go to noodles ranch at least once per month and every dish i have had here has been quite good . the prices are reasonable , the service is good and we can get in and out in a reasonable amount of time for lunch .
4 excellent gelato , coffee , snacks and breakfast . i stop by often for coffee and a tiny sized gelato as often as i can . great stuff !
4 love this place . a low key , local spot to get some authentic vietnamese . not sure why there are such harsh complaints posted here . i 've been to the restaurant several times and the <unk> have been spot on ! even though it 's called the ``

3 not much to say here that has n't being said . pj is my staple restaurant for fresh , healthy mediterranean inspired food . avoid if you do n't like crowds though , it 's almost always busy .
3 love this spot ! the karaoke rooms are great -lrb- one of them even has a stripper pole -rrb- , bathrooms <unk> . drinks are super addictive . the sushi is of the more americanized variety -- but there are some decent options . plus , there is plenty of
3 4.5 stars , minus .5 for atmosphere . this is a low key spot -lrb- albeit crowded at times -rrb- with not much in the way of decor ... but the staff is friendly , and food is delicious ! . rarely do i compliment others on their fried chicken
4 we had high expectations and were not disappointed . we brought our own wine , made reservations and everything went smoothly . we were greeted at the door by the owner who introduced himself and seemed very pleasant which was refreshing . we were seated promptly and the server was

4 our favorite restaurant in town . great atmosphere . chef lee always gets it right !
1 we ended up going here cause we were in the area and craving sushi . i wish we would have drove a little further cause this place has gone down hill . i used to go here a few years ago and i use to like it . i guess
3 parking here can be a pain but once you get inside you can have the best chicken fried steak you will ever have . i have driven by this place for years and everyone i have talk to said its great . not sure why it took me so long
3 i was suprised at how much is on the menu . i was just expecting pita wraps and that is not the case . they have a pasta dish and hummus and all sorts of good stuff . i ordered the hot philly steak pita with onions and green peppers
2 bj 's is just ok . they have some good dishes and some bad . i do have to say there wings are very good and i could eat a lot of them . they are breaded . normally i 'm not in to a breaded wing but these are

3 been here a lot , like how you can do online reservations . restaurant is pretty nice and very big , it can get super busy though . the booths are big but the tables are not so big . the food is very good and the menu is huge
2 if i could do 31/2 stars i definitely would . went here with a friend to have some late-night pho . the deciding factor was , not only the fact that they had decent ratings , but they were one of the only pho places in the tempe area that

2 my husband and i have been here twice . the first was last summer during the late happy hour . the food was really discounted but still pretty good - the steak sandwich was especially tasty - although i would recommend avoiding the pizza , which had overly sweet sauce
3 mccormick 's is my new favorite spot for two of the things that make me the happiest : 1 -rrb- freshly squeezed and mixed margaritas ; and 2 -rrb- a happy hour that features decent and really cheap food . i could go without the uninspired main menu and the

3 i 'm not normally one to let a business ' really cool atmosphere or architecture influence my impression of the place more than its food or drinks -lrb- would i like the donuts at one of those stands with a huge donut shape on top more than any other donuts
3 i really liked my first experience at windsor . my sister and her boyfriend were in town last friday and we wanted to get our weekend started early with some daytime drinks and a great lunch . others have pointed out the decor , so i wo n't beat a
3 i 've been to padre 's twice now - once for a full dinner and a second time for a margarita and a bite . i really like the bar area , find the service to be friendly and attentive , and think that certain dishes on the are top-notch
3 my biggest complaint about pita jungle is its name , which makes the place sound more like a fast-food mediterranean joint like extreme pita than an upscale , healthy restaurant . in fact , even though i 've worked nearby for over three months now and driven by countless times
3 kids love this place . they can spend all day here . buy the membership its worth it , with just 2-3 visits you have gotten your money 's worth and you have a year 's worth of visits to go for free ! well , at least this is
1 average breakfast . the name said it all every plate contains egg in some form . i 'm not a big fan of eggs , i know crazy , why did i come to this place . well it was a group decision , apparently i did n't win .

2 like most of the rest of the people who have reviewed this place i 'd say it 's right in line with a-ok . really nothing special to write home about . not great , not bad , just another sushi place to eat at . location is great on

4 i have lots of good things to say about this place . great location , very clean , delicious food . all quite healthy as well . my daughter discovered this on her way home from work many years ago now . it has stayed true to itself all this
4 what a beautiful store and it even smells good . it smells like fresh fruit and vegetable to me . bring your own bag so that you can get <unk> cents off your total for every bag that you bring in . wonderful fruit ! wow , the best grapes
2 we had been wanting to come to this location and try it for quite awhile . too bad we came the night we did , because , we were not impressed at all . food was not hot when it came out , our server did not know any thing
4 they 've now upgraded all their tvs !!! all are now <unk> -- they 've gotten rid of all the small tube tvs they used to have and replaced them with <unk> . this place is now the premier sports bar in the entire valley !
4 great espresso , amazing service . sparse atmosphere but who cares when the coffee is this good . order a double espresso . you will not be disappointed . it is literally half the volume of a ` normal ' double espresso -lrb- served in a single shot espresso glass
2 4 star service 2 star food = 3 stars . the bfast potatoes were undercooked and obviously microwaved , not grilled . the bacon was just ok . the prices are high , both for the menu & the grocery . wi-fi is <unk> . when it goes out ,
3 lots of selection and good deals abound , however , most brands are <unk> . wish they had more <unk> produce & meats . mostly unhealthy , processed foods ... 4 stars because there 's always a good deal on something good , but this is not my regular store
1 small but quality selection of groceries . but , their grocery prices are generally outrageous . how do they get away with that ? why do they sell single beer bottles if you ca n't drink them there ?
0 no wifi ?!?! ouch !! super small tvs for a sports bar and also too few of them and they 're poorly placed . the zipps on bethany home is much better but still no wifi . wow .
4 this place is great for happy hour . not sure i 'd want to pay <unk> prices . free wi-fi , indoor and outdoor seating at the bars , cool design with private room upstairs that looks like a fun group setting . the veggie bowl on hh is fantastic
1 wow . extremely disappointed <unk> skewers -lrb- $ 5 for `` 3 '' -rrb- quantity & quality . very small portion , pieces and a lot of <unk> , very little flavor . greasy . i will not return .
2 had raw veggie salad as a wrap w chicken on gluten free wrap . it was barely filled and very few veggies . for over $ 9 i expected a lot more . the actual salad bowl is a much bigger portion .

3 i dig this spot ! i worked next to it for a few years and it gets better and better . the owners are actually greek and seem to know what they are doing . the garlic fries are awesome and my fave is the gyro plate , yummy .
2 on rare cold day in phoenix it actually was almost empty , but quality was great as usual very thin crust pizza with fresh ingredients , but after last pizza with olive oil that i actually has to remove with napkins it destroyed all experience and drop rate to 3
4 very small place a little difficult to find , but very good pizza , so far i think one of best pizza i had in phoenix
4 this is a very <unk> place . they have some really classic bbq and their sauce variety is awesome !! the meat is to die for and they have a nice variety of sides . the brisket was very moist and delicious as well as the pork . this place
0 dear bouncers at four peaks , so many people `` judge a book by its cover '' -- and for good reason -- the `` cover '' is the first impression that one gets of a business . at four peaks , you make for a terrible `` cover ''

2 pei wei is pei wei . you love it or you do n't . i think their food is pretty decent and they appeal to the masses , even people who are not fans of asian food seem happy here . its just good reasonably priced takeout . the ahwatukee
3 this is the stylish lounge adjacent to the cozy jamaican restaurant known as the breadfruit . i loved the vibe of this place as soon as i walked in the door . their list of <unk> is quite impressive so if you are a connoisseur then you simply must go

3 this young and <unk> restaurant is <unk> for great weather . the open concept bar feels like it 's been <unk> straight from san diego . they have a great selection of craft beers on tap with local wines to boot . given the soft opening , they are still
4 what can i say ... it was a really good happy hour . this is definitely a place to be seen as there was n't an empty table in the place . luckily we got seated right away on the patio ... heat lamps included ! the waiter was able
2 checking out the $ 20 brunch go for the ambiance and bring a camera . it 's a fun field trip to try to find or even get into the saguaro hotel . they 've done a great job renovating the entire property and has the feel of a big
4 it 's definitely a treat . i got to split one with a friend after eating at green and it was excellent . a nice alternative for avoiding dairy . not sure of the flavor , but pretty sure it had bananas and cookies . one is more than enough
2 we visited on a friday afternoon and caught the tail end of happy hour . also catching some tail was some guy who came in with a young lady who was clearly an escort . i was upset that our seating only allowed us to see , but not hear
3 we hit hula 's on a friday evening to grab dinner and a drink . the restaurant is just a ways from the light rail so , from a convenience standpoint , this is a plus . we had a couple themed mixed drinks and , like others have said
3 out after a friday baseball game with another couple , we were loaded up quite well and the ladies decided amsterdam was the logical place to go . of course -- cooperstown , dbacks , amsterdam ! being in my fan gear -lrb- sedona red jersey and slip <unk> -rrb-
2 turf is good . not really a place to bring to impress the hell out of people . good though . it always works as an `` i do n't know where i want to go to eat ... i 'll just hit turf . '' they recently added <unk>
4 ambiance , excellent food , a great selection of fine liquor . it is hard to get better than house of tricks . one of tempe 's gems that we can all hope will not be <unk> out of existence -lrb- i 'm looking at you tempe city <unk> !
3 i had been to bliss a number of times for brunch , the experience was excellent . however , when i went there for dinner that was the kicker ! this place is awesome ! sriracha aioli , i was thinking of ordering more stuff just to try dipping it
3 hard to blame the stadium for all of the sucky games i have seen here -lrb- <unk> when the <unk> are in town -rrb- . this really is a nice ball park . its also great that there are almost always cheap seats , and they have a damn good
1 i ca n't believe i am updating my review for bliss/rebar with a negative experience . the <unk> -lrb- which i think was the problem , bartenders have so much to do that waiting on 16 or so people can get tricky -rrb- was initially very responsive to our table
3 the coronado coney . it is one of the greatest things on a menu ! get it on saturday when you can get vegan chili on top , after all what is better to do with vegan chili than to put it on a giant hot dog ? the dog
2 want to get drunk ? i mean falling over , possibly having sex in public ... but you 're not sure if that really happened drunk ? this is the place . described aptly as `` 7-11 on acid '' the giant bank of alcoholic <unk> , er <unk> ,
1 i am pretty sure ted 's has its status as a go to place here in az because of nostalgia . there are many places out here that are really not that great but because growing up these poor bastards had no good food are way over-rated at this point
4 i had a great first experience at the brat haus ! danielle our server was extremely knowledgeable and attentive . we had the scrumptious pretzels , with a side beer brat , a spicy brat , belgian fries , , and the haus favorite burger . everything had sooo much
4 loved this place ! never knew a boxing ring , dance floor , ice cream shop , clothing shop , and restaurant could all be in one bar ! i was even more pleased to see a moscow mule on the drink menu . it only ran me about 7
4 i enjoy this place so much ! i have been a frequent customer and am rarely disappointed . i recently met a friend here whom had never been before . <unk> , turns out to be `` ladies night '' and our food and drink were half off ! i
2 great pizza at a decent price , with horrible counter service . a <unk> search of the word `` rude '' on this place 's yelp page will show 4 results , which does n't surprise me the least . make that 5 results now .
1 i have to say , i went to a lot of different <unk> 's establishments throughout the <unk> , when i was in military . it was the natural place to go when you 're a bunch of young , <unk> guys being shipped around from place to place .
1 my boyfriend and i came here on a saturday night jazz night once and i 've been here a couple of times for coffee . i really want to love this place but i just ca n't get into it . each time i 've been i have n't been
4 i love sidebar . it 's sleek , modern , and gives you the feeling you 're looking out the window and into another city . i have been several times and am never disappointed . they have a wonderful list of cocktails -lrb- my favorite being the <unk> palmer
4 `` shopping healthy and local is more expensive '' is a myth -- even when talking about our <unk> friends -- and noble beast proves it . in addition to all-natural , quality health pet <unk> that you will find for a lot more $ elsewhere they also have an
2 i have never been into soul food per se , but my husband woke up craving some chicken and waffles , and well , you can guess where we ended up . we were so pumped that there was kool aid on the menu , so we ordered that immediately
4 is it true that i have n't reviewed forefathers yet ? i am in serious disbelief . forefathers is like my favorite thing ever ever ever . for starters , the service is so wonderful here . it is family owned , so it definitely has a warm , inviting
4 i visited tempe farmers market a couple years ago when it opened for the first time . it was less than impressive and i had never intended to go back . fast forward to a couple months ago and my roommate and i decided to stop in because we were
2 the food and service are both fine here , but i 've experienced better . i love love love that this is so close to my house . my husband and i walk over there a lot , usually later at night to enjoy the late night happy hour .
3 i really do n't like hamburgers that much . i know this makes me <unk> , but it is what it is . i was at one point dragged to this place since a bunch of friends were meeting up and i was n't about to miss out on fun
4 went last night with a table of 6 . had a great time -- got to sample several different pizza 's and were impressed by the quality of ingredients used in the toppings -- i loved the sage and sausage combo , and that fact that the pepperoni was actually
3 copper star is a great example of adaptive use in the heart of the melrose curve . who would have thought that a building initially designed to provide fuel to cars would so work so well serving fuel to humans ? their coffee is locally roasted and , while not
2 the ruby room is a mid century gem . basically it 's a dive bar that has maintained a sense of class . great decor , intimate vibe , friendly attentive staff , and a lot of cool bands . the only problem is the sound system : overly loud
4 this place is friggin fantastic !! from awesome ambiance , super creative delicious food and tasty drinks . . sochu really has it going on . we tried a bunch of different dishes and just loved all of them . being as indecisive as i am , i love small
2 first spa i have treated myself to here in the valley and overall i had a pretty good experience . i got the hot stone massage and it was <unk> . the other amenities were just so so . it 's not very big but it is still very nice
2 so the b/f has been <unk> for awhile to check this out place and even though i was not really in the mood for `` bar food '' i gave in . inside is decorated pretty cool . the menu is creative in the naming and they do have a
4 love , love , love !! i love this whole little plaza they have going on here ! mekong supermarket is part of mekong plaza . the supermarket is huge . produce is very fresh ! large selection of fruits as well . good sake selection : -rrb- check it
3 i had a good time for my first experience at stand up live . like most comedy clubs in the area you have to be okay with the possibility of rubbing elbows with someone else . . space is always limited and packed full but other than that i have
1 dang , i hate writing low star ratings but i need to get my issues out in the open . also , let me just say the food was good and i was really looking forward to finally checking out lobbys , my low rating is based really on the
4 just as wonderful as its other location ... not sure why its called # 2 , it is pretty much identical to the other totties ... but either way i can get over the name dilemma because i love me some totties ! anything you get is good , you
4 i love this place ! good for all ages and relatively cheap , a win-win !! if you park in the heritage parking lot they win discount your parking ticket to only $ 3 bucks and its usually $ 12 ! another win ! we went and checked out <unk>
4 my go to japanese spot when i need a fix of yakisoba stat ! it 's just so good . my bf loves the fried rice as well . they have never messed up my call in orders and its always ready when i arrive . easy , quick and
4 probably my new fav greek spot -lrb- just wish it was closer to my side of town , but so worth the drive -rrb- . where to even start ... i guess by saying that everything was f * % $ ing delicious ! i mean everything . . the
4 yay ! i love when i get to write a good positive update on a place ! my second trip to <unk> on main was perfect ! we arrived early enough to grab a booth and stayed until the late night crowd showed up so we got to feel the
3 had a wonderful experience here from first drink to last bite . atmosphere has a nice chic upscale feel to it and the lighting is nice and cozy . we waited in the nice bar while we waited for our table . the orange martini they have is just heaven
3 sweet potato ravioli !!!!! absolutely wonderful . also tried the spaghetti carbonara and they did not mind adding eggplant to it for me , and it was just delicious as well . cute little place with an overall good food selection . they have an extensive wine list as well
4 well yesterday i was a total chicken junkie . i wanted more after i devoured 4 pieces . seriously the best grilled chicken i think i have ever had . yes , i had major munchies but this is beside the point . it was seriously beyond satisfying and i
1 do n't get me wrong , it 's a cute place for families and kids but the parking was a bit unorganized and the prices were a little steep for entrance and all the extras inside . we went for the pumpkin & chili party and i could n't believe
2 i 'm normally not opposed to greasy food , but i did n't like that my burger bun was soaked . do n't get me wrong , the beef and the fries were excellent . service was quick , staff was friendly , and their soda machine is awesome .
4 i 've been going to `` <unk> sea '' -lrb- that 's what the cool kids call it ... not really -rrb- for a long time , and even though it 's quite a trek to go there from glendale it 's always been well worth the trip . there
4 wow ... just thinking about this place and writing a review is making me hungry . i went in here wanting to try something different and ended up getting something amazing ! there are a lot of great menu options and i like that they give you a choice to
3 i love going to zipps ! i 've been to several in the scottsdale area but this one is most convenient . you know what you are going to get - good pizza , great chicken fingers , cold domestic draft beer , sports . if you are going to
1 for a place called `` grapevine '' i 'd expect the wine menu to be at least decent . i have gone to this place several times for food , drinks and karaoke - i enjoy the view from the upstairs patio -lrb- i highly recommend sitting there -rrb- .
3 sushi is great - service is good and each time i have dined there with my toddler , they have been great . they have a pretty good kid 's dish that my kid enjoys as well . the wine list leaves much to be desired -lrb- wine lovers have
1 sushi was so-so , the wine list was n't anything to make me want to go back . they seemed to have a lot of interesting looking cocktails but i prefer wine with my sushi . we were n't in a rush so i ca n't really comment of the
3 love this place ! try the sweet potato tater tots !! great pizza too !! go steelers !
2 this place is good they have a great selection of beer and wines . i will be bringing my mom back to try the crab cakes for sure as she is a fan and they were pretty darn tasty . make sure to try the garlic fries too - they
3 love this pizza - consistently good and you ca n't beat the pepperoni . our favorite is the white garlic pizza with pepperoni . the cheesecakes are awesome too . free pizza on your birthday if you sign up on their website . one negative experience with a waitress ,
2 first off , i have to say that i 'm not a beer drinker . hubby ordered the sampler -lrb- a small glass of each of their brews -rrb- and i did n't like any of them , even the peach ale . he liked most of them thought ,
3 came here for the end of the yelp shops local event in downtown scottsdale . the decor was super cute and all of the staff were friendly even though i 'm sure they were working outside of their normal hours . the menu included kicking spicy bloody mary 's ,
3 after driving past this place many times hubby and i finally went here for our anniversary , after seeing all of the positive reviews on yelp . we were looking for something a bit unique , with a similar feel to melting pot but without the $ 100 tab .
3 my friends and i went here for the first time last night and we were very happy ! their happy hour menu is fantastic ! we got the philly roll , crazy boy , spicy tuna tempura , and shrimp tempura . they were all really delicious and had sooo
2 food is decent . service is kind of lousy . and the clientele is grimy ... so grimy to where i have to sit outside to not be disgusted when i 'm eating .
0 the last time i came to this place was over 5 years ago and they had good food and good service . however , today was a different story . i wanted to take my best friend here for breakfast and here is how it went ... actually it didnt
1 i really wanted to like this place because i 've heard nothing but positive things about it . sadly , i did n't like it at all . we went here on a friday night with a couple of friends and i could n't believe i had never seen this
3 this place is pretty decent . i wish i knew more about indian food or culture to really enjoy it . but i do n't , whatever . their naan is amazing . it 's so flaky and buttery ! my favorite of course . their chicken <unk> masala is
3 my boyfriend and i decided on this place to celebrate our 3 year anniversary and we are pretty happy we did for the most part . the parts i did not like -lrb- why they lost a star -rrb- : entrance is through the kitchen . i do n't like
4 this is the best local sushi spot i 've ever been to ... and i have been to all of them . there is nothing like this place ... such a fresh , authentic , flavorful taste to every roll and all of my girlfriends agree . it 's such
4 fabulous place to go to on the weekends ! friday and saturday nights are perfect ... not too crowded , not dead either . bartenders -lrb- only the guys though -rrb- are amazing . they take your order fast and fill up your drink with the more than expected liquor
2 tried this place for breakfast over the weekend and it 's definitely not what i expected for a breakfast spot . you order from a selected menu and pay up front ; then , they give you a number and you wait at your table . their coffee is awesome
1 ahhh , i wish i did n't have to leave a less than fabulous review for this place . i so wanted to love it , <unk> i ca n't . let 's start with customer service : it was awful . the hostess seemed annoyed . our waitress seemed
4 we usually come to brio for dinner and drinks , and this time we decided to stop in for brunch -lrb- and drinks , haha ! -rrb- ... so glad we did ! i ordered berries & cream french toast and he ordered eggs oscar ... um , well ,
2 i 've lived in az since 2002 , and decided that it was finally time to check this out . one of my friends got tickets from work , so i went along . i was a bit surprised at all the `` extra '' costs that went on top
3 have heard about this place for a very long time , and decided to give it a try . it certainly lives up to the hype i 've heard . i got the `` best chicken sandwich '' and decided to upgrade from the chips . the sandwich was excellent
3 the cooking <unk> and artist . i was very excited to visit this concept restaurant that brings you a surprise every course . i loved the excitement it added to the experience . my husband is very picky and the couple we dined with are somewhat vegetarian and all left
2 bueno queso ... tex mex style . i like it a lot and it is 1/2 price apps before 6:30 . our service was super slow , but overall a descent experience . i enjoyed the wild mushroom <unk> .
4 oh <unk> farms how i love the . this update will be named tart lunch , as one of my favorite friends visited we sat for two hours and enjoyed every moment . <unk> had a special on girly drinks , so we each had a $ 5 raspberry champagne
3 went with some friends looking for authentic , while i was along for the ride with my two year old . i had cashew chicken with egg drop soup and sweet sour soup , plus a couple of egg rolls . hot and sour was ok , but the rest
3 i moved to scottsdale in may . this place made me miss the nice urban vibe of phoenix proper . it played `` hip '' music and made me feel more young and less like a middle aged <unk> mom . the patio was perfect , the mac-n-cheese with green
3 girls lunch and dinner at cask 63 proved to be very enjoyable . i think they do an excellent job of taking care of larger groups . the service was very attentive and both times the manager/owner has stopped by the table . some of my favorites on the menu
4 this place is a phoenix gem . the food is a great fusion of chinese and mexican . they serve it up is an amazing array of combinations . make you you get some of the samples that are always being offered . things to try : jade red chicken
2 i like ikea for many things and they carry many items difficult to find elsewhere like <unk> and <unk> covers . the furniture typically has to be assembled which is easy after you do one of an item . the first time through is invariably frustrating . the thing i
3 dude , this place is bomb . another gem found on yelp . i had the <unk> and the wife had the <unk> . the bobbie tasted like thanksgiving dinner . juicy shredded turkey on a bed of heavenly stuffing and smothered with cranberry sauce . primo , man ...
4 this is my favorite brewery in az . . the food is good -lrb- i had the socal burrito w / shrimp -rrb- and the beer is even better . i love all the beer , but my favorite by far is the devil 's ale . they serve the
4 this place is great ! the ice cream is sweet , but not too sweet , creamy and delicious . their ice cream is made from local ingredients and without preservatives . you can definitely taste the difference . by default , the ice cream is healthier ... yeah ...
3 the shoe dept. go there ... or maybe do n't go there so i can keep all the cute shoes to myself ! great customer service and i love that this macy 's is easily <unk> from the outdoors so i do n't have to go thru the mall like
1 i remember going to cpk years ago -lrb- in ny -rrb- and enjoying it . but i must say i was really disappointed . we ordered a roasted artichoke & spinach pizza , but it was just ok . maybe i 'm just comparing it to picazzo 's amazing puttanesca
2 <unk> , i love a chic restaurant ! this place is gorgeous . as other reviewers noted , this place is hidden away . and the complex is a maze , but when you finally make it to the restaurant , you are pleasantly surprised . it is very green
4 yup it 's confirmed ... rigatony 's is definitely a 5 ! we had the sweetest waitress nancy . this time we went for the chicken florentine , eggplant parmigiana & the carb smart chicken linguine . everything was delicious ! just found out they have a punch card so
3 i 've been coming here for several months thanks to the suggestion of you fellow yelpers ! all i get is the breakfast burrito w no meat -lrb- potato , egg & cheese -rrb- , so i ca n't speak to their other menu items . the breakfast burrito is
2 pretty standard fare for a simon mall although i dig the addition of the outlet shops . i 'm not a mall person so i did n't over <unk> . from what i 've gathered from arizona , there are a million malls to frequent so you can always find
3 upscale version of ycs . better seasonings and sauces available -lrb- yay for curry ! -rrb- . as a vegetarian it is harder to pack all the veggies in your tiny bowl here as compared to ycs though . the drink specials are awesome !
1 came here for takeout . i was <unk> out -lrb- yes , i said <unk> out -rrb- for some caribbean food -lrb- other than my own -rrb- . and the caribbean restaurants are few and far between out here . on top of that , i 'm a veggie .
4 i 've been to many movies here . friendly staff with yummy popcorn including my friend 's fave : kettle corn ! you have got to try the <unk> & <unk> theatres . i love being able to sit in a movie theatre and have my food delivered to me
3 i have been to jalapeno inferno a couple of times now and each time has been a good experience . my fianc and i both love very spicy food and jalapeno inferno delivers . the chips and salsa are very good and they have a selection of both flour and
1 tonight z ` tejas let me down . it is unfortunate because i love the food here . i booked a party for six for a reservation at 7:30 pm . we were seated right away in the upper level of the restaurant . our waitress came over right away
1 this mall has unfortunately gone done hill since my family moved to arizona 10 years ago . my sister and i used to come here and hang out back in the high school years and just spend time walking the mall and having a good time . i do not
3 firehouse subs is delicious . you really ca n't go wrong here . fresh bread , good quality cold cuts and melt in your mouth cheese . i have recently discovered the new york steamer which is pastrami and corned beef with provolone and italian dressing all melted together .
1 i decided to grab dim sum after i watched bizarre on the food channel and andrew was in china eating all these delicious chinese dim <unk> . typically , i go to golden buddha in the chinese cultural center , but i was recommended that great wall has better dim
2 i have not been here since late may when they informed their customers that they will be shutting down . i am glad to hear that they are staying open and making some renovations , because it sure needed it . do n't get me wrong ... i love the
3 it was my first time at la bocca and i was pleasantly surprised . mill avenue is not my usual preferred place to dine but after a fabulous performance at the gammage , i was hungry ! so hungry that i could n't wait to drive to eat . my
3 a stop on a -lrb- <unk> -rrb- friday afternoon to mj bread and tammie coe cakes left me very satisfied ! half the fun of visiting this shop is <unk> all the pretty cakes on display . while there were a few , there were fewer than i 'd hoped
3 fox got it right , again ! if you 're looking for a cool , trendy , <unk> place to eat , zinburger 's an awesome spot ! on a recent trip , i had the zinburger signature burger which was moist , tender and flavorful . even the soft
2 i 'd never heard of this place until i stumbled upon it today . the `` established by firefighters '' sign <unk> at my <unk> , so i had to stop in . it 's a few days post the 10th anniversary of 9/11 , after all . everyone who
3 looking for a light lunch at miracle mile delicatessen ? oy ! you wo n't find it here ! i was stuffed fuller than the turkey on my challah ever could have been . the `` special '' is described as a 1/2 sandwich and -lrb- either side salad or
2 sacks art of <unk> is a mix of southwest , mexican and modern decor . the salad was rather basic , and the acoustics rather loud . the restroom is really cute but could use seat covers and <unk> & mop . if your initials match the <unk> ones on
2 fair trade ? more like <unk> priced , as in , ridiculously low prices when compared to lux , lola , copper star , et al. . my espresso macchiato today was going to cost $ <unk> , but then the kind barrista asked if i was a `` teacher
1 just because the server will take back a poorly mixed drink or charred beans does n't make it a good place to eat and drink . the food at hula 's needs to be good and consistent , not just <unk> . on a saturday night , four of us
3 i completed the `` <unk> ' challenge '' and <unk> buddy was i <unk> ' . it was fun though . the only con : they make you pay for the challenge , like $ 20 for the wings , they did n't have our shirts , and your name
3 i love this place ! the tickets are cheap , the combo deals are perfectly priced , the theater is a cool retreat during summer months ... but they could use a credit card machine . that 's my only gripe . i love bringing the kids here though and
4 ok , i know the layout of the airport can be a bit confusing . especially if you are unfamiliar with sky harbor . however , once you know how things work this is a great airport given the amount of traffic and <unk> that travel though it . i
4 i have to agree with <unk> j. i too have only had the pho here . but each time i do it is awesome . the ingredients all seem fresh , and it is not too filling . the atmosphere is laid back and the service is great . definitely
3 it 's a great asian grocery store -- but the way things are organized by <unk> is frustrating . that 's because if you are looking for something -lrb- for ex spices -rrb- there might be 4 different rows with the same thing but different countries of origin . it
1 lee lee and mekong much better . unless you need a specialized korean item , this store is a waste of time .
2 i came on wednesday havana nights on their roof top patio , so i can not speak for any other parts of this big place . there is no cover and the dance lessons are free . dance lessons were held from 7 pm - 8:30 . two latin dances
3 - great salsa , especially if you mix the red and green together ; however , the chips are only mediocre - very tasty refried beans - amazing chicken mole enchiladas . that little kick they throw in is outstanding - the enchiladas <unk> were amazing . great green chili
3 starters : - grilled artichoke : not a favorite for the table , but a definite favorite of mine . very beefy and full of flavor - grilled calamari : wow . silky smooth with a hint of the grill and the white bean ragu , which i was skeptical
3 my wife and kids love this place . it is truly an amazing warehouse of every kind of candy in every color that a kid , young or old , could dream of .
3 the broth is still just ok , but the tendon is awesome ! huge , tender , and meaty .
2 great value . the hummus and chicken are decent . the beans are extremely bland . the service was very good and the space was not as cramped as the tempe location .
2 excellent for gilbert . truly excellent . for gilbert . the sweet potato fries were excellent . the wild salmon -lrb- i should have asked from which river -rrb- was a little dry , but the seasoning was quite good . five stars for the restrooms .
3 i usually avoid chains , particularly italian chains , like the plague . however , it was my mother-in-law 's birthday and this is her favorite place . so we go . and i was more than a little surprised -lrb- pleasantly -rrb- . the good : - great for
3 excellent new mexican food . better than average salsa . the shrimp rellenos were full of flavor . i was expecting more heat , but ended up with more flavor , which is fine in my book .
3 i like the darker , slightly <unk> interior and somewhat intimate <unk> booths on the sides . it 's a nice environment . service is friendly and food was reasonably good . the pretzels in beer cheese sauce were really good . the burger was above average , nothing special
3 i was n't sure what to expect going on , but overall i was pretty satisfied . the tacos are well done , with lots of interesting options influenced by different cuisines -lrb- think carnitas in dr. pepper -rrb- . mexican food purists would be turned off by this place
2 we have been here twice and the first time was awesome , lots of laughs , great service , delicious food . of course , i had a few at the bar before , so everything was fun ... the next time , we had dinner on the patio .
1 i think that i will have to go back and try zinburger again and not try the buffalo chicken sandwich . my bad . i am at a burger joint and should try the burger . the sweet potato fries were good , but did not enjoy the sauce .
2 we finally made it here for breakfast/lunch and i guess we will make there again some time in the future . the wait staff was quick to greet and get us our drinks and order . after that , it was awhile before the food got to us . the
2 this is the closest theater to me and sadly , it 's not up to par with other amc 's . it could definitely use a facelift , hence the 3 stars . coming from kansas city , amc 's were the best in that city so i was surprised
2 came here last saturday morning for breakfast before visiting the farmers market . after i was n't overly impressed with my breakfast before -lrb- see previous review -rrb- , i asked the guy at the counter what else he could recommend . low and behold he suggested the chickpea pancakes
2 my boyfriend surprised me with two night at <unk> for our anniversary . after having looked at the pictures on their website , i was pretty excited and looking forward to the trip . he made the reservation and i assume he mentioned when making them that we would be
1 though we ca n't be 100 % sure , i believe my fiance got food poisoning from the raw oysters he ate here a few weeks ago . we shared all the food that night with the exception of the oysters . he woke up in the middle of the
2 of the `` woods '' family , that being <unk> and <unk> , this is my least fave ... service is rather on the forgetful side and i found running to the bar and <unk> drinks a much more efficient enterprise ... kudos to the myriad big tvs with flat
4 loved this place ! i am a huge fan of the whole <unk> idea ... now i know this place has been around for a while , but this was my first time there and my wife and i were blown away . being half french , my taste buds
3 excellent bartender ! nice place . the food is a hit or miss , some is good some is not , most of the specials , stay away from . get the menu food , it 's much <unk> , but still be <unk> . the bagel sandwich is a
4 like the place ! has some covered parking with a menu on it so you can decide what you want before you go in , pretty cool . has a drive thru as well . you can place big orders ahead of time and go through the drive thru and
3 very interesting : -rrb- but thats what i love about chinese people and the way they run business ! i lived in china for a couple years and this place brings me back . awesome service even though the whole family and my server was eating at the same time
4 cheap ! delicious donuts ! it reminds me of the donut shops they have all over southern california . my girlfriend got one filled with whipped cream -lrb- not custard like a boston creme , but actual whipped creme -rrb- . open from 4am til 7pm ! not fancy and
3 i was vegan for 1 and 1/2 years until i recently <unk> . i think that america 's obsession with red meat and deep fried <unk> is the reason why we 're all fat . i 'm also aware that fully 18 % of all <unk> <unk> come from the
2 i love that tempe marketplace is here - it 's so convenient to have all of these stores so close to me . the movie theater is brilliant and the list of stores and restaurants is wonderful . it 's also in a beautiful area that will only become more
1 went during the day yesterday and was reminded why i do n't do that more often . the lunch special was cheap , but shrimp and whitefish lacked the whitefish and was basically just deep fried slices of potato and carrot . the sushi was <unk> and the service was
2 i 'll tell you what - wandering around this place looking at clothes gave me the feeling that none of this junk was ever sold at nordstroms . it all looked like <unk> lines of clothing . i 'm thinking the rack is to nordstroms what old navy is to
2 this will be a quickie . i stopped in last night with a friend to see if this place was any good and worth checking out again . we had already eaten , so we just had chips and salsa and a margarita . i plan on returning to sample
2 dirty , greasy , and cramped ... yet the place is oddly pretty trendy and popular . the waitresses are really hot . the food is pretty good , but it 's greasy and fairly typical . hearty portions served at least ... you wo n't go hungry here .
2 bless me yelp for i have sinned . it has been two and a half months since my last review . to be honest , i have n't really been going anywhere . however , i did make it to cr last week and decided to come talk about it
1 hey , let 's build a mall that will blend in with the surrounding landscape ... no , not the desert landscape , but the urban sprawl of north phoenix . this mall is huge ... a huge parking lot . you have to drive from store to store because
1 edible ... that 's how i 'll describe this food . i ate it - cleaned my plate even . i had a lunch special which was a <unk> and a slice . the slice was a `` <unk> '' as the waiter described it and swore most slices were
4 okay - i 've been going here fairly regularly and i 've upgraded this to a 5 star place . the food is awesome and the people here are rad . it 's one of my new favorites . i do n't know what i was thinking giving it a
2 fantastic place to take a visitor from out of town . the place is somewhat seasonal because you really should eat on the outside patio . it 's definitely a fun atmosphere and the food is actually good -lrb- sometimes -rrb- . i found the service to be nice as
2 this is my gym because i have an la fitness membership and it 's the nearest location to my house . i 'm locked into a deal where i pay only 99 bucks a year for life , so i ca n't really ditch it since most people pay much
2 i think i went on a bad night because i 'd say that normally the service here is a lot better than i described in my last review . they also changed the decor again . i 've since been back and was reminded that a good time can be
4 i remember as kid my older sister would drive me to one of the only gelato places in town in old town scottsdale . i do n't think this was it , but i know it 's near the same area . old town has changed so much over the
2 i 've only eaten there twice , but the food both times was very very average ... not reflected in the prices . at this price point , the food should be out of this world . the happy hour specials are decent and the atmosphere is outstanding , but
4 outstanding new restaurant in old town - looks like 3rd time 's the charm in this location . previous owner -lrb- s -rrb- had tried a few different things that apparently did n't pan out . well , the new owner of this spot apparently knows what 's up .
3 this is the only location i 've found that carries the one thing i actually like ... it 's the chicken caesar salad wrap . i love it . i 've had the same thing elsewhere , and at other places the dressing pools or drips and makes me want
1 ok - first off , i have to admit that this place had good - nay - delicious food . from pizza to pasta , boston 's did it well . that 's where the good times end . a few years ago , this place had everything going for
4 they have a chai tea drink called the himalayan hammer . it sounds like a sex position . it 's just as good as one . nuff said .
4 this is seriously the best gelato i have had outside of italy . maybe that is because it is owned and run by italians ! that should be enough , but they carry over 30 + flavours of gelato even whipping up some unique seasonal flavours such as green apple
4 oh my god . was this a win or what ? i enjoy spice and indian food a lot , but i 'm always nervous about cleanliness and getting an explosive asshole later in the evening . however , my experience at tandoori times 2 left me with no worries
4 i drove past this place soooo many times and i am now kicking myself . this is possible the best pizza i have ever had . the decor of the restaurants is amazing and they had a fantastic menu . the service was amazing ! just a great place !
1 i do n't get it ... i feel like i missed the memo . food is <unk> - i do n't care how drunk you get , you 'll still know it stinks ! rainy day margarita is my one good memory that i can take away from this place
3 always amazing sometimes the chicken is suspect -lrb- fatty -rrb- . but i love the tortillas with scream -lrb- sour cream -rrb- . i would go here more if it was closer to my house . sign up online for a free one on your bday .
1 the chix parm is the only thing worth getting . everything else is prepared too far in advance like the chix for pasta is prepared earlier and warmed up . chix parm was good just very thin . it 's a chain i should have known better .
3 solid 4.5 great lunch spot and amazing gyro .
3 i used to come here once a week but one time gyro meat was undercooked and nasty . i have n't been back since . but , the <unk> cheese with the pita is amazing .
4 i love the hot and sour soup it amazing !!!! service is always an a + + + + also lunch specials are cheap and taste great !!!
4 went for lunch after wanting to go here for months and i was impressed . i got the pan roast combo . it was filled with crab , crawfish , and lots of shrimp . it was almost like a soup but thicker . seafood in every bite . i

3 solid chicken sandwich and solid veggie sandwich . i 'm not a huge fan of the patio does n't really feel like you are outside cramped between other buildings . great happy hour and a ton of wines by the glass for reasonable prices . spicy nuts are tasty .
1 in short an unimpressive independent italian restraint in a overly italian saturated area . over the years this location has changed names and ownership many times , and i decided to give the current <unk> of this place a try . the inside has gone upscale , with <unk> on
2 it was a warm after thanksgiving friday . i was one of the lone people at the office , my hunger grew and at each attempt for food i was <unk> as many places were closed for the day . however i lucked out and found this place . cute
3 one menu lunch or dinner , nice views of the fountains especially at night , and a decent south western ambiance . your standard is a bowl of chips and salsa . not just any chips , a <unk> sweet potato , flour with a sweet <unk> dusting and corn
2 st <unk> ? who or what are you ? a date place ? no too noisy . a <unk> wonder , no they do n't serve beer in a can . so what is it ? i had a full meal here and i can not fully place a title
3 who does not like smashing someone else 's nuts and then having them clean up the mess ? this is exactly what you can do at teakwood 's . some bars of pretzels , some have trail mix , but only teakwood 's has buckets of peanuts in the shell
3 i know what i like and it does not often take me long to make up my mind on a menu , however i spent over 8 min decided and could have spent more . the reason , so many tempting items , i usually just t need to decide
3 great ambiance , good location , decent food and mediocre parking . down town had been lacking a trendy <unk> take on vietnamese food , and this nicely fills the void . the menu is full of rolls $ 4 - $ 5 <unk> mi 's $ 8-10 and pho
2 i saw the olives , however the ivy was nowhere to be seen , just like the real value . to put it simply you are paying for decore and location , the quality ingredients do not match the prices . we had a veggie <unk> $ 11 and the
4 there are two tricks here . show up early , and the car bombs are only $ 3 . my friends and i came in for dinner before a concert . we arrived to a empty place at <unk> by 6:00 all but a few seats were taken . keep
4 first note the costco food court only accepts cash . with that said it takes very little cash to have a great meal . i stop in here frequently for a quick lunch or dinner . the hot dog and a soda combo is only $ <unk> with tax .
3 wow , i went in wanting to not like this place and i really liked it . unique drinks including a pineapple wine . which has a pineapple nose and a pino <unk> finish . a few veggie options and the best edamame in town ! the edamame are not
3 a hidden tempe gem has opened up a store in cen pho , and changed my lunch time landscape . the menu is the same , with sandwiches , salads , bowls and burgers . prices are $ <unk> for most items , a bit steep for the amount of
2 12 inches of doughy glory covered in <unk> red <unk> sauce . i sit here at my desk sipping my to go cup of hot sauce thinking about what to say and how to rate this place . the food was good , the prices were decent -lrb- i 've
3 i like variety in life , to get the variety i crave i visits costcos other than the one that is a mile from my house . this is what brought me to <unk> today . as costcos go this one can get quite busy on the weekends , its
2 i returned here <unk> a birthday lunch with a co-worker . i was a bit sad to see the tuna sandwiches was removed from the menu leaving me with the $ 13 tuna plate option . it comes with two decently sized cajun pieces of tuna , on a bed
1 apparently something is healthy if you can put the words `` organic , '' `` wild , '' or `` natural '' in front of each main ingredient . at least this is what true food kitchen would have you believe . naturally i went here with a good friend
4 it is a big hot pocket ! at least that is how i tried to describe it to my friend before we went tonight . my friend and i went there tonight for a to go order , to take to our new favorite brewery . there is no to
1 look its a fad and this time i have to do the work and play guess the price ! this was my first venture into the self serve yogurt world outside of 3rd rate work <unk> . and i did not like it . many <unk> toppings , a seemingly
2 what does one do when they need to grow and the neighbors are gone ? knock down a wall and pretend nothing happened . this is what la tolteca has done . the menu has no real surprises . burritos , and the other usual fair . prices are a
3 good beer and wood fired pizza , seems like a winning concept . i love micro brews , and this place has a great in house selection . in <unk> they have a wine list and brick wood fired pizzas . the pizza was good , but the dough was
3 i am a pretty pleased pizza snob . the taste of the pizza is passable which is rare for az . . the service is fast even when ordering a large pie , selection is wide and the prices are very reasonable . the location is a pro and a
3 some things are just better when done outside , this includes dining on the great patio at chelsea 's kitchen during my visit i did not see chelsea , if she is even real , however i did see the kitchen and most importantly , i sat on the vine
4 gluten free options ! awesome italian <unk> drink ! not to mention i found out you can <unk> at the espresso bar and skip that long line on the weekends ! definitely going to be back here again for breakfast ! p.s. the owner is very friendly
3 hands down , best gluten-free pizza in my 6 years of gluten free .
2 went here tonight , a first friday evening around 8pm . only 3 other tables were full and about 12 people in the bar . the waiter was a little slow and did n't ask to refill or anything till we were done eating ... unusual . after the $
3 this place is great for lunch if you are in a hurry . tons of seating and minimal wait time . parking is okay though you probably will have to settle for the street or dirt lot across the street . the portions are huge ! i would dare say
4 i love to <unk> a bite and then shop here . the falafel wrap is great . price is amazing for such a filling item . my husband and i like to eat a few of the items when they come fresh out of the oven . everything tastes homeade
3 tempe pub staple , as the phoenix area goes , casey moore 's is pretty good . the atmosphere is hipster , arty - but you wo n't be judged when you go . the patio is great during nice weather and the food is good enough . the wait
3 one of my favorite places to eat/drink on mill ave. pizza , especially the <unk> -lrb- little spicy -rrb- and the garden . their bruchetta and med . plate are both fantastic too . the outdoor patio is fun for people watching during cooler weather .
2 it 's exactly what you would expect from an outdoor outlet mall . we arrived right at opening around 10am on a saturday and it was already getting crowded ... the coach store had a queue and the line wrapped around the side of the building . the road to
4 i have been here a few times and had a great experience every time . the food is wonderful -lrb- creative , fancy yet totally edible -rrb- , the ambiance is cozy , sophisticated and classy , and the service is spot on . the cheese plate is delicious and
2 5 stars if you are rich and love to throw your wad around 1 star if you are on a budget and think plastic surgery is terrifying 3 stars if you enjoy window shopping , <unk> at the snobbery and mock the fact that some people will spend $ 3000
3 i am such a huge fan of grimaldi 's ! you know a pizza is amazing when you can do without any toppings and regular ole cheese tastes fantastic . the coal oven creates a lovely crisp crust and perfect melt to the cheese . the antipasto plate is delicious
1 oh dear lord , this place scares me . i think fat 's is the perfect place for a bar crawl for a 21st , tourists who do n't know any better , bachelorette party nightmare , or a themed night out where everyone <unk> its <unk> and that <unk>
2 i was asked to pick up a red bell pepper . so , i head over to whole foods market . great , they have a bunch of them ... whoa ! $ 7 a pound for a red bell pepper ? i 'm shocked . `` goodness , that
1 sigh . the taco plate was skimpy and bland . i do n't mind getting a small portion , but do n't charge me $ <unk> for it . get ready to <unk> your <unk> tacos in hot sauce . maybe try a burrito instead ? one word : disappointing
3 i 've got nothing but positive comments for the rosemary chicken sandwich . it was truly one of the best sandwiches i 've had , and i 'll be back to order it again , even if i have to take the light rail to get there .
2 came here on a groupon whim . i 've been around the pho block a few times , so i was a little surprised with how quickly the bowl was brought out after ordering . maybe all the other places i 've frequented were really busy , but pho ao
1 stopped in here before a diamondbacks game , because we had just learned that the copper door -lrb- located a few feet away -rrb- was no longer in business . hey , it really smelled like a bar ... but it is a bar , so good job ! the
3 this is the first establishment i 've patronized solely based on yelp reviews . i was not disappointed . even though the $ <unk> specials were plastered near the front door , i opted to order off of the wall . my wife ordered the <unk> beef and i ordered
1 we ended up visiting this restaurant one day , after our barista at starbucks mentioned how the patrons at her ` other job ' were n't tipping well , forcing her to hold an alternate <unk> at the coffee giant . so we show up later that evening . anyways
2 been for happy hour and sunday brunch . had a very respectable bruschetta the first and a yummy eggs benedict the second . while everything was good , nothing really stood out and it was just a little stuffy for my taste . a sweet outdoor patio and open windows
1 just another <unk> place with average food at best . six bucks for `` made-to-order '' potato chips which , after <unk> the waitress , we came to find out are just potato slices that they fry when you order them and not before . even more comical were the
3 this place is pricey , but the taste is great . they have a lot of different options as far as their cupcakes go . they do a great job of making everything look cute too . i got their lemon cupcake with raspberry frosting . i am not a

3 where i come from outdoor malls are the norm . santan does n't get any extra props for being outdoors . it does get credit for being very clean and well kept . it really is an attractive outdoor shopping area . there are a lot of great options for
3 this is a standard place to celebrate birthdays . the drinks are delicious especially the kiwi and acai specialty drinks . the rolls are over $ 10 , but they are unique and tasty . the environment is very cool and the location is great . parking is bad just
4 i love the ambiance of this place . the rustic feel , the soft glow , the smell of delicious food . how can you resist ? i ordered the rosa pizza . it had arizona pistachios , red onion , rosemary , and cheese . it was absolutely perfect
4 this is by far the best movie theater i have ever been in . why you may ask ? 1 -rrb- reclining chairs 2 -rrb- soft blanket and pillow -lrb- i am usually cold in theaters so this was awesome -rrb- 3 -rrb- plenty of leg space 4 -rrb- it
4 so i first thought this restaurant is located in a mall , dunno about how good it can get . then i walk inside and wow i am blown away . it is a <unk> restaurant . the furniture , chandeliers , wall paper , even bathroom is beautiful .
2 this is a typical ` <unk> soaked in sauces ' chinese delivery place , but they are quick and friendly . the price is reasonable and there are n't many areas one can complain about . i ordered , as per other user 's suggestions , the honey garlic chicken
3 crackers and co. is always a treat . like other <unk> have mentioned the california eggs benedict is absolutely awesome . also like other <unk> said , parking can sometimes be a pain . the location in south tempe usually has less people , but as with any breakfast place
3 guys this is one of the few places that pays attention to their customers and listens to what they write on here . they are definitely stepping their game up adding more great food to their menu and also expanding their selection of fine top shelf liquors . this place
2 i lived in italy for 2 years so i know what real italian food is and this is not it , but i go there expecting that . one thing i do n't get is that they have a special culinary school in italy and they teach chefs how to
4 great place , donuts made fresh everyday . the owners are great , it is the best .
4 great place , great staff and owner is wonderful the food is the best charro beans the pork and everything .
0 dirty and filthy , food is awful , place filled with bugs and roaches . i do not care how long they have been around , they are not jewish cooks or food <unk> , the matzo ball soup you could hit someone with . . would not recommend this
0 a group of us went , will never go back , the service was awful and the owner did not care at all . will not go back .
4 great food and staff , especially the ham and real french cheese , love it and the atmosphere .
2 maybe it 's not fair to compare other irish bars to <unk> 's in the bay area , but this one just seemed to fall a bit short . the irish coffee was good , but not amazing . some of the booths looked <unk> authentic while other tables were
3 <unk> bar . it 's dark and cozy inside - perfect for <unk> away a <unk> night with friends . happy hour specials are great . i had the $ 3 beer of the day - not just your typical domestic or import brew either . it was the ska
2 the `` bangers '' are very good at what they do . unfortunately , if they do n't know your song , they wo n't play it ... even if you tip . boo .
3 i had the pleasure of trying market bistro last week with the fabulous gabi k. perhaps it was the company that drove the experience up to 4 stars for me . i had the california turkey sandwich , which included avocado . while i like avocado , i was hesitant
3 what a great improvement to this space ! the waterfront area is really adding to the number of unique dining choices with the addition of culinary dropout . given that it was opening night , i was still expecting the experience to be rough around the edges . however ,
3 breakfast club is one of my favorite weekend hangover cures . one of the reasons i like it is because they do n't have a bar , so there 's no possible way for me to order a mimosa or screwdriver . sometimes the best way to live a healthier
2 so , we thought we 'd head down to the brand new city north development today for lunch and see what all the <unk> was about , before it got crazy over the weekend . we knew that several new restaurants were part of the development , so we were

4 five stars for cornish pasty -- for being something a little different , for having tasty food and for having about a dozen choices for us vegetarians . i love that this place offers their pasties with <unk> -lrb- fake chicken -rrb- . i 've had both the veggie rosemary
4 i ca n't believe more people do n't know about vincitorio 's -- it 's easily the best italian restaurant in the valley . the great food , combined with a cool atmosphere -lrb- a lot of people are regulars who the bartenders and owners know by name -rrb- earns
3 so i can only review one item at qdoba , because there 's only one item i 've eaten there since my freshman year of college in madison ... vegetarian nachos . i love them . which is why i was so glad to find out a qdoba was opening
2 <unk> <unk> ! so the people that own stingray own this place and at least one other sushi pop joint . i actually liked it better than stingray but its ' just another trendy sushi spot , however the happy hour special from 4-7 m-f is pretty legit . damn
3 walked in was seated right away . ordered 3 eggs over easy , bacon , hash <unk> and toast . the food came out fast and hot and everything was cooked perfect . the price was average at around $ 9.00 . this place has solid food and i enjoy
3 no brainer here . if you like poker then this is your place . they have a great card room with daily tournaments that stat at 11:15 . they have good cheap food as well and they are very accommodating here . this place is newly renovated and super nice
2 went here 3 days ago . i normally get the chicken and hummus with the flat bread . however , this time i thought i 'd switch it up and get the fish sandwich . huge mistake ! i 'd give the sandwich 0 stars . honestly i 'd rather
3 boom susan !!! this place is solid . ordered up 2 poached eggs extra crispy bacon , hash browns and toast . everything was cooked perfect and the service was on point . only complaint is that it 's a little pricey but then again you get what you pay
4 i do n't give 5 stars often but for those of you who see my check-in 's via yelp , you know this place is my coffee go-to ! 5 reasons you should get your coffee on at cartel : 1 - its local . support your local business and
2 yikes . i completely forgot about the fact that my boyfriend found a big black hair in the food close to when we were almost finished eating . how could i have forgotten that ?? as delicious as the food was , that can never happen when you are running
4 i give this place a five star for a few reasons ... 1 - i really dig the roosevelt area . was n't crowded at all on a sunday afternoon and the surrounding buildings and palm trees make for a great leisurely walk with your coffee . 2 - the
3 went there for breakfast this sunday and the experience was great . arrived close to 10 am , there was no wait and we got a table out on the patio . it was perfect weather for brunch outside . i 'd say the only thing that put a damper
3 i have only been here once and it was for a quick drink before heading to a movie but this place is my kind of hang . if you are a laid back bar who supports local artists , has a huge selection of <unk> and plays music that makes
1 i went with such high hopes , too . i had the red curry beef . well , the beef was very strange in texture and oddly shaped . i hope it was beef . my friend had some kind of stir fried shrimp , green bean , and <unk>
3 it is just like the other location , but i like the patio a little better . it 's bigger and more open . the food and wine are great - just like the other location . i am going to spend a lot of quality time here .
4 how the hell can this place be sitting on top of a pei wei and a starbucks ? it 's a hip , urban lounge . spacious , lots of comfy seating including a wall <unk> couch seat <unk> . kind of a modern take on a 70 's era
4 i hate this place , but since they have the only roller coaster in the state ... -lrb- fail ! -rrb- - they get 5 stars , because folks ... this is as good as it gets . here , at least . it 's an amusement park , sort
1 the service was not awesome . my falafel was mediocre . the pita was kind of cold . there was way too much lettuce on it , and the lettuce was also sliced way too big to be practical . my friend had a veggie burger with cheese , they
3 forget the <unk> `` best in the country '' bs hype . you know were i 'm talking about . this is as close as you can get to real pizza <unk> . all they are missing is the red <unk> tablecloths . red devil could be in <unk> nj
3 so ... this is the only reason to go to <unk> , i mean christown . what a shithole ghetto ass excuse for a mall , it 's even more ghetto than metro center . on the other hand , costco <unk> . their ` store brand ' of kirkland

4 great food ! great service ! price - not for the <unk> , but reasonable . the previous reviews give you an idea of the ambience of avanti . i 'll just add that the noir ambience is dominated by low-key lighting ... and deep shadows , creating feelings of
2 food 's good , but i 've always considered vincent 's over-rated & over-priced . there are too many excellent restaurants for me to consider it . if i want that kinda deal , i 'll go to <unk> 's .

3 we stopped here for happy hour after some shopping on a friday , and had a really good experience . maria maria is a large , open place with beautiful decor . upon sitting down we received the chips and 3 salsa , which i really liked despite the chips
4 yum ! yum ! yum ! friends introduced us to this place - they 're regulars and we may be too . it 's a hidden place , but once you find it you are welcomed into a gorgeous restaurant with plenty of space . they have a good sized

2 good food . lots of outdoor seating .
3 great atmosphere -- very retro modern , clean , bright , airy . and the -lrb- smallish -rrb- coffee cake is outstanding , flavorful without <unk> it , though at $ 3 seems a bit overpriced . coffee is very good -- not the best i 've had , but
4 everybody raves about the carne asada and pastor , but we go for the bean and cheese burritos -lrb- no lard ! -rrb- , vegetarian quesadilla , and -lrb- for me -rrb- corn on the cob . my kids are especially crazy about the bean and cheese burritos , and
0 came here on my birthday and was not impressed . the atmosphere was nice but my husband and i were not happy with the food at all . the bread they gave pre-meal was just ok but did n't seem very fresh . there were two types of butter that
2 was at the duce last night partying with a group of people from my husbands work -lrb- it was a surprise party for the owners birthday -rrb- . although my husband and i had a really good time , i think it was mostly because of the entertainment which my
3 so far , i have tried all three of joe 's restaurants : joe 's real bbq , joe 's farm grill , and liberty market . i love them all but i think this is probably my favorite . i order the same meal here every time i go
3 tried smashburger for the first time a few weeks ago . i have to say that i really enjoyed it . i ordered the arizona burger -lrb- chipotle mayo , habenero cheese , jalapenos , guac , lettuce , tomato -rrb- and sweet potato fries . the burger was spicy
4 came here with the bachelorette party for some appetizers to tide us over since dinner was not till 7:30 . managed to come right as happy hour was beginning -lrb- 3pm to 7pm -rrb- . had a couple of drinks -lrb- mango margarita was amazing -rrb- , calamari , vegas
2 i do love chino , however , i am taking off a couple of stars because the last few times i have gone there , the food didnt seem very fresh but was till tasty . i love the pork fried rice -lrb- some of the best fried rice ive
4 pretty much my favorite place for breakfast in az . . i always get the # 10 omelet -lrb- bacon , potato , green onion , sour cream , and cheese -rrb- with no potato add avocado . sooooo gooooood . this is one of the few places i order
2 got to try a few cupcakes from caketini : seasonal pumpkin spice , <unk> , and salted caramel with vanilla . the cupcakes are massive compared to sprinkles and top it cupcakes . all of them were pretty good but my favorite was the pumpkin spice which is odd considering
4 my new favorite sammich spot !!! the bread is fresh and great !!! i always get the turkey tom with extra mayo -lrb- make sure you get extra mayo or you will have a dry sub on your hands -rrb- . the hub loves the gargantuan . the only other
0 terrible service from scott h , super slow for food and drink orders . try the bar next time .
1 impromptu stop for a late lunch - sat outside on the patio with the busy scottsdale road traffic and pedestrians to watch . it 's a good thing we had some entertainment because the food was a little slow considering there were only a few people there . i had
3 great little fun place with awesome atmosphere , great coffee , <unk> , and other real good things !
3 cool place ! tvs everywhere ! music ! game room ! and ribs that fall apart in your mouth from being so moist and tasteful !
4 2nd time there in a week . very good customer service . pro 's : the salad and bread that are served with the meals is a # 1 . the salad is filled with good stuff -lrb- that costs money ... not cheap -rrb- ... and the bread ,
1 2 stars because the burgers are average -lrb- would be 3 stars -rrb- but the price for what you get is high -lrb- minus <unk> -rrb- . with that said , i probably should go back just to see . but first impressions are usually what stick .
4 i did n't think i really liked pizza , but since i 've done reviews of around 10 pizza places , apparently i do . this one -lrb- and its branches at other locations -rrb- is the best in the valley ; maybe the best one i 've ever visited
4 count on charleston 's for top-notch food , service , and ambience . i have visited this location at least a half dozen times , so i can attest to their consistency . my favorite dish is the honey lime chicken salad , which is light and tasty . it
4 these cakes are amazing ! they taste wonderful . i 've been able to sample them on two different occasions , and they 're just delicious . who would have thought something as basic as a bundt cake could be so great ? they have a great cream cheese frosting
2 went here to eat last night . my friend loves this place for their beer and really enjoys rocking happy hour . i myself do n't drink so i ca n't comment on the quality of their beer . we came in after happy hour , so the restaurant was
1 i popped into this spot with a small group of people for their `` after dinner hours '' bar set-up . the interior is very chic and they open up the side doors so that you can enjoy the amazing weather both from the inside or the outdoor patio .
4 this is where the beautiful people converge on a friday night to eat some amazing food and drink wine . i am continually entertained by the people that frequent this establishment . i have sampled salad and pizza and have yet to be disappointed ! the service is friendly and
2 i was with my coworker on a business appt in this area today and he suggested we eat lunch here . i was a little hesitant because the places he has mentioned in the past as being his usual haunts usually do n't agree with me but i was actually
3 i go to gb for the balcony and the <unk> . one a warm sunny day there are n't many places i would rather relax . watching the people on mill ave as well as the planes flying into phx can kill a few hours if you are bored .
4 best , and biggest candy store in az . . what else do you need to know !? they have almost everything you can imagine . went today & got some <unk> jelly beans for the candy dish at the office . never grow old my friends !! visit sweeties
0 easily the worst establishment in downtown phoenix . hands down . i ca n't express how badly i wish i could give 0 stars to this place . <unk> from the second we showed up to the last . i want nothing to do with the employees or the clientele
4 the best bar food in phoenix . actually , calling it `` bar food '' almost seems <unk> , this is just very tasty cuisine . hot chick sandwich , best turkey , mahi-mahi sandwich , nachos , soup - all are excellent . i did not review this place
4 after a year of debating whether to make the drive downtown for this place , i am happy to say that i finally did . i 'm sorry it was n't sooner . when you approach the entrance , you get a good feeling , unlike the rest of the
3 great happy hour and definitely my go-to spot for appetizers and margaritas . a friend recommended this place for happy hour food , but i came with low expectations , as i do with every place in phoenix . i was pleasantly surprised how good everything was for a chain
4 i visited the desert botanical gardens on valentine 's day to see the chihuly blown glass exhibit . one word to describe it : incredible ! the pieces are mixed throughout the desert displays which had our group constantly questioning whether any of the pieces were possibly custom made for
3 it was st. patrick 's day , and i was looking for a <unk> bar or restaurant , one that would n't be packed with the drunk <unk> . i know , i know , i 'm a total party <unk> ... hey , i 'm not arguing with you
3 when zoe 's kitchen was featured on groupon , i decided to buy one and check the place out . i had the tuna sandwich -lrb- with red onions -rrb- and the potato salad . my boyfriend had the chicken marinara plate , but i ca n't remember the side
4 since my initial review , i 've been back to cafe zuzu many times . this is definitely one of my favorite places to go . i recently discovered their potato gnocchi . holy cow , this stuff is amazing !! i 'm not a mushroom fan , so i
4 after a late night at work on saturday , a late sunday brunch at the farm sounded amazing ! we pulled in around 10:00 , and were warned by someone at the front that the wait for breakfast was at least 45 minutes , but there was n't wait for
4 if you think you 've arrived at a warehouse and might get mugged in the parking lot , you know you 're about to have an amazing meal . the food is authentic , the flavors are delicious ... everything i 've tried is fresh and tasty . eggplant ,
4 best bookstore in town , for all of the reasons everyone has written below . i miss the old location on mill ... but the new location is near lots of other cool stuff . and i love the gifts section ... can always find something neat and eclectic for
2 i 've been here a couple of times and can report : i like it ! it 's a fairly unpretentious place with good beer and a friendly staff . i 've enjoyed the <unk> beer and double ipa . they regularly invite local food trucks to plant themselves out
3 i really like this place . let 's see what we have here : tons of vinyl records -lrb- some at $ 1.00 prices -rrb- ? check . a collection of obscure <unk> rock vinyl ? check . old dudes talking vinyl <unk> ? check . weird older guy <unk>
1 i have always really liked this little dark and dingy hole in the wall for the beer only . their food is not good . there isnt anything good on the menu other than beer dont even bother with it cuz over the years my husband and i have tried
4 this is my favorite place in the valley . there is nothing that can compare to the beauty of a walk along the water here . i love to be on the north side which is the side that people rarely go to . they are missing out because its
2 tiny drinks big prices not sure about this place yet . location was really good otherwise . not worth the extra money for location . review update several days later i loved the interior but who wants to stay inside when you are on mill . it 's much more
3 i ate at this place a few times a few years ago , and this dish <unk> memorable : <unk> con chile rojo ~ just like nana used to make ... two pork chops grilled then <unk> in a spicy red chile sauce . served with rice , whole beans
3 went with a party of 8 on sunday <unk> . -lrb- we had been going to <unk> <unk> 's actually , but it was closed for renovations , so we went next door to dos gringos . -rrb- the place is really nicely decorated and `` fun '' from a
3 have to give this place some serious love . went with my <unk> son and enjoyed the place a lot . ground beef tacos - totally scrumptious . best thing we had . they do hard tacos right . pernil pork tacos - very tasty also . tender meat some
4 i must add my 5-star recommendation to this marvelous little establishment . and it is little - 5 or 6 tables . as others have said , the `` free sample '' is very tasty . and the people running the place are genuinely nice people . i had the
1 not great . barely good . tri-tip sandwich had `` tough '' tri-tip and it fell apart with the effort of trying to tear the meat during a bite . kids did n't like their burgers as well as they like in-n-out . the fries were decent , but the
3 went based on a yelp search . asked for the `` yelp deal '' and the girl gave me a `` what is that ? '' i then had to explain the offer . minus half a star . employees should know the offers , right ? not too high
4 just a quick update on something i tried on my most recent visit : the sauce served with the sweet potato fries is the best <unk> sauce i 've ever tasted . i 'd go back just for that side dish , except everything else is good also .
4 do you want an escape from your typical arizona dining experience ? do you crave an outdoor seating area were the beer flows like water and the old men dance around in traditional german clothing holding <unk> ? you really need to check this place out . i live about
2 <unk> i really wanted to love this place ! good morning veterans day , yahoo day off for teachers ! my boyfriend suggested we get breakfast to celebrate not having to wake up at 5am . he suggested some of our usual favorites -lrb- kiss the cook , black bear
4 best place to go when you are feeling blue ! as a fresh new transplant to the area who knows absolutely no one besides her beyond retired neighbor who hits the pillow by 4pm , i often find myself slightly <unk> . instead of watching another episode of <unk> ,
4 mojo is fantastic ! after dining at cafe boa in tempe we were <unk> back to our car 's and were drawn to the unique set up of mojo . we walked in and then found ourselves with mini buckets of frozen yogurt goodness . what i love about these
3 i almost feel bad not giving 5 stars because it really was 5 star service , however , i feel 5 stars are reserved for the best of the best . -lrb- little things like valet already having your car pulled around on your way out -rrb- anyway , enough
4 yum , yum yum - i finally had a sandwich from here and my coworkers were jealous . which in all fairness i probably did on purpose . i got the market special and friday a great day . bread is round and thin and charred , and i swear
3 this place is incredible ! just about every kind of liquor you can imagine ! i love the writing along the walls as well , makes it less of a warehouse . if you are as big a wine drinker as i am than you are bound to find something
3 its good do n't get me wrong . i 've heard there is a soup to die for but i have yet to enjoy that . the sushi is great but the sushi for what it is i think is highly overpriced . 2 rolls for me for $ 30
2 the main reason i am giving 3 stars tonight was the service ! not all together but our waitress as a whole was awful ! she never came to our table during our dinner . we had to flag her down for a box and asked for the check right
3 this is such a fun relaxed place to eat !! i always sit at the bar because i totally enjoy watching them prepare everything . maybe my review wo n't be the best for most people checking this place out ... but i have never actually had a pasty but
4 best bagels in arizona !! they blueberry bagels with blueberry creme cheese is amazing !! they are fresh daily , never hard or lacking flavor . they owners are amazing and the people definitely are friendly and remember me no matter how often or little i am in there .
2 i 've been to windsor enough now to `` get it '' and to have let them address some of the observations of other customers . i 'll start off by saying that there is nothing <unk> <unk> in the place , and the concept is quite good . combined
3 had my first visit there this afternoon . very good broth in that pho . i had a large bowl of the number one `` everything '' version -lrb- complete with tripe -rrb- . the meat had been cooked long enough to be tender . the spring rolls were good
1 i 'm really trying to just grin and bear it as i <unk> <unk> that the equipment is n't being refreshed and the locker <unk> just are n't getting cleaned . i 'm on the verge of giving up . going there -- no matter how convenient -- is becoming
3 i 'll post a review of my one happy hour experience there . i intend to go back for more . again and again . the happy hour runs from 3 to 6 , and it was suggested -- no -- <unk> <unk> to me by other regulars that i
3 first of all , there is nothing wrong with this place . it 's a <unk> coffee shop that offers all the popular items at good prices . go there and enjoy . visit in <unk> with a trip to the art museum , phoenix little theatre or the main
2 the lighting . it 's the lighting . whomever did the lighting design for lucky strike deserves an award . the lighting makes the place , even more than the furniture and colors . you walk into this subdued <unk> space , totally devoid -lrb- it seems -rrb- of any
2 based on food by itself , i would have only given a two . i do n't think crepes -lrb- and i am by no means an expert crepe eater -rrb- should be tough . i do n't think they should need to be <unk> through with a <unk> knife
3 on the plus side , they : a -rrb- serve wine and beer , b -rrb- give you a place and an atmosphere to sit and talk about the movie before and after in the lounge area external to the auditorium c -rrb- give us film buffs a place to
3 an <unk> of my youth whose best times are probably behind it , sadly . i 've been there so many times for special occasions . it 's always seemed like the real core of the valley to me . the grounds and main halls are still beautiful and are
3 there are n't many places around the valley that can pull me from a distance like a <unk> of <unk> metal in the <unk> of an <unk> , but this is one of them . it 's mainly the atmosphere on the open patio , i think . or maybe
3 good bet for happy hour in the biltmore . nice menu featuring a fairly impressive margarita -lrb- even though that 's not my usual drink -rrb- . there are good prices on the food items as well , though the $ 5 chicken skewers tasted a bit <unk> , at
3 go for the happy hour , enjoy the drink specials -lrb- $ 5 martinis among others . yay ! -rrb- and order the big ass burger , but before you do remember these points : it 's open seating during happy hour -lrb- which runs 4-7 -rrb- . there were
4 my wife had never gone here until i took her . me having lived in florida and louisiana i love this kinda home cooking that you do n't get really anywhere else here in the valley . i love the chicken and dumplings ! they are the best . my
4 this is the best cajun resturant in arizona . i 've lived in louisiana before and this is as close as it gets for az . . i had the crawfish <unk> and its was awesome and the most authentic i 've had since living in louisiana . my wife
3 my wife and i visited lgo a while back and we were both impressed and enjoyed our meal . the wings were by far the best i have ever tasted . our pizza was great , we had the pepperoni and ricotta . it does get kinda crowded and chaotic
3 i love the clubhouse . its not super tiny like some smaller venues and they tend to book bands that i want to see . the stage is not high and and there is no barrier separating you from the band which is always best . the parking is convenient
4 i love the drive in movies . its such a classic experience for such a cheap price and you get more for your money . i have not gone to the snack bar or the bathrooms so i do n't know that goes . but if you are halfway smart
3 had a nice easter brunch here today . we 've ate brunch before here , so we knew it would be good . plus it was a good choice , as it may have ended up being less than some of the easter brunches at the resorts in town .
4 i 'm definitely a fan of nordstrom 's ... just left their anniversary sale a happy girl ! i scored some great sales , and remembered several people i needed to get gifts for ... and with my nordstrom 's card i got double points . -lrb- so that 's
4 i love this place ! man , the chicken machaca burrito i had for lunch today was <unk> !! omg so good ... and super filling . we go here all the time , especially on the weekends . their breakfast burrito is amazing . i really like the decor
2 it 's just too much friggin ' work to eat here . i just ca n't enjoy waiting for 3 hours to get in anywhere . you wind up at the bar next door drinking out of an <unk> to do something . but that 's no good , because
4 today is a sad day . my partner and i went to maui dog for the always good dogs and fries . they were already closed . this was one of my top 5 meals in phoenix . consistently excellent . we will miss you very much . i hope
4 we only ended up here because maizie 's down the street closes early on sundays , but i was very glad we did ! the restaurant is in the clarendon hotel , which has been made into a hip little boutique hotel with an awesome pool and roof deck .
4 i was in phoenix last weekend visiting the fam , which meant we were definitely out and about on the brunch scene . i 've had vovomeena bookmarked for a couple months or so , and my sister , who lives nearby , assured everyone it was a solid choice
3 oregano 's is adorable . when the weather is nice there is nearly nothing better than sitting outside on the little patio with a glass of wine and a pie while sinatra and martin <unk> you into a drunken bliss . while the menu is n't necessarily <unk> , it
3 i am excited about ncounter . for a long time harlow 's has been the only great breakfast joint near me -lrb- mill avenue area -rrb- , and though i would be happy to eat there every one of my days off , kristen does n't like it much ,
3 my soon to be wife and i had our first date here , i won her over with pizza and had her take a slice of cheesecake home for her mom , that 's how you do it boys . while this location is n't quite as `` jazzy ''
4 consistently incredible service and flawless steaks award fleming 's steakhouse five big ones . i 've been to steakhouses all over the country and this place holds it 's own with the best of them while not being <unk> expensive . it 's not cheap by any means , and
4 i was completely skeptical about phoenix ranch market when my wife said we were going to go check it out last week , so skeptical that i told her i did n't want to go , in all honesty ... what could possibly be so good about a little grocery
4 when kevin and i first began dating , about 4 years ago , i did some research to find an interesting place to take him on a date . i somehow stumbled upon this place and so i swept him away on a surprise adventure . admission was only $
4 take all of the stars ! i will do my best not to gush , but know as you 're reading this that i 'd gladly gush if i thought it was appropriate . to have posh listed as a restaurant is almost a travesty ... posh is an evening
3 one of my top three favorite theaters in the phoenix area for sure , i have found more gems at camelview than any other theater . camelview and valley art in tempe are really the only theaters i <unk> on a weekly basis so i do n't miss something wonderful
3 dang i love tempe marketplace . they have it all , a huge plethora of stores to choose from for your every need . the place is kept clean , they always have visible security and there are n't ever a bunch of homeless kids running around being ab <unk>
3 the hotel valley ho is a pretty sweet place to stay with a good location in scottsdale , i 've been here a few times and really like it , but it is not without a couple of quirks . my second time here they tried to tell me they
3 pizza muffins ! if you go here , order a dozen . they 're <unk> of ham , sausage and cheesy goodness ! you wont be disappointed . trust !
3 ca n't believe i have not reviewed this place . <unk> is a popular lunch place at my work . it is legendary and well known in the neighborhood . my usual here is the philly cheese steak w onions . . it 's sooo good and pretty damn legit
4 glad to have a wildflower location open up by my work . it 's a good alternative to paradise bakery . the two have pretty similar concept . they just opened up here about a month ago and i have probably grabbed lunch here <unk> times already . my favorites
3 good dumplings , they 're huge ! it 's a meal in itself . stir fry noodles are great . i like the seafood better than the xo beef . didnt really taste any xo sauce , seems like they just added a bit of chili oil and some whole
2 i 've been here more times than i can count . its a great spot to meet up with friends for bar food and beer without spending a lot . wings are good here . i like their golden sauce . it 's on special most nights for $ 5
4 when i first came to phx , i was brought to the ranch market at the chinese cultural center and was told it was the largest asian market in the area ... and i wanted to cry ! so , when i moved to chandler and found lee lees ,
2 mekong is the other large asian grocery store in the east valley . personally i like lee lee 's better because 1 -rrb- it 's closer to home and 2 -rrb- prices are lower it is a bit cleaner than lee lee 's , but possibly because it 's newer
4 my initial thoughts of this place was of a dirty hole in the wall restaurant . when i finally stopped by i found out it was n't so bad . i heard and driven by this place many times but never really had a hankering to stop in and try
2 i bought a groupon here a few months ago and finally made the trip here to use it . i have been reading about this place for a while so i was excited to finally try it . the bf ordered a philly cheesesteak and i had the half sandwich
3 i had been patiently waiting for this place to open ! i was super excited when they did , however a little underwhelmed by some of the reviews . maybe i had hyped it up in my head too much ? but i decided to give it a go anyway
2 i 've been here more times than i can count , and its almost never my idea to go . i like this place a lot more when its on a dead night . fridays & saturdays there are just way too many people . i usually order whatever 's
3 i ca n't say i 've been here too many times , mostly because i do n't eat meat . but my boyfriend had never been here before and to my surprise , they did have veggie hot dogs ! went here on a wednesday night before dance class -lrb-
3 i feel a strong sense of <unk> <unk> since i swear i 've reviewed hanny 's before . alas , i have not . i 've been here several times since last year . i love the design of this department store turned restaurant . and the basement ! the
4 came here during restaurant week and was a happy girl from start to finish . at first i was a little disappointed that there was no steak on the restaurant week menu , but that soon passed . our server was on point for our entire visit , drinks were
4 i went today for lunch with my husband and really enjoyed everything !! what we had : fried chicken - this was the best i have ever had . . it was juicy and flavorful and the skin crispy and delicious fired catfish : the best !! wonderful flavor and
4 went here for a company party and was very impressed with the food and the service . my absolute favorite thing i ate was the lamb chops . they were amazing , they had so much flavor and were cooked perfectly . the filet is up there with the best
4 i thoroughly enjoyed the eggs benedict <unk> sausage ... excellent !! my son had the carnitas tacos and thought it was best thing he 's tasted in a while ... we actually received the tacos for free because a server dropped some sauce on my son on accident ... i
3 great place , especially for happy hour -lrb- 3-7 m-f -rrb- and they have a late night happy hour that starts at 10pm , i think . they have beer specials , martinis are $ 5.95 and almost every appetizer is half off . i have never had a bad
3 i am totally in love with their fresh brewed mango iced tea , it is really good . their food is more on the healthy side and offers some choices that are not on most breakfast/lunch spots . i have tried their eggs benedict with turkey & avocado and it
2 yay another cute place with shitty parking ! been here a few times to grab coffee and something to eat before work , had the jerk chicken pre-made sandwich which was <unk> they do n't skimp you on the chicken , nice and hefty i could only eat half the
3 me gusto el pollo supremo . it 's always a sophie 's choice between the chicken and the beef ... each are equally tasty but i must say that my carnivorous soul favors the beef . unless my soul is feeling especially <unk> and i order both . both meats
3 i probably would n't come here nearly as much if i did n't live right down the street . in all honesty , the food is pretty mediocre . however , i 've found a solution that works pretty well for me : get really drunk , then eat .
2 cool place , good chocolate <unk> , very friendly staff and <unk> support local artist and musicians , which is very cool . one gripe : a certain barista sucks at making lattes . both times it felt like the cup was half empty . take it easy on the
3 mmmm delux . i wake up and call for it in the night . i have magnificent dreams about those little grocery carts filled with mixed fries with endless sides of ketchup and that delicious pink sauce . delux burger , classic burger , fish sandwich ... always superb .
2 the hot dog was good but , really ? what 's all the <unk> ? i was still hungry when i finished it so that 's not a good sign right there . i ordered a chili dog with mustard , ketchup and cheese and onion rings . the onion
3 i moved to az from the south , and there is no sweet tea in the desert ... except at zoe 's kitchen . their sweet tea is very close to what you get back east ! i like the healthy fare here , and the yelp deal of 10
3 ah , firehouse ... i forgot how good you were . i 'd not visited you since i lived in charlotte . this location is on indian school near the sprout 's -- i stopped here for take-out one night after grocery shopping when i did n't want to cook
3 yes , bread but -- the turkey waldorf salad , please !! it was so fabulous that i shopped for the ingredients and made it at home myself . it is one big bowl of deliciousness . i ca n't speak to the bread , other than what comes with
4 i feel like i 'm on some sort of adventure whenever i visit lee lee 's . upon entering , you 're hit with some sort of <unk> aroma that is super off-putting . that smell . just barrel through . your sense of smell will adjust as time passes
4 this place is definitely worth the long trek out to gilbert . it 's some sort of retro farm house planted in the midst of beautiful scenery ... you wo n't miss it . ahi tuna burger is heavenly . juicy seared ahi tuna served on a bun w /
2 i give this place 3 stars b/c i think there 's room for improvement , and there 's no doubt that the owner , dana who came by our table and <unk> asked for <unk> feedback will take our gentle <unk> to heart . our waitress was also very kind
3 i loved everything about this place . i would have loved to have more of a selection on the food at the time that we went -lrb- they do n't serve salads after 3pm -rrb- , but overall the wine , service , and the food that we did order
3 since it 's already a <unk> point that this place has delicious food at an excellent value , i 'll simply provide a few <unk> remarks : great original paintings sweet & fresh faced <unk> transplant at counter amazing strawberry salsa -lrb- wtf -- who knew ? -rrb- new favorite
4 jobing.com is by far the best arena in this state . there , i said it . the experience is not even close to the other arenas . we do not have many , but it far exceeds anything we 've built based on basic purpose . this place has
3 so ... this place is great . i take our <unk> as well as my parents 4 year old <unk> <unk> from time to time and try to go to the park at least 4 + times a month . although we know we should take him more , we
3 i like trying new things . its fun and hip . while killing some time before doing side work on a sunday , i did a yelp search and * <unk> * fate brewing popped up . lets review : ~ fud/drink ~ the food here is pretty urban and
4 loyalty ... it means a lot . i am loyal to <unk> harkins ! many forget that harkins was started here in arizona and for many years fought hard against the competitors to make it to where they are at . this cine capri location might be the nicest one
1 <unk> has never really been considered a nice bar ... i do not know many people who would consider this a staple . its there , if you ever need it ... ~ <unk> ~ the food is bland . lets just call it as it is . salads are
1 i do n't see what people like about this place . i give you that the food it decent , but as a native to the phoenix area , why would n't i just go to honey bears . the bbq is so much better there . this place is
2 i like what the two hippies brand is trying to do . bring a local chain of food at a great price point . the problem is , they are n't killing it on the product . if you want to have a dumpy location , with nowhere to sit
4 the only complaint that i have about america 's is that i ca n't get enough carne asada . it is wonderful . i usually stay away from the beef in mexican restaurants -lrb- especially `` taco stands '' -rrb- <unk> dog , cat , or other animals might have
0 i am so disappointed . went there early this evening for a celebratory dinner . we walk in and it smells , well , old . the atmosphere is cold and the place is kind of in <unk> . they need to just redo the interior design . our server
0 first , they do n't answer their phone . next , they are closed between lunch and dinner . finally , it is ridiculously over priced for the area and quality . $ 43 ?! i literally pay $ 24 for the exact same order at another pho spot very
2 i 've been here twice , once for a friend 's baby shower and tonight for dinner with a friend . kind of torn about this place right now . tonight we were greeted and sat right away . i really like the porch and couch was very comfy .
1 more like a 2.5 i guess ... very cute hipster ambiance . loved that . but be prepared to get cozy with total strangers . it is a very tight space . also there is very limited parking . if you have a larger car / <unk> , do n't
2 updating my review from a few months ago ... not a great experience like i 'm used to having at postinos unfortunately . on a positive note , the place was packed as usual so i was pleasently surprised to be seated fairly quickly during lunchtime . after that ,
2 wow the coffee is superb , there 's no doubt about that ! i got an iced dirty chai with rice milk -lrb- they were out of almond milk . bummer -rrb- . hubby got a cappuccino . excellent execution and flavor . but i just do n't feel comfortable
4 took my grandmother here who was visiting from back east and we had such a delightful afternoon . there was a wine tasting that was fabulous . i actually bought a bottle from nc that tasted like tobacco -lrb- sounds gross but it was excellent -rrb- . we sampled the
2 older crowd . was hella fun . been 3 years since i 've last been . good times .
2 i go to watch <unk> and fred green there . drinks are decent and cold . one of those places you ca n't believe there 's a cover charge . like <unk> said , <unk> without the risk .
3 i very much enjoyed eating here . food was great . fairly fast service . was n't expensive either for the 4 of us .
3 easy to <unk> there due to the large variety . i enjoy going there with friends . affordable for a buffet .
3 had some <unk> , pretty cool . long wait to sit and the place is so busy that any messes are swept or kicked under the table . for my wife and i to eat , it cost $ 120 including tip . cheesecake was awesome .
3 my first time to rigatony 's and i 'm a fan . great service , good food -lrb- chicken parmesan with spaghetti with marinara -rrb- , and decent price .
2 i really like nypd food and service . do n't sit on the patio though , they forget about you out there . i was disgusted and left from the lack of service out there . i did eventually come back because i like their food .
2 meh , it 's just a burger and soggy fries . what 's the big attraction ? menu reminds me of in-and-out .
3 i went with my co-workers today and i had a chicken taco salad . the service was fast enough for the place being full , the price was average , there was plenty of parking , and i had a great experience . i 'd go again .
3 my friends and i love going here for lunch . not sure why , but it ` feels ' healthy . not sure if it is or not , but i 'm very stuffed when i leave . the bell pepper hummus is awesome .
3 went there with my boss , we met some co-workers there . i had the combo on onion , it was great . service was fast . price was average . i 'd go again .
1 okay , the food , if not able to feed entire <unk> , is on the delicious side , but unimaginative . they give fancy names to tired dishes , and the menu is as big as the portions . the service : did they purchase their waiters from a
4 i love butcher shops and my dog . i am a vegetarian . allow me to explain . first , butcher shops are becoming <unk> because of grocery store meats . 5 in phoenix ? bullshit ! this is awful . if you eat meat , find yourself a butcher
3 oh this place is wonderful . i feel this way because i am an awful cook but i love eating at home . that said , i am notorious for bringing food home and dishing it out on plates and having a go at it like that . well ,
0 this is probably the most awful aj 's ever , strictly because of the awful <unk> manager and staff . they 're the least genuine counter staff ever . i get being <unk> about things , that never really bothers me . but the attitude , oh god the attitude
1 i was really excited about moto , so my mom and i checked it out . bleh . the sushi was just not good ... not like <unk> , but mediocre . our server was pretty young and confused about the whole serving profession . i give it two stars
1 okay , first , the service here is totally shitty . -5 stars , duh . the burgers are yum . <unk> stars the beer selection ? omg <unk> s & m bbq lol . awesome . <unk> stars
0 does it shock you that this place blows ? does it really ? ok , let me back up , as i 'm assuming that every reader is as horrified with pop culture and the way our world <unk> youth . i for one am simply <unk> for vomiting when
0 arizona mills is what happens when mesa and peoria * have babies . that 's all i 'll say , as it 's all been said already . * <unk> and <unk> , i 'm sorry , but some of your <unk> has driven me to <unk> . if you
3 finally !! a gluten-free pizza crust worth eating ! the husband and i usually have to order 2 separate pizzas , because i refuse to eat most gluten-free crusts ... they are usually crumbly with little resemblance to a `` real '' crust . but , at picazzo 's ,
2 not bad . prices are fairly <unk> ... especially for detail work , or more than one vehicle -lrb- the husband and i went at the same time -rrb- . they did a pretty good job cleaning up the interior of my <unk> car . thank goodness ... i thought
3 an adorable spot , with retro candy and an old-fashioned -lrb- yet updated -rrb- vibe . this is my go-to spot after a meal at federal , postino , or windsor . good planning putting all of those places in close proximity to tasty ice cream ! milkshakes are delicious
2 i was happily surprised when i saw the paradise valley burger company 's listing on yelp . since our recent return to the valley , i 've been hunting for restaurants that have opened in the year we 've been away . a new -lrb- ish -rrb- burger place ,
1 portions are ridiculously huge and prices are cheap - win win ! we shared a chicken fried steak breakfast which was pretty darn tasty . i was n't very impressed with the pancakes or biscuits , although i certainly ate them anyways . the steak was tasty , however and
3 great , authentic , delicious indian food . we are always excited to make the trip over here , knowing we 'll get some real indian food . the samosas , garlic naan , biryani , and lamb korma are among my favorites , and should always be had with
1 we took our 4-year-old to a birthday party at crackerjax this past weekend . the arcade was full of fun games ... but too bad many of them ate our tokens , played for only a few seconds before shutting off , or lacked necessary parts . the two basketball
4 urban cookies - i love you . ollie cakes - i really love you ! i am a girl with a massive <unk> . there is nothing better sounding to me that a shop that sells nothing other than cookies and cupcakes -lrb- well , and drinks , of course
1 the two star rating says this `` meh . i 've experienced better . '' and that 's exactly how i would describe olive and ivy . i 've been here two times now and each time left thinking `` nothing special '' `` over priced '' . first time
3 i really enjoy chloe 's corner . the setup and atmosphere are great , very warm and inviting and the staff have all been very friendly . on to the food . i have ordered the chicken pesto sandwich and the hot roast beef and both were delicious . the
3 i do enjoy hamburger works - every once in a while , i just have to have one of their burgers . the basic cheeseburger and fries special # 1 is all it takes to make me a happy boy , if a bit bloated . the same can not
3 super fun place to hang out and have dinner , i 've always liked the food . definitely get the egg on your burger . definitely .
4 watch out , america 's taco shop ! this place is a real competitor for america 's . i think that there is a chance that their food might actually be better . i 'll have to go a few more times to see . certainly the service is wonderful
3 despite my penchant for $ 1000 handbags , i am a cheap bastard . i endure the chaos , misery , and <unk> of humanity <unk> samples like pigs at the <unk> that <unk> costco for cheap gas , paper towels , toilet paper , kirkland <unk> , <unk> ,
4 a rare and precious combination can be found at lux : <unk> coffee and homemade fresh bakery , ambiance , good people-watching , and friendly staff who are n't too cool to smile and act normally . love !
3 ok ... it 's a chain . it 's also one of the very few places where my dad , boyfriend , and i can go and everyone can get a meal that they genuinely like . it 's a little pricey and their dessert menu leaves a lot to
2 okay , so , yes : the decor is divine , original and edgy without being overly trendy or plastic . i sincerely wish my home looked like this . the bathroom sinks ? genius . cool as hell . that 's kind of where my infatuation with st. francis
3 <unk> and pricey ... def not a place i would go to on my own , but went for a work event . as the token vegetarian , i was a little nervous , but the roasted veggie plate was , admittedly , amazing . amazing . the <unk> soup
3 az88 defies <unk> . location ? total suck . tucked away behind an obnoxious parking garage in the middle of * <unk> * old town scottsdale . completely and totally inconvenient for phoenicians who do n't want to drive half an hour home <unk> . i know , i 'm
3 so , a meal at the macayo 's in north scottsdale , for whatever reason , always was a <unk> ticket to <unk> in my experience . maybe the employees were angry and washing their dirty hands in the salsa buckets . do n't know , do n't care .
2 the sanctuary is stunning . i mean stunning . the decor and architecture are <unk> . my so and i spent a night here last summer to celebrate my finishing my mba . we imagined a day and night of <unk> in the sun in the ginormous spectacular pool ,
0 this sorry shithole really could only survive in <unk> adjacent to the resort . good god ! i actually felt like my wallet got <unk> for the experience : one dinner + one quesadilla appetizer + three margaritas = $ 60 . what in the hell is that !? it
2 because my otherwise perfect and adorable so has a weakness for any and all food topped with a <unk> runny egg , i have been dragged against my will to hp more than a few times . yes , a runny egg and prosciutto `` breakfast '' pizza . this
3 this place had great pizzas , and great ambiance . the wine , beer and drink selections were very good . the service was so-so , our waitress was a bit rude , but other than that , i really enjoyed my meal !
4 this is one of my favorite places to go for some post-work drinks . the sangria is delicious - not to sweet , which is a really common with sangria around these parts . the portions are small , but it 's a tapas place , so what do you
3 i debated between three and four stars because although i did not really like my meal , everyone else i was with seemed to enjoy theirs . st francis has a really neat atmosphere , with <unk> , indoor/outdoor seating . the service was good , but the food just
0 well to start off there was not much i could eat considering most of the food had trans fat . the ice cream they serve has <unk> and <unk> -lrb- trans fat -rrb- they use grocery brand buns with high fructose corn syrup and partially hydrogenated oil -lrb- also trans
0 this is the ultimate bro bar and restaurant . it is cramped and packed with bro 's and <unk> . the food tastes like poop and usually get <unk> followed by toilet time when eating here . the food is over priced and the <unk> is horrible . i like
2 i personally have no clue why the amazing reviews . for one they have 4 menus , its bizarre and <unk> . then they like got one of the menus in off white with like <unk> print and you cant even see the writing . dinner service is slow as
2 service here totally sucks . i was <unk> by the waitress of lying when i told her we had been waiting an hour for our food . how f 'd is that , she went and checked when the ticket was entered and said it was entered 15 mins ago
3 i went here the other day and forgot how fucking good and moist their rotisserie chicken is , seriously never had white meat that juicy !! the honey glazed carrots are bomb the are <unk> long ways , i thought it would be like baby carrot <unk> but no ,
2 ok here is the thing , the seats here are soo uncomfortable ! . they curve like he letter c and your neck is <unk> down <unk> why would they make a seat like that . i will say the sound is <unk> to harkins but the ticket is also
2 i give it a 3 because the cages or whatever you call them are pretty small . there isnt much to see . this place definatly needs a make over . however i do always have a good time , the staff seems to really enjoy what they do .
4 <unk> , how excited am i for this place to open less than a mile from my work ????? they have a 5 dollar lunch special every day from 11-3 . oh did i mention its bomb !! yesterday it was angus burger w sweet potato fries and a gelato
2 i was torn on how to rate this place . i guess if it is based on burgers alone it would be 1 star for flavor and price for that little gross thing . if it was based on customer service 5 stars for sure , sadly it is by
4 we went in on a sunday morning and the place was packed . we did n't need to wait to long though -lrb- went over to the guitar store for a bit -rrb- . we were seated pretty promptly and ordered eggs benedict and my boyfriend got biscuits and gravy
2 this zoo is a pretty cool place to check out -lrb- just avoid the summer -rrb- . i wish more of it was indoors because it does get pretty toasty , but if you live in phoenix you have to check it out . the library does have free passes
4 this is the closest you will get to chicago style pizza in az . . i would even argue that the crust is better than some chicago place -lrb- if you like a buttery crust -rrb- . the wait is long typically , but trust me when i tell you
4 this place has the best brats i have ever had ! they are on the pricey side but trust me they are sooo worth it ! the jerky is good too and if you have a furry friend they have a large variety of dog treats and foods too !
1 i just do n't know . i liked the valet service . i do n't like not knowing where to stand and wait for the hostess to seat you because you come through a back patio door and assume it 's not the front . there are n't many tables
0 i 'd like to write a review of this place , but the thing is i have no clue how the food is . after seeing the decent ratings and the fact that my last two favorite sushi places have shut down i decided to get dressed really cute and
4 we have been coming to this location for almost a year now . not only is there a happy hour m-f 3-7 but they also have nightly specials from 8 to close . on weekends they have `` hangover specials '' from <unk> . i could go into detail for
0 a group of girls and myself booked a suite for a night this past saturday at talking stick . we planned on three sleeping there and a few more came by to get ready with us before heading out to old town to party . we all had our share
2 with so many great breakfast places in the valley , this one comes off as trying to be both modern , and fast , and does n't quite hit the spot . do n't get me wrong , there are a few standouts : ie the rosemary potatoes . but
4 i was on a mission for pour over coffee , and thanks to yelp - i found it ! i would go out on a limb and say that giant coffee might make the best , yes , i said it ... the best coffee in phoenix . i am
3 in the mood for a good hamburger we visited zinburger last week , and had the kobe burger and truffle fries . the truffle aoli offered with the truffle fries was a little much , so i tasted it in very small quantities . the kobe burger with mushrooms was
4 best . pizza . in . the . valley . period . i adore the began 's , as i 've known them prior to taking ownership of classic italian pizza . several years ago , i even had my college graduation there . over the years , <unk> has
3 solid pizza for pizza night . great concept from fox for thin crust pizzas . we order at least once a month , and can ways count on quality pizza and salads . very happy with the gluten free crust option - its a great alternative - and guilt-free way
4 1 . -rrb- 2 $ small pitchers of pbr . 2 . -rrb- real artists hang out here . 3 . -rrb- pablo luna , william fucking reed , alex , occasionally spin here . 4 . -rrb- tuesday night after midnight do n't think that everyone in the room
4 i was lucky -lrb- and grateful -rrb- to have some native arizonan 's for friends when i lived in the phoenix metro area . it is through these people that i was introduced to sakana . if you are like i was , you might be carrying an unfair bias
3 great service , even for a busy saturday . our server was a grandmother too , which was really cool . food was above average but nothing great . <unk> was good , pancakes i ca n't understand why they 're popular , and actually the southwest breakfasts were rather
2 after a couple recent visits i ca n't help but notice that mellow mushroom just is n't the place it was when it first opened . i remember enjoying full pints of <unk> christmas ale at happy hour prices as well as other `` high gravity '' options that were
3 nice , clean & more modern looking location here . food is pretty much the same as other locations , with parking being a challenge sometimes due to adjacent restaurants . buffet prices are n't bad , but the soda fee is a ripoff .
3 croissants ? where are they ? must be confusing with other <unk> . nonetheless we had a good dining experience here . pleasant , somewhat dark and <unk> feel to the place - very <unk> . not many beers to choose from though . spin dip was fairly good ,
1 horribly slow here with food , and some items were just downright foul -lrb- eggs in the breakfast burrito -rrb- . hot sauce in the plastic tube was good though , as well as the spicy tomatillo sauce . no real drive-thru . what the heck ?
2 movie themed in decor , with lots of booths , and overall is a throw back to a casual diner 40 + years ago . traditional breakfast favorites . nothing we had was bad , but nothing great either . worth trying .
0 just when it looked like a normal parking lot i drove back and found a plethora of open parking spots ... but then they all said reserved for such and such business -lrb- not oreganos -rrb- . they managed to do it again - find a location with inadequate parking
3 any place with an habanero burger served with a glass of cold milk is my sort of place . green chile macaroni and cheese is quite tasty as well . they also have a modest selection of craft beers on tap . menu is printed <unk> a newspaper style format
2 right outside the castle boutique parking lot - so you can see what people look like who go there ! well , the windows face south so not to easily ... but anyway , the pastas were quite good and served piping hot . they have a very small bar
3 great beer , clean & modern brewpub atmosphere , and the food is above average as well . if you 're not into craft beer then you may not appreciate this place . beers are served in traditional <unk> <unk> glasses . seasonal brews offered 4-6 times per year .
2 cool theme with music along the route , but organization and execution of the start and finish are inconsistent , and sometimes very frustrating . the end location needs better access to key roads for ability to move people out of the area , and parking in downtown tempe is
2 out of beer ? how does a brewery run out of nearly all of its own beers ? thank goodness they had a few guest taps , but even then they were n't exactly stellar choices -lrb- the grand canyon one , yuck -rrb- . so i , too ,
0 wal-mart ? yes , this place is just like shopping at wal-mart - the annoying door greeter , the predominantly `` rural '' customers , the lack of service in some of the departments , and yet rock bottom prices on many items . worst aspect is the <unk> counter
2 fried apps are decent here and a value at happy hour . they have those silly `` <unk> '' mugs for beer which have the obnoxiously thick glass . this place has an odd menu in that they try to do everything , american , fish , <unk> dishes ,
3 what ? yes that . you said ? who did that ? when ? ben ? i do n't know anyone named ben ? oh ... is this annoying to you ? well it sure as hell is to everyone at our table who ca n't hear a damn thing
3 great selection of wine , beer , & spirits here ... though not quite as good as the glendale location . single malt guy does n't really know much either , so as long as you know what you 're looking for then you should be set . parking can
3 haus murphy is the only authentic german bar/restaurant in the west valley . they have 10 taps -lrb- <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> marzen , <unk> , and a couple more ... -rrb- . service is usually good and it has a very charming ,
4 the best thai in the phoenix ... this place could hang with the best in the country . highly recommend the salad rolls and boat .
3 great patio setting , solid bloody mary and excellent breakfast items . a place to be seen in scottsdale , which was n't very appealing .
3 great stadium , weak fan backing like every other losing team , but good <unk> options and every seat has a good view .
3 really good pizza , with tasty crust and excellent flavor from the sauce .
2 went on a friday night around 7 pm without a reservation and was told that it would be about a 45 minute wait . they directed us next door to astor house where we could have some drinks and appetizers , so that 's what we did . there ,
3 nothing beats homemade pho but this comes pretty close . it is the best pho that i 've had in phoenix and super cheap .
1 i do n't know why i do this to myself ... how long does it take to make a bowl of delicious and nutritious oatmeal , complete with cinnamon , <unk> , maple , raisin 's ... you know something good for me ? i 'll tell you how long
3 i have been craving vietnamese food for a while . i used to go 2-3 times a month to a little place in oakland , ca when i lived in sfo and got addicted . i had tried a couple of places here in scottsdale 2-3 years ago with less

3 do you know what they have at butterfields ? they have a belgian waffle -lrb- and i <unk> because it 's important here -rrb- with <unk> up bacon in the waffle ... in the waffle ! they cook the bacon into the waffle right in the old waffle iron :

2 i am a huge fan of roy 's -- i am from hawaii so i have eaten at the roy 's in waikiki several times and the one in hawaii kai once . every meal has been really , really , really good ... i dream of them ... lol
4 wow , this place is popular ! i met a friend here at 11:30 am on a saturday and there was a little group of people waiting . i was told the wait would be 20min , but was seated in 10min , so that was a good start .
4 thai basil 's signature dish is amazing . i love going here . the plate is big enough to share and if you get the tofu extra crispy , it comes in little strips . sooo good .
3 not all that friendly here , but it is easy to get the security if you are prepared . also , the layout for walking is terrible , but compared to other airports , it is great for driving into .
3 i was shocked to see all the negative reviews of this place . i have been to each and every location and there would not be crowds of people most of the time if these reviews were to be believed -lrb- the angry vegan made me lol -rrb- . seriously
3 $ 3 miller light bottles ? yes please ! this place is almost entirely patio , and has a cute little upstairs patio area . kind of divey , but really , one of the more casual spots right in the middle of old town that i will always stop
3 i had previously visited the humble pie in scottsdale a few years ago and was slightly underwhelmed , so i was not making a mad rush to try the new location in phx . i did purchase a groupon and on a lazy sunday night the bf and i decided
3 i love me some ticoz ! after our first 5 hour brunch here , the waitstaff and bartenders remembered us down to our drinks and that we liked our bloody 's spicy . they have a great deal for brunch , menu items for $ 9.99 and $ 2 <unk>
3 all menu items are excellent !
3 i enjoy your filet ... i request they cook it with no butter or oils , and they are always happy to make my request ... so thank you outback : -rrb-
0 ill never return to this location . i always order my filet and veggies with no <unk> oil ... and tonight i ordered the same ... except what came out tasted and looked covered in oil , butter and seasonings . the worst part is when i asked about it
3 a half order of the fries is plenty for 2 people -lrb- imho -rrb- . w and i split the chinese chicken salad and a delux burger . the salad was so huge and they already split it into 2 bowls i had to make sure that it was just
4 wow , everything said before me is true . love it . hate it . whatever , but when you go there definitely be prepared to dig for treasure . never go on the weekends -- way too crowded . my latest i have to have it but do n't
3 i enjoyed the dark , cozy atmosphere and unassuming location . the food is pretty good . i had the seabass which was very tender . we shared the roast garlic platter . my only complaint : i thought the fish entree was way overpriced at $ 34 . try
4 solid dining experience all around . apps were great -- mushroom fry and <unk> dip thing . i had the <unk> . duck meatloaf was a little strange , enjoyable but perhaps not the best use of duck . i love foie gras , so that was fantastic . j
2 we go for happy hour though last time arrived too early and had a late lunch . waiter was nice and very efficient . my loves the burgers . cobb salad was quite good and reasonably priced . wine priced a little high . good enough place to go
3 first time . came to watch a game on big screen . staff worked hard to accommodate us . lots of screens had to show lots of games of different kinds . our waitress was very good : attentive , helpful , kept track of our needs and the place
2 the burgers were very good and fairly priced though with no sides . if this were a normal restaurant that would bring me back . the beer selection was adequate . although at least one other review complained about only having arizona beers i thought that was a strength .
3 what a great great bar . i love coming here in the day and relaxing all day with friends . it is such a chill place . the food is pretty tasty and the waitresses are always cool . there is a mix of everyone there from <unk> , to
0 i have to agree with most . fly another airline . this sucks . crummy seating , delays , they nickel and dime you . fly southwest if their is an option .
2 i actually would give this place 21/2 if i could . -lrb- come on yelp let us give 1/2 stars !!! -rrb- i think the presentation of the place is nice , and it is fun to come in a group for happy hour , but i think that in
2 this is like <unk> stars . . the food was good . i had a chicken burrito and the place reminded me alot of chipotle which i like . in fact , i think the idea was kind of lifted from chipotle . but the burrito was very good .
3 went with my cuz for thanksgiving dinner . -lrb- not a traditional turkey lover -rrb- good times . really liked the decor . very trendy and modern . loved the piano player . i wish there were more bars like this around here . food was great . service was
1 f this place . seriously ... well , maybe not . the staff is really really cool and the chicks in the nurses outfits are hot . but , seriously ... wtf <unk> i felt so sick after eating at this pit . i really do n't ever want to
3 great new find for us , we stumbled across it on a sunday and were trying to find a place and not many were open in the area . we saw it and all the cars <unk> sunday and thought , why not ? glad we did , very tasty
4 still a big fan , wonderful pizza !!! -- remember to join their birthday club !!! -
3 que bueno ! we got the opportunity to enjoy el encanto recently -lrb- for brunch -rrb- and we really did enjoy it ! we had different selections along with some traditional brunch <unk> . the chorizo and eggs was very tasty , the fresh fruit , the made to order
2 today -lrb- <unk> -rrb- at camelback ranch - glendale was better , still not my favorite park , but getting there earlier with fewer seats sold does make a real difference . the concessions seemed to have their act more together today as well .
4 i love sushi , i love local , and i love happy hours . akaihana satisfies all three and i 'm there at least once a month . the happy hour menu is excellent and gives you a wide variety of things to order , from miso soup or cucumber
3 went there with hubby and mother in law . they bring out chips and salsa and bean dip at the beginning . i 'm not a mexican food expert but we all loved our food . i ordered the shrimp enchilada and after trying the other dishes , thought that
3 i love curried chicken and the yellow curry actually had a good selection of veggies not the typical potatoes , so i was pleased ! good prices , good service . brown rice , always another plus for <unk> try to stay away from the white carbs when at all
4 now this is a real brunch ! i got a whole wheat egg white chorizo burro that came with a side of potatoes and a side of summer fruits for $ 6.95 much better than my experience on mother 's day at earl 's patio ! this place has the
3 love it , love it every time i go !!!! : -rrb- they are known for their corn bread it is so good ! the other food is very good too .
2 the stadium was beautiful ! the parking was not organized very well and was 20.00 pretty pricey .
4 this is exactly what the scottsdale & shea area needed !! -lrb- remember when that intersection had lots of boozing options ? -rrb- get a beer sampler -- you must try them all ! de-lish i appreciate that a brewery finally put some thought into offering wine too ! i
3 lunch review : great quick lunch options . i 'm a big fan of the lunch salads . they are very filling -lrb- paired with the free chips and salsa !! -rrb- my favorite is the chipotle chicken salad -lrb- mixed lettuce , black beans , roasted corn , cheese
3 great place for happy hour ! the food is great as well as the drinks . my girlfriend had the ` fire and ice ' and she loved it . they had oak creek hefeweizen on tap which is one of my favorites , and hard to find . i
3 definitely one of the best breakfast places in town , as evidenced by the long lines outside . the place next door , liberty market is good too , but the farmhouse is worth the wait if youre craving breakfast . the decor inside is very rustic and comfy .
3 this is one of the better self-serve yogurt places in town . their flavors are very inventive and rotate on a regular basis . the yogurt itself tastes better than other places i 've tried . seems like the put better ingredients . their toppings are also a wider selection
3 we went here last night with a group of 8 friends . i had gotten take out from here once before but never dined in . the service was great , fresh pitas were brought out immediately with <unk> . the waiter did a good job answering any questions for
3 i love the idea of a local neighborhood mom-and-pop pizza place . spinatos is where i go when i 'm craving thin crust pizza ! their restaurant has a very cozy feel inside and small outdoor patio . it 's always packed inside but i 've never had to wait
3 padres is a hidden gem in my opinion . its a tiny spot that comes off like a hole in the wall mexican place . if it were n't for the large neon signs at night one could easily miss this place ! we sat outside in the patio and
4 omg , scottsdale sunflower is the best place outside of tempe to pickup on chicks who do n't shave their arm pits . oh , and it also happens to be the best place in the area for produce , really effing good cereal -lrb- the peanut butter <unk> <unk>
0 ever see the 2 girls , 1 cup video ? i think i 'd rather try that than ever eat at tortilla factory again . it 's that bad . really . the worst -lrb- in every way -rrb- restaurant i have ever been to . in my entire life
4 it 's what a hamburger 's all about . ever smoke crack ? i have . while eating a double double off the a $ $ of a stripper . just like <unk> <unk> in harold & kumar . except it was a double double with grilled onions , not
3 their strawberry pancakes are effing amazing ! well , at least the syrup is -- they make it with your order . no joke . the pancakes themselves are pretty good . orange table is one of -lrb- if not # 1 -rrb- our favorite places for breakfast in scottsdale
4 `` no spice '' , `` small lunch special '' , <unk> ... ignore all the babies . they 've never even had real thai food . thai basil is effing awesome . and so is the family that owns the place . now , before all you haters get
3 i 've been to copper star since it first opened , pre-yelp days for me and my <unk> ways were still being established but <unk> my first copper star experience i 've been in love with this coffeehouse . i just love their place , the former gas station turned
3 yea it still <unk> its 4 stars and this has been confirmed with my love of the oatmeal stout . i guess i never realized how good a pint of this stout but had a pint of it last friday and enjoyed every sip of it . yes it 's
3 this bar has been part of the valley gay scene for so long ... from what i 've heard it 's been around here for more than twenty years , another landmark but what impresses most is not solely its longevity in phoenix but that its been in old town
4 oh tj 's what would i do without you ? shop at whole foods ? no , too pricey . shop at sprouts ? eh , i like their produce deals but it ends there . tj 's is my favorite grocery in which i tend to do most of
2 so ... let me tell you that i will always be and forever be an in-n-out fan , my stopping by five guys was based solely on <unk> on why this burger joint was the favorite of president obama . as i was driving down val vista last night ,
4 yum to all things creative and delicious !!! i 'm finally on the sweet republic bandwagon and clearly a fan ... and yes i have seen the sweet republic light ! i love the creative flavors chocolate guinness , white rose , jalapeno avocado , mango lassi , the cheese
1 i 'm a yelp <unk> and i usually expect the best experience when i 'm trying out a yelp reviewed established that has earned a good amount of great reviews . ok , maybe in this case four reviews was really taking a chance on a new place but i
2 if i had to recommend a mill ave staple , a must to try and visit at least once on a night out on mill ave , i would say the tavern . it 's interesting how this place has progressed from just another bar on the mill circuit to
3 thanks to sara v. i learned about total wine & more through her and when i heard they were opening up locations in phoenix , i was excited . anywho , 6 visits later , i can honestly say i 'm a fan of total wine and <unk> than bevmo
2 love their lunch here . it 's an excellent value . you get crispy won ton 's , salad , and an entree for $ 7 - $ 9 . it 's quite a bit of food so i always take some left overs back with me . however ,
3 i love poncho 's . i grew up in south phoenix so my family and i came here all the time when i was a kid and i continue to make the drive back here years later and always bring new friends to try the place out . my favorite
3 i like this location better than the one in old town , which is the only other location i 've been to . it 's a pretty small restaurant , but they also have a small private room in the back for gatherings . the ingredients all taste fresh and
1 i was not a fan of this location , the service here , or the food . it just tasted different . too bad because this one is a lot closer to home .
2 came here for hh on friday and had a pretty good time . no drink specials for hh , but they have a pretty decent appetizer menu with about 6 different things for $ 2.95 . we ordered 3 appetizers , a glass of wine and a beer and paid
3 came here for az restaurant week . this place was completely packed on a tuesday night , but we 'd made reservations ahead of time so we were immediately seated . this place is dimly lit , but not to the extreme where you can not read the menu without
4 i visited pizzeria bianco last spring after my boyfriend and i checked out the <unk> exhibit at the arizona science center . it was just around the corner . we got here at about 3:30 on a friday and there were already more than a dozen people ahead of us
0 gross . this tastes nothing like mexican food . tastes like they heated up some jose ole in the micro . never going back . i did n't even pay for this meal and i ca n't think of one good thing to say about this place .
3 do n't be scared away from the location . i 've only been here at night , but the area looks deserted . the sushi here is so fresh and good . i completely agree with another poster who said it just melts in your mouth . and let the
3 my mother-in-law invited me out to thirteen north a while ago for happy hour when my husband was out of town . northern is a little bit farther than i normally like to go for happy hour but i made an exception . i was so glad i did .
3 why do my husband and i keep coming back to the blue moose ? two words my friends : tater tots -lrb- well that and the moose decor . -rrb- my husband started bringing me here about 5 years ago when i moved with him back to phoenix -lrb- he
2 eh ... this pita jungle is in my hood so my husband and i used to go here a lot . lately we 've avoided the place because the service is sub-par . allow me to get on my soap box for a minute . i 'm a <unk> kind
3 really friendly staff and pretty good thai food for the price . i ordered 3 entrees and a thai tea and the total was $ 34 . not bad and the portions were pretty big . the curry was a bit too spicy for me but the pad thai was
4 wow , i love this place on sundays ! the patio and the music make me feel like i 'm on a beach in cali ! great mental escape . the sangria -lrb- 3-stars -rrb- was not the best i have had but was still good . the bruschetta -lrb-
3 went to u.s. egg for breakfast and i have to say it was better than i expected . i had coffee -lrb- so-so -rrb- and the protein pancakes with the ham and sausage scramble . the pancakes were awesome ! i 'm in love : -rrb- i must have the
3 their food is always wonderful and service is outstanding . i ordered kung pao two -lrb- chicken and shrimp -rrb- .

3 on the way home from work yesterday , a friend wanted to meet up at america 's taco shop for a snack & catch up conversation and <unk> -- you know me , i 'm all about good tacos & <unk> ! i ordered the carne asada burrito -- delicious
3 love this place . great service . huge portions . love that i never have to ask for a refills on drinks . every dish i 've ever had at this great place has been delish . i 'm hooked . we go here at least once a month .
4 i 've been to this cozy little spot on indian school road a few times . the first time it was quite busy & packed and did n't really get a chance to get a feel for the place . we only had drinks but the service was outstanding .
3 i 've passed by grimaldi 's pizzeria almost day in an day out and ever realized i was passing a fabulous pizzeria ! good friend , <unk> , mentioned that we should consider dinner after our group run so that she could use her birthday discount . to be honest
4 met friends for happy hour here . love this place . appetizers that we shared were delicious . the buttermilk chicken breast and potatoes entree was perfect . i did sample the pork loin -- wow !!! yes , this place is another fave . cheers ***
3 i 've been an ikea shopper for years . whether it 's tempe , seattle , or philly , all ikea stores are the same . cute little displays that make you want to redesign all of your living spaces , tons of shoppers , items that you did n't
4 hands down , best brewery in the east valley ! it 's a pretty bold statement , but they win based on atmosphere . indoor and outdoor seating -lrb- complete with bar seating -rrb- ... some of the other outdoor patrons had their dogs with them . i do n't
4 when a party of 9 walks in during lunch and 2/3 of that party is made up of children under 8 , you 'd think most waitstaff would give an eye roll and <unk> sigh . not at liberty market . as soon as we were half way in the
3 i 've been to the olive mill several times over the last 3 years , and have never had a bad experience . the food has always been great ... fresh , light , some of it 's local . there have a huge , open , outdoor seating area
3 my wife and i have been coming to mbfgr for a few years while going to the chandler mall area and have always had great experiences . i 'm not very adventurous , and always end up with the gyro platter -lrb- a ton of gyro meat , tasty potatoes
4 maui dog has been the talk at the office for the last month so i decided to crash a lunch group and join . after hearing from countless people how amazing this place is , i was surprised when we pulled into the parking lot . normally i do n't
4 best grocery store anywhere , simply because they have a bar in the middle of the massive store with several micro brews on tap , a wine bar , and a few flat screens . grabbed a beer here one night with a buddy -lrb- seriously , i did -rrb-
2 cool looking place , it is very small . they do have a small bar inside . i had an omelet i think called the florence , it was made from egg whites and had ricotta and spinach inside . it was good but a little greasy and the ricotta
2 the cafeteria setting was always a turn off for me but finally gave in to giving it a shot . salad was <unk> some of the tomatoes were bad . but i thought the pizza and pasta were pretty good . i would definetly go there next time a pasta
4 i do miss the desert ridge location , and its large patio - but i always did think the old town scottsdale location had more ambiance . we just do n't get here as often . it is a relaxed , roomy atmosphere . this is one of the first
3 technically this place is a chain , so i do n't think i 'm supposed to like it . the cantina is beautifully decorated and i wish they would use their larger patios during good weather , but so far they have a ton of outdoor space that they are
4 hands down the best breakfast i 've had in phoenix ! i 'm in love , if i could take this place home , i would take it out to brunch at local breeze the next morning . the atmosphere is amazing the patio area is great i felt like
4 definitely the best chicken salad sandwich i 've ever had ! i 'd driven by this place a hundred times and finally stopped in . i got the soup and sandwich combo everything was delicious chicken was fresh and not overloaded with mayo , broccoli cheese soup was perfect .
4 perfect bar for the best hotel in scottsdale . the service is amazing ! the bartenders are do friendly . the drinks are great and the food is wonderful too . great views and it 's a very relaxing atmosphere . i would return even if i was n't staying
0 made a reservation for 7:15 pm . got there at <unk> . was super loud !!!! was told i could be seated and then given a <unk> and told it would be a 5 minute wait . 30 minutes later i still was n't seated and i gave back the
4 love the atmosphere . great pizza ! really unique choices and so many of them . this is a definite new favorite and i will be back <unk> as soon as i can because it was such a delicious meal and there are so many other things i want to
4 no matter where or when this restaurant is always great for a simple meal . something for every mood on the menu and everything is always good . you can be as healthy or <unk> here . it 's all there .
3 this place was so much fun ! the band was absolutely amazing . the only reason they did n't get a 5th star , was because i asked the hostess a few days beforehand if there was dancing , and she said `` yes , the band is awesome and
4 wow ! such a beautiful place ! from the golf course to the bars and outside patio , it 's great . we went there for <unk> and it was awesome !
4 we loved this place . we went just the two of us and were blown away . we initially were going to go to the little burger joint across the way but decided we wanted something a little more special . we split a dinner for an easy 12 bucks
4 mmmmm ... greek frys anyone ?!? i did n't even know what i was missing out on ! and the vibe in this place is fantastic , everyone is super friendly . i went in for a to go order and was asked 4 different times if i had been
4 <unk> seriously , wow . we took the kids here one night when we were looking for someplace good to eat . we were going to go to america 's but we used to live there , so we tried this place out instead . it 's right down the
3 i went here with some work friends and was surprised at the nice atmosphere of the place . we sat outside , and i brought my 7 year old with me . the soft pretzel was delicious , the service was great , and the crowd was cool . it
3 i really like this place , but ever since fresh and easy popped up behind me , it takes a lot to get me to drive the extra five minutes . things are a pretty good price , and i love the samplers . . but f & e has
2 tater tots ! and i get to take my doggie to the outdoor patio . and there are beer buckets . <unk> !
3 copper star coffee is <unk> with a nice , mellow atmosphere and quiet ambience . i do n't normally drink coffee so they served me up an enormous glass of iced green tea and a huge cupcake from the case . the cupcake tasted a little <unk> but the iced
3 i love how i can bike here -lrb- plenty of bike racks ! -rrb- and enjoy the patio outside -lrb- gorgeous days -rrb- or the <unk> inside -lrb- need alone time -rrb- ! drinks are good and service is excellent , especially if you are ordering food . of course
2 i thought this was a gay bar ... uncle stinky poo has been trying to convince me that it is not . maybe if they lost the <unk> , wild neon colors , and the <unk> <unk> track from 2003 , i might believe him .
2 i had to give this place three stars as an average of two and four from the two times i have eaten here . the first time service and food were beautiful . actually , both times service has been top-notch . never a problem with service . i again
3 good rotating selection of mid-century furniture and furnishings ... and other random stuff , depending on what day of the week you show up . <unk> vintage , fifties , <unk> , rockabilly , mod , classy , retro , unique .
3 i pretty much love everything there is about greek food . i would be happy with absolutely anything off a greek menu . that being said , you 'd think i would be a little more picky considering this is a chain restaurant and not a traditional mom-and-pop shop .
4 came here for happy hour and it was excellent . i had flavored $ 5 martinis , <unk> oysters -lrb- which were amazingly fresh -rrb- , 1/2 off their meaty , <unk> crabcakes and 1/2 off a gigantic plate of calamari . they do n't open until 4:00 pm and
0 i can not believe this national chain gets away with the <unk> conditions that are found in this store . customers clearly do n't care about how they treat the merchandise -lrb- and themselves -rrb- and employees could n't give less than a shit , either . i came here
4 ocean club was the 2nd leg of our progressive dinner last night -lrb- <unk> -rrb- it was my dining companions birthday celebration and he had never been before . i chose ocean club for our main course . we were greeted promptly by name and seated immediately . i had
3 another amazing meal at maggiano 's ! thank you to tracy for her great service and attention to our meal . eggplant parmesan is the best ! what a deal , but 1 <unk> , take one home for only $ 12.95 !!! love maggiano 's since living in chicago
4 across the street from postino , <unk> to churn - downtown 's answer to ice cream after many years without -lrb- been talking about this forever ! -rrb- . saturday 's happy hour included $ 5 draft pitchers of craft beers , including seasonals from across the country - this
2 no real complaints , just nothing that blew me away . decent tap selection . decent liquor selection . both soups partook were quite good . service was quick . music was very hip , yet the crowd -lrb- at least at the time we were there -rrb- was the
3 <unk> man , i love america . i gathered two of my other , uh , `` <unk> '' ladies to try this place for the first time . i wanted almost everything on the menu , so the best option was obviously the lolo 's famous <unk> platter .
3 i love this place . yes , it is always busy and no , it is not easy to find parking , but i do n't care . i do n't come here to have a quiet evening , and i do n't come here to be astounded by ambiance
3 hot , fresh , and most importantly , tasty ! my burger was huge and messy , with added real , thick bacon , and spicy grilled jalapeos . i shared an order of fries with my sister , and it was plenty for the both of us . and
4 this is my favorite restaurant at the moment .
4 free wifi , large selection of quality tea and coffee , very reasonable prices , great atmosphere .
4 this place should be a case study of how a restaurant should be run . from the way they prepare to food to how they serve it , customer service , quality , amount , and prices of food , and atmosphere . great .
2 i still miss zen 32 ! i really like the vibe <unk> but everytime i go for sushi at stingray my pocket book is much lighter and i leave wanting more and better . the deck that they put in is freaking amazing and they have a pretty good hh
3 safeway 's are great now . . they have re <unk> the <unk> and put in a nice deli type place ... they offer pre-made salads that are actually good , fresh sushi , good sandwiches and wonderful soups ... since i work in the area i eat lunch there
3 this place is awesome ... they have great thin crust pizza and fresh veggies for their salads ... they have the greatest lunch special ever ... i do n't remember exactly what it is but a drink and 2 slices for like 4 bucks ... do n't let the outside
4 i love this place ... i ca n't think of a better place to eat pizza in the valley ... take that pizzeria bianco !!!! all of the pizza is great and the place has a great vibe . if you are a fan of lgo and the vig this
3 nice place ... i went here after seeing all of the reviews . i think that everyone summed the place up pretty good . i was <unk> by how many different ethnic foods they had ... from italian , to korean , to thai and even sushi . i very
4 i liked this place ... it is owned by the same person that owns sauce , bloom and the green house ... i love the dining room ... they have nice loungy couches that make it a private dinner ... i can not complain about my meal -lrb- or the
3 mmmm indian fry bread . is it a cake , bread , pastry or other delicious baked good ? is it for breakfast , lunch , dinner or dessert ? its all of these things ! so far i 've only tried this mysterious disk in its sweet dessert form
3 despite knowing better . . i stopped by here for dessert last night . as long as your aware of what an oz looks like this is a heck of a deal . they have a huge selection of flavors and those horrible people make them all good . this
3 i had avoided this place for a long time . reason being was some terrible review about it somewhere when it first opened and i do n't even remember where . one of my famous saturday nights i was on a sugar <unk> basically walking around eating everything in sight
4 i 'm loving this place !!! this is why people move here . a little rain , and not much more . the sun shines when the snow falls elsewhere . i can ride my bike in <unk> of on the east . i like that i get to wear
3 omg ! who ` da thunk that home cooking could be made for the masses day in and day out . this place had rib sticking food and the best lemonade i 've had in a while , it was drank in a jar ! we arrived about <unk> pm
1 a place that still <unk> fashion ; even after its <unk> and <unk> of the building that once housed a top of the line department store . if only i could give it a higher rating , based solely on that , but alas this review is about the food
1 meh , i 've experienced better ... to bad the food had to suffer the wrath of the horrible service dolled out by cr <unk> g. it actually looked delicious , would have been fabulous had the sucky server been courteous enough to do a check back , at anytime
0 sorry family but ... nando 's is nada ! an extreme exercise of the gluttonous gilbert arizona restaurant fest . same typical <unk> : after fighting for a spot in an <unk> parking lot , push through the huge crowd standing -lrb- hardly enough seats -rrb- in the hot lobby
3 if you have time to wait in the long line and cash to pay for the moderately overpriced food , this is n't too bad . since i was feeling <unk> and would rather spend money on my new <unk> clothes , i just got a panini sandwich and water
4 ditto all the previous reviews , i 've been to this place 3 times now and have never been disappointed . this time i shared the <unk> pear and black forest sandwich . and of course potato pancakes . for dessert , we shared an apple <unk> . absolutely scrumptious
3 chic , chic , and more chic . decor : pale blue booths and chocolate tables , an upholstered wall , charming stripped huge floor lamps . to sum it up , clean , simple , and fresh . -lrb- i was kind of disappointed in the bathroom decor ,
3 yes , marjele 's has made it to old town . yes , this is the same marjele 's that you have probably been to before a sporting event in downtown phoenix , but this is marjele 's with the old town twist . that means , this is marjele
3 if the secret garden needed a new setting , i 'd happily lead them through the gates of arcadia farms . rain or shine , hot or cold , this is the quintessential location for ladies who lunch . gentlemen , no fear , of course you 're welcome too
4 cartel coffee lab has the three c 's ... coffee , cocktails -lrb- well beer but that does n't start with a c -rrb- and cuisine . so with the three c 's , i say , welcome to scottsdale cartel ! although i frequented this location 's former coffee
2 i still love phoenix muni but i do n't love their concessions . while at a game tonight , they ran out of hot dogs , chicken tenders and even spoons . they did n't seem prepared for the crowds even though it was a sold out game . poor
4 yogurtland continues to leave my palate pleased . what sets yogurtland apart from the rest for me is the fact that they consistently change out their flavors and add entirely different ones to the mix , not just varieties of chocolate . recently , i 've seen oatmeal , peanut
4 i have a crush and i 'm not afraid to admit it -- so here it goes . dear essence bakery , i think you and i make a great team and we should never be apart . please check yes or no if you feel the same way .
4 herb box tops my list for one of my favorite locations for lunchtime or <unk> dining , but just recently i experienced sunday brunch here for the first time . this is definitely a reasonably priced sunday brunch option . in fact , it 's the same price as it
3 well , i finally have a better idea of the goal behind scottsdale quarter . during construction of the quarter , they opened up a restaurant here and retail store there , but they never gave much indication on what was going to be placed in the middle . now
3 i wish there was a sprouts closer to me , but when i need my sprouts fix , this is my go-to location . think of sprouts like whole foods eclectic little brother . it 's full of organic cuisine , some of which is really tasty and some that
3 i found a new breakfast spot ! this place is a dive ; a dive you would most likely drive by on a daily basis and never think twice about . at least , that 's what i did ! but , i can now say that i will never
3 big , juicy , burgers ... sam fox style . the burgers here are juicy and delicious . the fries are just as good and very salty -lrb- in a good way -rrb- . i especially enjoy the multiple dipping sauces they offer to accompany the fries and i always
4 buttery , bbq goodness ! this is by far some of the best bbq i 've ever had and definitely in the top tier of best bbq i 've ever had in arizona . it 's been on my list to visit bryan 's , especially after reading so many
3 it 's not about the food or drinks here , it 's strictly about the atmosphere . you can stop in for dinner and drinks and watch the diamondbacks play while you dine ! located inside chase field , friday 's front row literally provides a front row seat to
3 walk into angels trumpet house and it feels like you 've left phoenix and entered a city like sf 's establishment . at least that 's what i think . the vibe here is very cool , urban , indie , and just simply <unk> . it 's <unk> because
3 it 's now 2012 and the old town farmer 's market is definitely booming in the new year ! i visited the market this past saturday and was blown away by the number of local vendors and crowd ! from organic lotions and dog treats to fresh produce and homemade

3 if i 'm craving a slider on the go while shopping at the mall , this is a great go-to place . i can order two sliders for an incredibly reasonable price and everything else is a la carte . they sell salads , fries , sliders and sodas here
3 if anything could get me up in the morning , a shop like scramble is it . i finally had the chance to try scramble and it 's apparent that i 've definitely been missing out ! on your typical saturday morning , breakfast joints can be <unk> and require
3 surprisingly enough , i do like this zipps better then the other one . i think it might be because it 's off the beaten path , but it 's a sports bar for the times you want to watch a game without running into the world . at least
3 while running around today , i had to make a stop into lee 's and of course my will power had the day off so i could n't leave without making a purchase . because they do n't have mini sizes , i asked for only a partial cup and
4 it was a monday and there 's nothing too great about mondays . it was lunchtime and it was hot outside . i did n't bring my lunch into work so i had to go somewhere . i sat and <unk> about where to go . i started driving and
4 this has always been one of my favorite restaurants in the valley . it reflects the feeling of old phoenix and it makes you feel like you are visiting your friend 's beautiful southwestern estate . plus , i could probably eat a dozen of their sticky buns in one
2 everything from atmosphere and service to food and drinks was just a-ok here . upon arrival , we were seated on the outdoor patio . although it sits on street , the charming twinkle lights and outdoor fireplace makes the busy street easily forgotten . at first , our waitress
4 it 's time for another update ! julia baker has moved locations to the biltmore fashion park and i am so very happy with their new location ! now not only do they sell their delectable truffles but they also have a cafe complete with mochas , sipping chocolate ,
3 i 'm adding one more update to my review . as i 've mentioned before , the mediterranean chicken salad is my favorite salad on the menu but while dining with my mom i learned a helpful tip that makes the salad even better . yes it is possible to
3 patties ... where everybody knows your name !! or they will eventually if you visit enough . ok , so this is your typical dive bar filled with the awesomeness and character that any dive bar should have . it 's right in the heart of old town , so

3 <unk> of a <unk> called and would like to inform all recovering addicts to avoid fashion square if you know what 's good for your wallet . but like any addiction , why avoid it when something so wrong feels so right ! so to all you shopping junkies ,

4 one of the best patios in scottsdale . i 'm making a bold statement and sticking with it . when friends come into town and ask me where to go in old town for dinner , i 'll always include az 88 on the list of musts . why ?
3 <unk> hidden in the middle of downtown phoenix , the japanese friendship gardens gives phoenicians a little taste of cultural in the desert . here it costs $ 5 to get in and with that $ 5 admission fee , you will enter a secret garden that is easily passed
3 urban beans is definitely a great find in urban phoenix . while this coffee shop makes its home on busy 7th street , the second i stepped foot inside , i forgot what was going on outside . urban beans has the perfect environment of independent coffee shop meets a

3 another reason that i love the phoenix sky harbor airport is because i can always get through the security in record speed . i have never waited longer than 10 minutes and that is pretty amazing .
4 ready to have fun and get your party on ? this is the place to be . after <unk> several events here i was impressed on how much fun i had . let me start with the bar staff . they are super busy but can hold down the fort
1 disappointed ... food was great but service and management were not up to par . i had the worst experience that no customer should ever go through . i am shocked and lost for words . 1st check-in and experience . wo n't ever return ...
3 taste buds are satisfied . i had been hearing about this place for the longest . since i had a sweet tooth carving i decided to give them a try . all i can say is that i am glad i did . wow ! what a donut . all
3 my new favorite happy hour spot ! 1/2 priced wine -lrb- with excellent options to choose from -rrb- and select appetizers from 3-6 p.m. . the cheese plate could well be one of the best in the valley . four chef selections with crostini and only about $ 8 at
2 i went for happy hour after seeing the steak sandwich on the best thing i 've ever ate : bang for the buck on the food network . it is true that you get a piece of complimentary steak sandwich during happy hour and it 's quite tasty . the
2 this is a `` yay ! i did it . now i can cross that off my list . '' hike for me . it 's very challenging and the summit view is spectacular and it 's a cool feeling to take it all in from the <unk> rock landing
3 went back to listen to <unk> <unk> perform . what a great place to hang out in the neighborhood ! -lrb- although the music started about 45 minutes later than was advertised , which would n't be as big of a deal if it was n't a weeknight ... -rrb-
3 north mountain has a lot to do with why i live where i live . moving to phoenix from a much more urban environment -lrb- dc area -rrb- , i wanted to live some place i could walk a lot . of course , it had been a while since
2 went for lunch today and had the shepherd 's pie . a co-worker had the peppercorn burger and it looked so fancy with an onion ring and pickle skewered on top . the ambiance was more than i expected ! reserving stars until i get to go back for live
3 some highlights on the current menu : ~ buttery , moist , delicious sand <unk> -lrb- a delicate , sweet flat fish -rrb- and an ample portion . -lrb- $ 18 -rrb- ~ smokey okra , complimented by pepper jelly that is reminiscent of something you dip egg rolls in
3 wow ! they do n't skimp on the heat here . the menu 's packed with options and the service was spectacular ! sweet , hospitable , good with selection suggestions . nice wine selection . i hear happy hour is awesome - already starting to plan my next visit
3 i 'm a big fan of the beer selection and the gnocchi bolognese . it 's tough to get a drink from the bar when it 's crowded and you 're waiting for a table .
3 i really have a hard time calling pomeroy 's a dive bar and , when challenged , i ca n't completely justify why i have this struggle . sure , the tables are carved up with things like `` yelp '' and `` i am rad '' -lrb- <unk> ,
2 went here for brunch this morning -lrb- sunday -rrb- and there were a few things that diminished the experience for me : * you claim new mexican grub and then you charge for chips and salsa or sopapillas which are standard complements to any new mexican restaurant meal . *
4 it 's almost not fair to describe a specific meal here because the menu changes and you can not be assured to find whatever is described ; you can , however , be assured of finding <unk> presentation and an outstanding meal . i 've had wonderful short ribs ;
3 experience is the key word for me , when describing r + d . it 's not often you wait in a dark alley to go someplace swanky . once called , up you get a <unk> and an <unk> : `` been here before ? familiar with the rules
3 a huge fan ! but ... why is everyone just talking about breakfast !? if you reserve astor house for breakfast you are missing the best part ! the cocktails . i 'm not even kidding ! all drinks are on special 3-7 every day : progressive wine prices -lrb-
3 still a fan because i love the beer selection , and the venue . but , i want to update because the gnocchi has gotten a little <unk> . not inedible but not as impressive as it once was ... so , i guess , i <unk> my love for
3 so , it can only be a good sign when you walk into a place and see a giant wheel of <unk> , right ? i mean , i 'm pretty certain this italian girl could <unk> herself on one of those <unk> , salty wheels for , like ,
1 i would n't have been able to say `` i 've experienced better '' right after my visit to easley 's , as i am not a costume shop regular , but i had been invited to a decade themed party to be thrown while i was <unk> in austin
3 i have yet to find a bad seat here . even the $ 25 cardinals game tickets are reasonable , though who would n't prefer to be in the $ 75 seats ? that said , food and drink pricing is beyond ridiculous ! do not come hungry ! -lrb-
1 so , i too am a pizza freak . grew up in nyc and florence italy . i have had pizza all over the world . i 'm just not seeing <unk> 's as having good pizza . first time i was looking <unk> to it , having had heard
4 i ca n't imagine anything less than 5 starts . it 's all here . it 's right around the corner for me and when they opened i was n't sure if i was more excited for me or my daughter . it truly is a feast for the eyes
3 last sunday i was out with my brother in law and one of his friends and no one could decide on where to eat lunch . we were downtown coming back from mesa . and decided to come back to the west valley because we know the area . his
3 after spending almost 3 hours at this restaurant on nye and our party having to <unk> some of the nights events . i was somewhat reluctant to go back to cheuvront so soon when some of our friends asked us to go with them after the oye at the heard
1 i hate that they charge 75 cents to use a credit card and that they charge extra to get a flour tortilla on a taco . i have had much better tacos for less money ! i will not return .
1 i do n't understand the hype ! the bread was ok , but they use over processed <unk> ham ! i can buy that at the grocery store . their mayo tasted funny , too ! never going back !
1 not a true jewish deli . the egg salad is terrible ... so sweet . i think it is way over priced for what you get ! i will not return .
1 i do not like this place . i think it is way too salty ... especially the sausage . the pizza is just so so to me . i will not return because for the money , there are better places in the area .
2 of course , the first problem with being a regular here is that you have to tell you friends to meet you at a place called xtreme bean . it sounds like some horrible taco bell concoction . assuming you can move past the name , you might like this
4 without a doubt , one of my top 3 restaurants of all time . certainly the best thai i 've found in the state of arizona . the menu is large , diverse , though mildly pricey . if you 're looking for thai on a ramen budget , i
3 thai basil <unk> the middle ground between pei wei and malee 's on main . the prices are probably the most memorable thing about this restaurant . at $ 6.95 , thai basil might be the cheapest thai dinner i 've had . the food is good also . the
4 zipps , baby ! i love watching the football games here because zipps prepares a giant steamy melting pot of fans <unk> for different teams . even the employees working here show their support for their favorite teams every sunday . i 've only been here on thursdays and sundays
3 i went here when i found out the breaking bad series <unk> was playing at tt roadhouse . it felt nice to walk into a dive bar to watch the show . you 'd think it 'd be a horrible place to watch a show like that at a bar
3 i moved here from sf in june and found an ad for this place in the mail once . it talked about these fresh drinks and delicious mongolian food . i 've had mongolian bbq before and have always been a fan . i thought i 'd give this place
4 i was here with lynn w sat night for dinner and i 've been dreaming about the food ever since . the decor is simple and clean and the space is small . this is an upscale thai restaurant and is pricier than most . they do have a lunch
3 this review is based on the pork products i picked up at the mesa farmers market . i understand they have a restaurant opening soon , and i 'll for sure have to check it out . for $ 12 you get a bag of frozen smoked pulled pork that
4 stopped in here a couple weeks using a groupon i purchased for $ 40 worth of meats . the man behind the counter was friendly and more than helpful , explaining the different <unk> of meat that they carry . excellent service ! i bought 2 strip steaks that i
4 oh my !! not only was this some of the best middle eastern food i 've had in phoenix , but it 's rates right up there with some the best food ever ! and for cheap ! met up here for lunch today with rand h , mike c
4 this place has been great for over 20 years ...
3 great atmosphere here ! if you like fine dinning with your mexican food , you 'll love this place ! you 'll be greeted by a host or hostess once you walk in . this place has a really nice theme and great style of culture . you get chips
4 buca di beppo will fill you up ! i have always been a huge fan of <unk> . the atmosphere in these restaurants are very fun and support the theme they are trying to represent . i really love how they tour you through the kitchen on your first visit
3 so i 've been passing by this place for sometime now , and finally i 've built up the courage to actually stop in and try it . needless to say , i would like to know where i can sign up to be a regular here ! this place
1 in theory this place is a fun concept , food , bar , outdoor playground for adults including , lounging areas , large screen tvs , games and servers to bring you whichever cocktail and snacks you desire and the bonus of valet parking . i came to join friends
1 this was my second visit in years , but first time to this location . i showed up <unk> late to attend a birthday party dinner , took a quick trip to the restrooms -lrb- liked the decor of the restaurant -rrb- and upon returning to the table was surprised
4 i did n't know this location existed until suggested for dinner . when we walked in the place was packed , we were told the wait would be 10-15 minutes but within less than 5 we were <unk> our waiter quickly had chips , 2 kinds of salsa & drinks
1 terrible ! i ordered a huge order an they forgot two things . that 's ok i guess but when i called to inform them that my food is missing , the manager <unk> <unk> with me as if i was lying ! she kept telling me she knows its
4 yum !!!!! this was actually my 2nd time having their pizza , but the first time it was brought to me . this time i went to dc ranch market street to watch my friend 's band rock lobster play . we sat on the patio at grimaldis so we
2 the first time i went here , i got the shredded beef burrito -lrb- $ <unk> -rrb- and thought it was just ok -lrb- it was huge -rrb- . however , i loved their warm chips -lrb- $ .99 -rrb- and guacamole -lrb- $ <unk> -rrb- ! although i 've
2 used to go here often for dim sum and have enjoyed the experience each time . although dim sum is served daily , i 've only visited on saturdays and sundays . gets very crowded after 12pm , so try and arrive by 11am if you want a chance at
3 went here with the supper club in september for a 6:30 pm dinner . this is now one of my fave restaurants . since this place does n't serve alcohol but offers a <unk> option , one of the gals brought two bottles of white wine for our dinner .
3 very `` in crowd '' but not overly snotty . the seating is a little on top of each other but the food and drinks make up for it . they do not take reservations so be prepared for a bit of a wait depending on when you go .
2 ordered chicken club , lots of avocado which i loved . husband ordered double burger , he liked it but did n't rave about it . fries were so/so . his golden and crunchy , mine limp and kinda soggy - i 'll give it another shot before deciding if
4 guava is my favorite but they only have it once a year , get you hooked and then take it away ... birthday cake is strangely addicting pistachio is buttery goodness ferrero rocher is my current addiction my husband loves salted carmel and <unk> they will let you taste as
4 there 's nothing i can say about fnb that has n't been said already , so i wo n't even try . i can only add that the 5 star ratings are legit and nowhere near an <unk> . you are not going to find better food in the valley
4 i 've been eating at miracle mile ever since i can remember , initially at the old christown mall location . for my youth , it was the only <unk> deli i knew . it 's still great after all these years and location changes . i 've since eaten
0 wow . not a good place to go for a drink after work . i went for a work `` happy hour '' to hanny 's last weekend , and could not have been more put off by the rude staff . i arrived and the group i was joining
3 so glad that they opened up a vig in my neighborhood ! huge fan . the atmosphere is fun and cool but not trying too hard , and the servers are always friendly . the food is consistently good . i 'm a big fan of their deconstructed fish taco
2 rosita 's is pretty average . i probably stop in once a year , i stopped in the other week on the way to gammage to catch 9 to 5 . there is nothing outstanding about this place , but nothing to terrible either . the chips and salsa are
2 so the hubs and i were starving yesterday , i say hey its the last day of restaurant week , lets go try out zinburger ... totally did n't read the <unk> that rw is only for dinner , so that was a bummer , but oh well . we
2 5 star for service 2 stars for food = 3 stars so the mother in law calls and says she has a $ 50 gift card to outback and why do n't the hubs and i meet her for dinner . i 've never been . its free dinner .
3 so last monday the hubs and i got invited out to join some friends for $ 3 burgers at maizies -lrb- $ 4 if you add cheese -rrb- for 4 burgers -lrb- all with cheese on them -rrb- and 4 beers our total bill was only $ 30 !!!!!!!! that
4 i 've gone back a few times since my last review . every single experience has been fantastic ! the burgers are pretty good , but do yourself a favor and get the pork tenderloin omfg !!! sooooo freaken amazing ! also their onion rings are pretty much perfect !
0 well i was thinking to myself last night that i would be giving this location a 3 . however , that just went down the drain . last night the hubs and i ate dinner here . i am currently on this strict vegan diet , so i asked the
3 went to meet up with some family on the east side of town this weekend . i told them i had some diet restrictions and they suggested pita jungle , which i was stoked on as i love me some pj ! i did n't know they had expanded that
3 we hit up the rokerij on friday night for an early bday celebration for the hubs ! sooo glad i made reservations , the line to be seated stayed strong the whole time we were there , one group would get seated as another entered the building , the places
2 it was just ok . we went here on saturday night for the first time , i drive past it every day on my way to and from work and wanted to finally try it out . it was fairly quiet in there and there were a bunch of wait
3 the hubs and i went and saw young frankenstein -lrb- thanks yelp ! -rrb- here last night ! the musical was sooooooooooo good ! so funny ! loved it ! we got to gammage at like 6 and got super front row parking , picked up our tickets at will
4 oh flo 's how do i love thee ... let me count the ways 1 . quickly seated from a sweet hostess 2 . fast & friendly service !! 3 . those little heavenly wanton chips that i dip in flo 's out of this world sweet and sour sauce
3 i had dinner here for the first time last night . its a fun little place . like super tiny . you will feel like you are at a fancy rave or something , the music pumping through there was horrible . the tables are super close together , i
3 this is my go-to theater . there are ones closer to my house , but i make it a point to drive a little further to go to this one . the pros : ** great stadium seating ** reclining chairs ** diy butter station for popcorn with many seasonings
4 definitely one of my new favorite restaurants ! a friend and i went to lunch there last week and it was even better than i expected after reading the other reviews . the menu is extremely extensive . the b-fast all day long is a plus , but i was
3 i 'm a big fan of <unk> ' mongolian style . i love asian food in general , so this is right up my alley . -lrb- i must be out of the loop and <unk> because i have absolutely no idea what this yc is that you speak of
2 the original location . i 've heard great things about this place and was excited to walk in for happy hour . unfortunately , from my first step inside i was quite disappointed . partly because i imagined the inside of the restaurant to resemble their outside patio seating and
3 the summit trail has to be the most deceiving trail ever . the peak is not visible until you get about 10 minute hiking distance so even if you think you 're there ... you most likely are not . but the view is amazing and you literally feel like
3 very cute , order before seating yourself breakfast joint . must start off by saying their coffee is amazing - full refill station right smack in the center of the restaurant too ! as for the food . . i have n't tried everything on the menu but based on
2 cute lunch spot especially on a warm arizona day ... which is like everyday . the outdoor patio makes you feel right at home as well as the tiny birds that fly right in front of your face . i felt like i was sitting in my own front yard
2 went around 1pm on a saturday for lunch and was surprised to find nobody waiting beforehand . the restaurant was half empty when we were seated and waitresses were kind enough to check up on us the minute we sat down . i ordered the asian chicken salad which was
2 ate the eggs <unk> which was alright . a little too salty and a little too much hollandaise sauce for my taste . the potatoes sauteed with onions on the other hand did a fine job satisfying my taste buds ! also ordered an iced americano which was n't too
3 what is not to like ? suns or concerts in phoenix right downtown . i saw the rolling stones from suite and let me tell you ... it was sweet ! enjoy !
4 great pineapple martini and some other fruity drink that larry the bartender made us . larry was such an awesome <unk> we decided to eat at the bar . the calamari was so so , good not great . we tried some blacked ahi , salad , chocolate <unk> with
4 pack a bowl . love this place ! super nice staff , the manager always comes by and asks how things are going . love the price and condiments are plentiful . i always have leftovers and they make for a great meal later that night ! packing a bowl
4 first time i have been there in years . my breakfast was pretty good and reasonably priced . coffee was great with sugar in the raw -lrb- a great condiment -rrb- . the pecan cinnamon roll was very yummy . we were there at 11:45 am and were seated right
3 <unk> <unk> . !!!! 1 !!!! i 've been to chino bandido several times , but it 's been close to 3 years since my last trip ... the last few times i had been there were rather unremarkable , but chino got <unk> groove back it seems . the
4 tacos tacos tacos . finally . the best carne asada , i have ever had . i tried the bombero burrito - $ 4.95 ish with green chile pork inside . spicy . awesome . the burrito is served enchilada style , with a smoky chipotle sauce on top +
0 a complete insult to italian cuisine . the calamari was fairly decent however only served with some trashy ranch dressing . . and that 's where the good ends ... the green tea had no flavor . the ciabatta bread was cold . not room temp . out of a
3 i typically despise buffets of any sort , but this one is certainly an exception . i 've eaten here several times over the past 3 years , and it 's always good , and it just seems to keep getting better . . today was stellar ! the sushi
1 maybe i 'm ordering the wrong stuff , but i 've * always * been disappointed in the grub at 5 & diner ... the service was stellar and i really do like the ability to dine <unk> at 3am , but does everything need to be soaked in butter
3 yum yum yum yum yum . friends in town from ohio ! what better visitor friendly mexican place could you possibly take visitors from the midwest ? mi patio !!!! extensive menu , bursting with flavor , and <unk> in the realm of mexican comfort food . reasonable prices ,
4 we saw the artist here the other day ... what a great location to watch it ! i love how this theater is totally taken out of my childhood memory ... no stadium like seating , but still a good view from every seat . they keep this place super
4 these gourmet popsicles are a definite foodie destination !! wow ! now , these are n't your average fruit bars , they are hand made , with fresh seasonal ingredients with no artificial anything ! we stopped in the other evening after a heavy ethiopian meal , and these paletas
2 a fun place for wine and bruchetta . the hummus is delish ! we actually ended up ordering a couple rounds of bruchetta , it was that good . my husband 's favorite was the <unk> with figs and mascarpone cheese . i also had the roasted peppers with goat
4 i do n't really understand the poor reviews on this place ... maybe it depends on the day you go ? we went on a sunday , it was crazy busy , but service was great ! -lrb- of course , my view of customer service is a little different
4 loved this place . super chic and quaint . yes , there are many college kids and lawyers there , but , i kind of liked it . it reminds me of a cafe one might find in san <unk> or brooklyn . the place is huge , so ,
3 have you ever fallen asleep at a night club and woke up there the next morning ? i have n't , but if i ever had , i would imagine it would be like waking up in this place . ncounter could be a `` morning club '' where you
4 delicious . cheap . and fun ! this place is amazing ... fresh , hand-made noodles -lrb- or pulled , i should say -rrb- taste as good as they sound ! they give you a ton of food , and most dishes are under 7 bucks ! you just ca
4 took the mom and sister here for a cool down today and wow ! i had the <unk> , which had the ability to literally fill my mouth with flavor bursting from each little <unk> full of goodness . thankfully i chose the single scoop , because honestly it was
4 i have a shopping problem . by that i mean i will gravitate to the most extravagant thing in the <unk> / <unk> ... whatever . i have a shopping problem . that being said there are a few things that i love and have accepted that will not change
3 not really a review , but definately worth a mention ! monday night pasta special : spaghetti dinner with your choice of one topping . served with either homemade soup or salad and that <unk> garlic toast . all for $ 8.50 . seriously ?!! i have to take over
2 and now ladies and gentlemen , the category tonight : things that make <unk> a-ok in my book . here we go ... # 10 - i can actually understand the people that answer the phone # 9 - the sweet burn on my tongue after eating a mouthful of
2 mi patio is a friendly , welcoming sort of place that you can get a decent meal for little <unk> . the margaritas are n't top shelf , but for the price they ca n't be beat -lrb- and who really cares after the fourth or fifth one ?!! -rrb-
3 mmmmmm mamma mia ! so much has already been said already , but i still feel compelled to throw in my two cents worth ... my ideal friday night ? a medium mushroom pie , extra crispy -lrb- which is still <unk> btw -rrb- with one of their huge antipasto
3 i went on a saturday afternoon with my husband and friends , and the place was packed ! our friends , who had been there before , said sundays are even busier . i really like the boutique . they sell cute t-shirts that say , `` extra virgin ''
3 make your own pizza . fun ! i love the selection of ingredients you can put on your pizza . the restaurant also has a list of suggested pizzas , so do n't be intimidated . great place for lunch .
2 liberty market , i expect more of you . i love liberty market . i come here all the time , and have always had a great experience . because of this , i hold the staff to a higher standard . today though , was thoroughly disappointing . the
1 pros : $ 5 mojito -lrb- drink special -rrb- free entertainment -lrb- <unk> night -rrb- cons : bland food poor service our server admittedly forgot about us a couple times . `` oops , i forgot to bring you <unk> . '' -lrb- insert multiple requests -rrb- i like the
3 this is a very cool place . the food is good , and the vibe is fun . i really enjoyed the banh mi halibut sandwich . i will save room next time to try ice cream at churn next door .
4 i always go here for lunch . the food is fresh and yummy . every wrap and lunch bowl comes with a side of pasta or chips and salsa . parking sucks , so try not to go at peak lunch time . i usually go for an early or
2 my husband and i saw the lodge featured on planet green 's `` best food ever '' series for its <unk> burger , which <unk> buns with grilled cheese sandwiches . we went with a group of friends on a sunday night . it was surprisingly crowded , but we
2 darts and beer . ca n't say much else .
3 had breakfast here the other day . there are n't many places left where you can get a two egg breakfast , with potatoes , and a bagel , for $ 5.99 . the <unk> was delicious , and very well done ! the <unk> o bagel was really delicious
2 went to <unk> for <unk> . my first visit . it 's a beautiful space , open and airy , and well lit . i ordered the basic pita omelette ; the whole dish was a bit dry , so i added some pico de gallo , which helped considerably
3 i returned to hanny 's with the <unk> light rail dine around -lrb- <unk> -rrb- . we were initially served trays of <unk> prosciutto , cheese , pistachios , and cantaloupe . they also brought bruscetta , and tapenade , which was delicious . after a short while , they
1 went to switch as part of the lightrail pub crawl . not impressed . i may go back to experience it as a restaurant , but as a bar it 's nothing i 'd revisit .
4 went to <unk> for the halloween bash . stopped in to <unk> for dinner . my girlfriend 's first time in . we ordered one each of the cochinita -lrb- pork -rrb- , carne asada beef , and pescado -lrb- fish -rrb- tacos . the pork was phenomenal ! great
3 i joined <unk> for lunch at <unk> . i had the <unk> deal . -lrb- quarter <unk> , and i opted for the seafood gumbo -rrb- if what i had constitutes a quarter of a full sandwich , i could feed my family on one <unk> ; it was huge
4 took my mother , and my daughters to dinner <unk> tonight . once again had the lovely <unk> as our server . had an order of lumpia , which my mother , and my daughters enjoyed very much , including the peanut sauce . i ordered the shepherd 's pie
4 i 've been three times now , and they have not lost steam . last night i enjoyed several glasses of the lips of faith <unk> -lrb- i had a designated driver -rrb- , and i got to sample a new brew , but the name escapes me . our
3 went there for a <unk> event . nice location . parking garage is a bit far from the actual restaurant , but whatever . at least they did n't require valet . the <unk> took place on the back patio , which was reserved for the event . really ,
4 popped in here again , during our annual ride to the desert . we split the following : 1 . asparagus wrapped in prosciutto . delicious ! 2 . caesar salad . delicious with homemade dressing . 3 . <unk> al pesto . as good as , maybe better than
4 ... . and still , the best sushi i 've ever had and they always have cute friendly waitresses taking care of business . <unk> has spectacular eyes and a warm smile ! lunch today was deelish and i 'll be going back a few more times before heading back
4 my place for a steak anywhere and always . their service is consistently good and their food quality is top notch . in 20 plus years of dining with them i 've only had 2 mediocre steaks and both times the staff exceeded our expectations in <unk> the matter .
3 went last week for the special <unk> jewish sliders . they were so delicious . not very big though and the regular price of $ 3.99 is a little high . the side order of french fries were quite good . they were even better heated up in my toaster
3 tonight was my 2nd trip to this restaurant . i went several weeks ago for lunch . they had advertised a lunch special on facebook but when i got there was told it was for the previous day but they would try to make it for my anyway . it
3 i had dinner here last week and loved the food . i had red snapper in a crunchy crust , mashed potatoes , veggies , watermelon salsa . this was not on the menu as it was their special of the day . now , i know many people will
3 i love wine bars , but this place really was n't my scene . but the bartender was great , offered personalized service . not sure if i would return here , but it 's not because of the wine or lack of service . this place knows how to
2 the food was ok , nothing great and nothing bad . the service was ok too . again , nothing great but nothing bad either . the only thing worth note was we saw our waitress only once . after she took our drink and food order we were taken
4 i lived in phoenix for years , but never ate at houston 's until my friend <unk> came from wisconsin . we had breakfast there , and the food was great . we ate at the bar and the service was good . mimosa was potent as i was tipsy
3 this is <unk> little piece of chinatown . one day maybe , please god soon , we will get a bigger and better china , japan , korean , and thai town like the bay area .
4 this place is great . it really great for family meals . the food is good .
3 as always this place rocks , the new thai beef salad is so good and spicy but the big huge surprise was the big island meatloaf . if you like pig and beef mixed together with a crispy crust then get this piece of heaven .
2 i would have to say `` suprise '' is the first words that come to mind with this hole in the wall or you could say it is the crowds of people waiting to hit this joint all night . i have had better , but the food was good
2 it 's okay , it 's a fun adventure for the kids and families not for a date .
3 great place for when you want to enjoy desert views and outdoor seating . the food is nothing too challenging , southwestern takes on american favorites . -lrb- chops , chicken etc -rrb- . the desserts are a little weak here , but the meal overall can be magical .
2 good but not great . i love the architecture and the location . -lrb- right next to the venerable old , north high school , my alma mater -rrb- . i think it is just a smidge pricey for what you get . service is good . i like the
4 best sticky toffee pudding ever . but before i jump to dessert may i say that this restaurant is a feast for the eyes as well as for a hungry belly . the bread and olive oil is a good way to start . the polenta is delicious , i
4 took me forever to finally leave the <unk> of phoenix to check out curry corner . my only regret , not coming sooner ! super close , right next to asu . fast , friendly service . some of the best garlic and cheese stuffed naan around . had the
2 it 's sam fox . the food is reliable and maybe a dollar overpriced . the food -lrb- which is culinary dropout which is essentially arrogant butcher -rrb- will not offend or disappoint . the salads are tasty and as always the pretzels served with cheese fondue is tasty and
3 breakfast is of course the star . i generally do n't bother with their lunch menu . be warned though , there is nothing healthy on the breakfast menu -lrb- except maybe the oatmeal -rrb- . the eggs benedict is done well and it comes with a mountain of potatoes
4 updating my last review of beckett 's . came back on sunday night , they have half price bottles on az wines and several of my favorites become more than reasonable at that price . was three for three on the menu choices . started with duck confit salad -lrb-
2 good sandwiches , <unk> restaurant . it holds a lot of <unk> and imported items . the sandwiches are pricey but delicious and come with a pickle . worth a visit . -lrb- the downtown location does n't have nearly as much charm -rrb- stick with ordered custom sandwiches and
3 good fast lunch specials . reliable friendly service . i do wish it was a bit more customized . i.e. you sit down , everyone gets the eggrolls and soup . etc etc. . but <unk> for a fast lunch -lrb- not nearly as fancy as <unk> thaiger or even
3 parking can be rough here , and during busy times , good luck getting a table . but your patience will be rewarded . the sushi specials -lrb- on the wipe board -rrb- are never to be missed . the regular menu is filled with flavorful and recognizable dishes but
3 delicious . some of the best hanger steak and <unk> frites . some of the best desserts around with the <unk> and creme brulee . the one thing i do n't like is the truffled ice cream . that was a bit much even for me . <unk> that ,
3 updating my review only to say that the <unk> is amazing . for 11 dollars i know some people will gripe that you are getting raw vegetables , but you have to understand it is a giant , artfully constructed ice cold bowl of fresh , organic vegetables served with
3 one of the few chinese places i actually like to eat at . the portions are not the most generous , but they are prepared with thought and care . it 's not the prettiest place , -lrb- but what chinese place really is -rrb- . it is clean and
3 of the fox restaurants , i think this is one of my favorites . lots of fresh seasonal ingrediants and sea food . the interior is beautifully decorated , regardless if you eat at a table or at the bar , you will get the same attentive service . a
3 the place is scary , if you 're worried about not having windows that is . inside , you 'll find large family style tables and <unk> lighting . you will find surly waitresses who look at you like they really hate you as you order . but you did
3 they are open again ! the green chili soup is delicious and is like playing russian roulette . sometimes it 's super spicy , sometimes its manageable . pork adovada is the standard here . what i like is that you can also order off of the rokerij menu and
3 one of the best bundt cakes or cake in general around . the cream cheese frosting really makes this cake . the cake is moist but the frosting just knocks it out of the park . i usually get the mini cake or if you can get the baby <unk>
3 fez : delicious and garlicky . i will say that service is not the best . they try but always seem to be understaffed . good happy hour specials , sometimes parking can be a bear . good music and good ambiance . their hummus is great , great vegetarian
3 still one of my favorites . the bruschetta is delicious and the fact that you can order different kinds <unk> my <unk> inability to make a decision self . tuesday nights are almost impossible to get a seat at now that they have a special running where you can get
3 love the ambiance . good for groups or casual dates . the salads and sandwiches are okay , the pizza is good . -lrb- although i will say that it does not hold up well for leftovers , it tends to get really mushy -rrb- . i really like the
3 romantic byob place . a little pricey , the food tends towards <unk> influence but tasty . i come really for the desserts -lrb- which they will do for take out -rrb- . a nice place for a lunch or romantic dinner . also , you can have them cater
1 wanted to like the place . so many people seem to rave about it . admittedly i was doing take out and did n't get the full perspective but ordered pad thai and <unk> beef with broad noodle dish and was <unk> . i know that it is `` asian

4 never eaten here , but have partaken in the drinks several times . kazimierz is one of the coolest , most chill places that you will find . great place to hang out with a couple of friends and have a glass of wine or two . they share a
4 if you 're visiting the phoenix area from out of town , this is one of the places that should be on your dining list . don and charlie 's is a cool chophouse in downtown scottsdale that has a huge collection of <unk> <unk> behind walls of glass .
3 the u.s. egg is a very quality breakfast place with multiple locations around the phoenix area . they have a very diverse breakfast menu with plentiful options . you 'll find classic breakfast menu options such as omelettes , eggs benedict , pancakes , and skillets , cooked up with
2 better taste and quality then yc 's . however , way over priced and tiny tiny portions . i was seriously confused when i was handed a tiny bowl to put my food it . i was n't very good at stuffing all the ingredients i wanted into the bowl
1 i do n't understand all of the great reviews of this place . the food here is pretty blah . i feel like they use the same 3 ingredients in every dish , as if they do n't want to actually supply the ingredients that the dishes need . everything
2 should be 2.5 stars ... their chips and salsa , delish . i die . every time . the pollo queso something something ... yummmm , so greasy and cheesy and spicy and <unk> and fried $ 4 dollar margaritas ? ok ! the food here is typical yummy greasy
4 wow wow wow !! i ca n't get enough of zoe 's . the food here is divine . completely supreme . i love it . my faves : - steak roll ups - chicken roll ups - the slaw - rice pilaf - hummus - they have bomb iced

2 i went during lunch and no customers were dining . well , i did have great customer service ! i ordered a bacon burger , fries and pop . it was a good meal . it seemed like my burger experience was above average but not great . the fries
3 great ambiance and bruschetta plate . will definitely be back to try other dishes !
4 been here for both the brunch and dinner . had dinner there tonight ... great server -lrb- funny too -rrb- . we started with some bread - which was very hot and fresh . next , a caesar 's salad and a house salad . both were delicious and very

4 this place has a very retro feel . i love the big booths and the entrance is kinda cool -lrb- you walk through the kitchen -rrb- . great place for a martini for me and a huge steak for the man in my life . : -rrb-
1 oh sandbar i am sooooo confused . do people come here to eat , drink , or dance ?!?!?! it was saturday night , the line was wrapped around the building which is a joke because you do not want to wait to be in this place !!! security everywhere

2 yes , i 'm a vegetarian . no , i do n't like <unk> , <unk> vegetable protein that tricks me into thinking i 'm eating meat . if i wanted meat , i 'd eat meat . that said , there are plenty of delicious vegetarian dishes that feature
3 finally got to try this place out ! i went for lunch on a friday but arrived early because of warning of slow service . these rumors seem to be true . i ordered the watermelon rosewater beverage which was refreshing and not too sweet , and the goat cheese

3 ok ... so after a few minutes of trying to find this place , we stepped into heaven . there is no lighted sign or really any lights outside to tell you where it is , but we found it . we walked in to a very busy place .
4 eat here !! try the ahi tuna sandwich . it is melt in your mouth delicious ! the onion rings are super crunchy and flavorful . the use fresh produce that is grown right outside and use locally raised beef and chicken . which is refreshing . other suggestions i
3 cute little place ! very random , but creative flavors . my niece and nephew were in town for a couple of weeks and i needed somewhere cute to take them ... found it ! they loved the homemade ice cream nestled in between some pretty darn good cookies !

4 i 'm going to take a major risk here and say that butterfield 's is one of the best breakfast places i have been to in the valley . definitely the best one for a sit-down brunch with friends and family . why ? the food is freaking legit .
4 how do you add yelp value to a business that has already been reviewed <unk> times ? what else can i say that has not been said before ? probably nothing , but i do n't write yelp reviews for you , i write them for me . and i

3 i waited over a half an hour to get my sandwich after ordering , i knew it would be a wait going during lunch on a weekday . it 's worth the wait if you have the time !!
4 the sweet potato <unk> is amazing !! dining out as a vegetarian can be tricky if you want something besides a salad . i love that they have a meatless entree , especially one as delicious as this . kudos to the chef !! my boyfriend had the prime rib

4 love all the arriba 's ! very good green chili , made with pork ! white <unk> chimi is to die for !

1 an ok place to bring your kid to play video games , but be advised , load that card with a lot of $ or else you are going to be repeating the <unk> process quite often . each game takes typically 4-6 credits to play . the food was

4 love it ! <unk> huge selection , low prices and friendly staff . it 's my go to place when i need to <unk> .
3 finally . a <unk> place for lunch that has more that just sandwiches and salads . my friend and fellow partner in <unk> -lrb- wait , that makes us sound like <unk> -rrb- and i ended up here after a disastrous -lrb- and <unk> -rrb- trip to the hidden closet

4 i 'd never really think to review casey 's if i was n't leaving but i feel like i need to leave them a love note . casey moore 's has been my go-to late night spot for a long time now . the best part about casey 's is
1 if first impressions could kill ... glenn and bri d. accompanied a friend and i to compass restaurant . after stepping off the fun -lrb- and i mean fun ! -rrb- elevator ride up to the restaurant i instantly felt dizzy - everyone got a laugh when i <unk> asked
3 okay i went here on recommendation from some yelpers and i have to admit a personal flaw ... i add letters into words and flip things around when i 'm reading sometimes , so this whole time i 'm thinking cornish pasty is a pastry -lrb- notice the ` r
0 oops i did it again ... but this time i took pictures ! i still ca n't believe what they charge for a <unk> ' sandwich , which is n't even that big or tasty ! but that is not what brought my update from a 2 start to a
2 i enjoyed a fine bbq lunch today . one element that stuck out to me the most was how friendly the waitress was . we were a group of 15 and asked for separate checks and the girl was still just as nice as can be . she smiled when
1 let 's start with positives ... - large and open entrance -lrb- way better than gammage , which is a never ending hallway -rrb- - intimate <unk> - <unk> staff - bathrooms - they were clean , well lit , well decorated , and smelled good : -rcb- negatives ...
4 you can really tell the sushi room uses fresh quality ingredients . there are great happy hour specials each night . rolls are $ 4-5 . i tried a few different rolls but the vegas roll was my favorite . the atmosphere is trendy and a little more upscale .
2 the museum is medium sized . you can get through the museum in <unk> .5 hours if you go at a moderate pace . the phoenix art museum is free every wednesday after 3pm and every first friday of the month . that being said , i normally do n't
4 may 28 was national hamburger day and the habit gave away free burgers . i had never been here before and a free burger was enough to draw me in . they were giving away `` <unk> '' which are their signature burgers . this was n't any ordinary fast
3 ok , i really feel that this place rocks ... chain or no chain , cf is in another league when it comes to chain restaurants . i have yet to have a bad experience -lrb- or even anything mediocre -rrb- at any of the locations . the overall quality
3 i 've always liked kona grill , especially for happy hour . i think that both the chandler and scottsdale locations have a better `` vibe '' however , this is still one of the more happening places in gilbert on friday and saturday nights . i 've never thought
1 i ca n't exactly review the food because we walked in , sat down and then perused the grill line and walked out . i thought the size of the bowl was extremely small for the price and i just was n't that impressed . i 've always loved yc
3 hands down the best burgers ... fresh and juicy and hand-made . the condiment bar is fantastic and they have <unk> steak sauce !! the patio is really nice , situated in a courtyard and off the street . always a joy to visit this burger joint .
4 not even sure where to start on this review ... i was so very impressed !! had the pleasure of eating here last week and have no clue why i waited so long ! bad gina ! the outdoor patio is fantastic . the are where i sat has some
4 i do n't know where to start on extolling the virtues of aiello 's . i 'm first generation italian , who grew up in pa ... so i 'm a little snobby about my italian food . my mom and dad made the best and dining at aiello 's
3 everybody calm down . put your two door cinema club and andrew bird albums away . i see you have the newest apple product ... alas , they are no <unk> happening at this time for <unk> in this place . ok now i have that of the way .
3 i cant wait for the weekend ! somebody buy me a vig shirt ... i will be the dumb ass poster child wearing it around . taking a quick break from the vig uptown , my mates and i take the extend trip to the original vig . letting the
4 i 've been hear at least four times . each time was different , that can be a good thing and a bad thing . if you are a looking for a good time with poor friends who are stressed after a long and brutal asu finals come here .
2 if you want an atmosphere of <unk> and jersey wearing monotony this is your place . this is not my place . as usual , they make up for the lack of decor and intimacy with very competitive drink specials and food items . their service very personal 5 *****
3 the employees at this location are sooo nice ! even when it 's super busy they are still very friendly . my favorite thing about this place is it 's open 24 hours ! if you want breakfast for dinner or a milkshake at midnight you can have it !
2 after hearing all the hype i was very excited to shop here . for me it did n't live up to the hype . i thought the women 's clothes were okay but nothing i could n't live without and the men 's clothes were a little too fashion forward
3 the downtown phoenix public market is n't has large as other big city public markets but it has really improved over the years . there is a wide variety of items for sale and great people watching potential . i am not a `` granola '' person but the granola
4 i loved everything about this restaurant ! the food was delicious , great ambiance and friendly service . we came on a friday night and the place was packed . i would recommend making reservations because we did have to wait awhile for a table . -lrb- side note -
3 we went here for breakfast last weekend and i was pleasantly surprised . the coffee is there own brand and it has a great flavor . i especially like that they have a bunch of different flavored <unk> . the staff is very friendly and efficient . you can tell
4 this is a great mom and pop type restaurant . they have good food and good service . you walk in and it feels like home . i have ate there a few times now and have had good food every time . the hot burger is unique . the
2 decided to go to hap 's for lunch today from my fellow yelpers reviews . i had the pulled pork sandwich tennessee style , potato salad , cole slaw , and mr <unk> . i will say that when i walked in it was clean , busy , and smelled
4 it 's so good you dream about it , literally i was just salivating like pavlov 's dog , not drooling , thanks to my sweet dreams . no pun intended .
1 i am going to have to take the <unk> side on this . i was not impressed . i had the fry bread with the green chile . it had lettuce and cheese on it , too . so dull and bland . the fried bread was too much and
2 definitely a-ok ! i loved the live music and my dinner was a-ok . i had the burger upon the owners recommendation and he was right . not the best burger of my life but definitely enjoyable . and the <unk> tomato on it was so delicious . i also
3 our waiter was awesome ! i had the steak fajitas and they were totally over priced at $ 18 but some of the best fajitas ive ever had !!! i did n't eat any of the sides or tortillas because the meat portion was so large and that was my
4 if you have n't eaten lunch yet , i suggest you get your cute little butt over to sonora right now . i had the carne asada taco combo on flour tortillas . it comes with two tacos and rice and beans . i also got fresh guac . <unk>
2 my friends convinced me to give this place another chance . the salsa bar is so good . i do n't really recall what i ordered to eat but i do remember not loving it . it was decent though . the salsa on the other hand is amazing !
4 we started with the cucumber , tomato , onion and parsley salad which was amazing . it was super fresh and so tasty . our waitress told us they do n't chop the veggies until someone orders it . i had a chicken kabob -lrb- some of the best chicken
2 * update below * literally right under my office building ! so glad something finally opened up in this space . today i had the flank steak with grilled veggies . it was ok ! i thought the price was just a wee bit high so i probably wo n't
3 roll , roll , roll your joint . twist it at the end . take one puff , that 's enough . pass it to a friend . ya <unk> , i love this place . that song gets stuck in my head every time i go to cheba hut
3 i went here for a large get together over the weekend . our waitress was really great considering the large , drunk group . : -rrb- the only thing i did n't like was the lack of fountain diet coke . it came in a cute mexican glass bottle but
3 i will gladly spend $ 20-something on one meal here . glad . <unk> . this is what i ate : sirloin on the wood grill with green beans . and a side of raw horseradish . i basically licked my plate . it was one of the best steaks
1 katie and i went here on sunday before an ikea trip . let me start off by saying we were seriously starving , i was so pumped to order my jerk chicken salad . we walk in and theres a ` bloody mary bar ' and it looked absolutely disgusting
3 very cute place . we wanted some dim sum but ended up ordering meals . we should have stayed with the dim sum idea bc that was the best part . everything was insanely fresh and clean . the soup , the spring rolls , the dumplings ... yum .
2 went to caffe boa last friday before a movie , the food was pretty good but i was n't impressed . i know fridays are busy at any restaurant , but the wait staff was extremely slow . we did n't have to wait for a seat when we arrived
4 amazing ! , i crave see on a daily basis ! they are absolutely delicious , it 's weird , they are like cupcakes from heaven ! sure 3.50 is a little pricey , but they truly are the best cupcakes i 've ever had . everyone there is always
4 i am usually a chain hater , but there is nothing to hate and everything to love about paradise bakery . the salads are awesome , the sandwiches -lrb- turkey cranberry - <unk> <unk> ! , chicken salad & tuna -rrb- are awesome , and the cookies ... the cookies
0 worst service ever . slow would be a compliment !!! and the <unk> does n't care . oh , and the food sucks and the coffee tastes like water . avoid ...
4 wow ! so legit , the real japanese sushi experience is at hiro . without any special motif or hip scottsdale decor , it 's japanese and sushi at it 's best ! chefs . . japanese , who greeted every person that was walking through the door . it
4 ok , i had the lobster pot pie for dinner ... only thing left on the plate were the peas . . but it was creamy , lots of lobster and a flaky pie crust . . it was awesome !
1 if your grandparents are in town , then they will probably like cracker barrel . very bland menu . my waitress was a little odd and really seemed unorganized with her tables . i ordered the uncle <unk> 's favorite . two eggs with grits , <unk> gravy and homemade
2 co-worker loves , and i mean loves chen wok , and has eaten it for almost an entire week before ... i would n't go that far however , it 's cheap , fast chinese food . . and you get a massive plate of food ! first time ,
0 i am expressing my great disappointment with the service i received from the district in october 2009 . in the beginning of october , i approached the district to see if it would be possible to bring about 70 to 100 people on a thursday night at around 10:30 p.m.
3 i love the building and the ambience of the restaurant . a great place for a business lunch . we did arrive early to get a table for six . the staff was friendly and helpful when looking at the menu . some coworkers ordered the couscous salad , i
4 been here a few times , and have n't been disappointed at all ! servers have always been friendly ; this past time there , the gm -lrb- i 'm assuming -rrb- came by when we were done and took our <unk> was actually a busy friday lunch crowd ,
2 crispy crust and decent toppings on ray 's pizza slices . really inexpensive which was great with me since i had to wait around for a meeting in scottsdale the day that i went to ray 's . the owners were there helping the busy lunch crowd . the pizza
4 beer with brunch ? yes , beer brunch on the weekends at o.h.s.o. ! i 've been here a few times this past year . a few weeks ago , i decided to go and try their beer brunch , only $ 10 with a beer . yes , beer
3 for a chain restaurant , this one is pretty good . i 've had a bunch of items on their menu and are never disappointed . for the friendly service , great food and location , i will gladly spend a few more bucks for a fabulous dining experience .
2 i always drove past this place and wanted to try it , so i made a date take me here . i 'm a burger gal , so when i saw the extensive menu and how many options there were for burgers , i got excited . down side :
3 takamatsu is my kind of place . i 've been going here -lrb- also the one in glendale on dunlap -rrb- for about 8 years , so you know it must be good . this place is great for groups . you can grill your own food right at your
0 so me and my buddy -lrb- coworker who is <unk> -rrb- decide to go to lunch today . what 's the catch ? we do n't know where to go . we decided to go somewhere we have n't tried before that was off the beaten path . enter harvey
3 finding mama mia 's pizza was like finding a $ 10 bill in the gutter . i felt so excited when i saw the pizzas they were making and how everyone was pulling steaming , cheesy goodness from their lips . i dunno if they have chicago style here ,
3 went here for the pet expo . it was a fun time , and there were many vendors . the food offered was limited to u. of phoenix money pockets , so that part <unk> . they had <unk> teas , cheese steaks , salads , hot dogs . there
2 ample parking in back , but spaces are narrow . food is delicious . prices are a bit higher on average for thai places i 've been to around town .
4 first time there . had the chop chop salad with grilled chicken . salad was more <unk> sliced thin . thought it would be large chopped pieces . grilled chicken was tasty ! service was friendly and consistent thru the meal . they even asked if we wanted drinks to
3 pricey , wish serving portions were a little bigger . for that reason i do n't go as often . never have coupons that i see . no discounts for large companies nearby . check your smart phone on their website , they 've had a free drink with meal
4 this is the best noodle soup bowl place i can find in the area . i drive 30 + minutes just to go eat here . they are super fast serving up the noodle soup bowls . today i got one to go and it was ready before i paid
3 our favorite place for vietnamese food in north scottsdale . nice folks running the place . we seem to always get the number 3 but every thing we have had here is good including the pho . there is a nice outside seating area that is great when the <unk>
3 went here for lunch . ordered the lemon chicken with the cous cous . really liked it . sat upstairs which was nice and warm . the salad was very good . the gentlemen next to me ordered the meatballs and they smelled delicious ! would try those next time
3 good solid food and excellent beer . it is busy every day seriously . i even asked the waitress last night what day was n't busy . this is a great place to sit out now that the weather is nice . it is a little warm in the summer
4 at least once a month , we make an excuse to hit teds . the dogs are freakin ' amazing . we also always leave with a jar or two of ted 's red hot dog sauce . do n't order the <unk> and blow your wad on one big
3 impressive !! last time i was here , it was 10 years ago and a very shitty mexican restaurant named <unk> . the food is great and its owned by houstons -lrb- it has the same vibe -rrb- . our only disappointment is the one page menu . they just
3 good italian food for a chain . better than macaroni grille ! the lunch specials are great and the vodka pasta is awesome . a little spendy but hey ! it 's scottsdale . you will see some nice eye candy and sweater meat at the bar .
2 i went to hillstone for the first time tonight . the restaurant is quite striking and in many ways is a homage to frank lloyd wright -- very <unk> in its design . we sat at the bar -- when i got there at 5:30 the wait was a half
3 ca n't wait to have dinner here . met some friends for happy hour . the location is still the wonderful little cottage -- with lots of light and still the rustic paneling in the bar area . i only had a couple of glasses of wine and the french
4 you forget that there is still this level of service and quality of food until you experience again . had dinner here tonite with family . from beginning to end the service and the food was outstanding . i had the chopped salad , salmon and the table shared asparagus
3 we 've been here a number of times . the margarita and bocca trio pizzas are very good . always have a nice crust , fresh toppings , and the wines by the glass are above average . cool and casual atmosphere with good service . will continue to go
3 been here twice and really enjoyed it . i typically like more mellow places that are a little bit more quiet or low key but this is a nice change . mix of young and old , reasonably good list of wines by the glass , the food is pretty
3 actually really good pizzas . we live way closer to the san tan location but i believe they are <unk> . the reviews at this location were better and we were driving by it . the iphone yelp app is always useful . one pizza was sausage , mushroom ,
3 been going here for a few years and always loved it . yelp typically does n't let you down . instead of going to many of the crappy joints downtown before concerts and sporting events we go here . even on the way out to <unk> for a concert .
3 been here twice . very cool place with unique fresh dishes . - they serve a rice liquor that 's a touch <unk> than vodka -lrb- good stuff -rrb- - chee burger -lrb- awesome -rrb- - steamed clams with red miso - <unk> - some sort of pot <unk> dish
3 celebrity is one of the better concert venues in the valley . sometimes the stage revolves and other times they do a 3/4 house show and it does n't . either way , good place to see a show . the bar downstairs is decent , friendly bartenders . dodge
1 over the years i have been here many times . typically the people watching is great , the food is reasonably good , service above average , and so on . however , this time it did n't cut the mustard . a simple thing like a ketel one tonic
3 this place is really cool , but it has a couple problems : 1 -rrb- its right on central and we all know central is one hell of a bitch to drive , that and its hard to find and 2 -rrb- it does n't have as <unk> of a
1 i 'll be honest . i do n't like this place at all . its not that good if you ask me . and not that cheap either . i know there are plenty who like this place , but i think one can do plenty better . when i
3 the chicken and gyro meet are great
4 bbq is one of my favorites and stacy 's is one of the best that i have had in phoenix . i have driven by stacy 's many times and never would have thought to stop in until today when a friend suggested that we meet there for lunch .
3 had a great dinner at flo 's tonight , fried brown rice , <unk> orange chicken , cashew chicken , lettuce wraps , tofu and vegetables and spring rolls . love the contemporary atmosphere .
3 have been here twice , once for lunch and once for dinner . this is a fun restaurant with good food and service . for lunch i had the cheeseburger omelet . this could have been the biggest omelet i have ever had . it was just like a cheeseburger
4 this will be my new lunch time hangout ! the lodge has a nice variety of food . something for everyone . we had potato skins as an appetizer with a terrific cheese dip . for lunch we had a <unk> polish sausage with caramelized onions , taco salad and
4 i have found the one whom my soul loves ! dutch bros ! mmmm . i can thank fellow yelper jen t. for suggesting this gem of a coffee shop to me . their service with a smile , delicious menu of coffees , and constant promotions make me a

4 i have come here twice now and never have i been to a breakfast house that got the orders out quicker ! both times it had to be less than 5 mins and we had our food ! so cool . the food is really good , restaurant decor is
4 yc 's is yummy ! choose whatever you want for meats and veggies , then whatever combination of sauce you want on it , and they wok it up for you ! i always buy a to-go container for 50 cents because it is a small price to pay for
2 tried this place last night based on the reviews ... the atmosphere is charming and feels like you are on vacation somewhere in mexico ... nice getaway for 2 hours for drinks i tried the fresh watermelon , <unk> , and pinapple all were good , especially the watermelon .
3 the juices were fantastic like last time . tostada chips and guac were fantastic . i ordered lamb again ... this time the smell was great and tasted good . the rice with frozen veggies were still wierd considering its an expensive dish . service was also great ... will
4 i 'm really not a huge ice cream or gelato fan but i 've been going here more consistently than anywhere else . they 've got a large selection of delicious and creative flavors with generous serving sizes to choose from . my favorites include anything with cookies , candy
4 beer and spam . let 's goo ! i wanted to go here for a while and happened to walk in with some friends , not knowing the name . i looked at all of the different beers , the cool patio and interesting menu . finally someone told me
3 this is my go-to place for quick breakfast burritos . i either get the standard with eggs , ham , cheese and pico or the machaca with shredded beef , eggs , and cheese . both come with sides of red or green sauce . the tortillas have a nice
3 a delightful <unk> spot at the north end of scottsdale road . the menu is creative without leaving out good `` fundamental dishes . '' the staff is friendly and the patio is really nice when the weather is good . coming in , you 'll be served bottled water
4 i enjoyed everything about squid ink . the decor was unique , the staff was very kind and the menu full of choices . i ordered the daily special , fire breathing dragon , and one of the sushi dinners . it came with a sample of many of their
4 thank you so much nader for telling me about this great place . as i mentioned in my pie hole review i have a list of foods i wanted to find so i could be happy living down town . udon was second on that list behind pie . i
4 i was blown away by the ahi burger . as a <unk> -lrb- fish , veggies , bacon -rrb- i did n't think i would find anything here to eat . when i saw the ahi on the menu i decided to give it a try . it was perfectly
3 i am an absolute fan of trader joe 's ! i could literally <unk> their fantastic qualities for hours , but for the sake of anyone reading this , i will keep it short and sweet . their prices are cheap -lrb- but are definitely not a reflection of the
2 my friends are gon na kill me for rating the lodge anything less than a 5 , because it is consistently one of our group 's favorite go-to 's for happy hour , weekend <unk> , and weekend late night bar fun . however , this place does not rank
3 i am a fan of every fox concepts restaurant that i have had the pleasure of visiting , but culinary <unk> is one of my favorites !! i love the cool ambiance -lrb- plush overstuffed chairs , purple walls , massive <unk> -rrb- , and the patio area is seriously
4 this place is absolutely fabulous , for many reasons . first and foremost , the food . i ordered two large pizzas to go -lrb- cheese and vegetarian -rrb- . both were absolutely delicious ! the crust is thin and light , the cheese melts in your mouth , the

4 after exploring other options , we returned to timo to find a much more organized , efficient experience . the weather was perfect for outdoor dining , so the hubby and i decided to give timo another try . we were seated next to the fire pit and approached immediately
4 my sister lives in austin where food trucks are on almost every corner , so when i heard the trucks were coming to phoenix , i was super psyched !! my co workers and i headed down on friday around 1pm . the trucks are parked close to my school
4 the one thing most ohio girls love is a dive bar , and patties is one of the best dive bars i have ever been to . the service is excellent ; the drinks are strong , and the bartenders are quick . there is so much to do at
2 this place it hit or miss for me . i have always ordered the feta gyro and either fries or a small greek salad . why is the soda machine always broken ? makes me wonder what else is broken and not fixed in the kitchen . i ate here
0 i give this place one star , begrudgingly . the only good thing about this place was the ambiance and the service at the bar . i am <unk> by the service we had at the table . i have never been treated so badly . we had a party
3 so much better than pizzaria bianco ! the food is excellent , as is the service and price . my hubby and i always go when we have friends or family in from out of town . do n't leave without trying the bruschetta . the pizza is flavorful and
3 wow we just visited this cute little place . very nice and cute little bundt cakes , we were looking for some cupcakes for a friend , but thought these might be better for a change . very cute little shop with helpful people working there . we had the
1 i remember when it opened and i was at asu and living in tempe and it was the big thing in town . i remember everyone going on about the damn <unk> cafe and how cool it was , then i checked it out and it sucked hard . i
2 finally go to check this place out . town and country is certainly in a revival , and it only took about 10 years of <unk> and doom first . anyways , friday night , actually got a table right away . service spotty , forgot a fork , forgot
3 very good !! eaten lunch here a few times . bbq chicken special . very fast and delicious . have n't had dinner here , the bus person was not too friendly but hey , do n't like your job , then back to school for you no ? i
4 finally got to that side of town . this review is based on the ice cream only and not the service which was adequate but certainly not 5 stars worthy , just average service and average ambiance . but the ice cream is some of the best i have had
3 had to go into scottsdale yet again , this time to the quaint scottsdale mall . well went there for a reason , after seeing jewel of the crown on pbs `` check please '' , i was hungry for some indian food . monday night : not busy a
3 good to see yogurtology in town & country . i think t & c is showing <unk> of life with the new series of stores that recently opened up . this used to be a short lived coffee plantation before this incarnation . but enough of the az history lesson
4 ok and thank you david l for your great review of federal pizza . i had no idea that this place was even on the <unk> . after reading david 's illustrious review , we headed on down for a nice sunday dinner . busy , and slightly difficult parking
2 good , cool atmosphere . but the <unk> have this kind of arrogant , look at us , we are a cool place in the barrio attitude . and go later , or wait a long time . but kind of a funky place . the food is hot ,
3 finally got around to going . made reservation in the past but had to cancel . reservation for 2 , last sat night , 8:45 -lrb- like late night eating on weekend 's ! -rrb- . not that busy , most likely missed the sat night rush . parking was
2 great fish and chips and good pints . much better now that it is non-smoking . for a minute you almost feel like downtown phoenix actually has some culture like a real city . but then you step out of the pub and realize that phoenix has no charm and

3 good steak , very nice ambiance and very professional . the steak similar to ruth <unk> 's comes sizzling in hot butter . however , the sides were bland and uninspired . go to <unk> 's instead or ruth chris . total cost $ 200 with tip and several drinks
3 happened to stop by yesterday . it reminded me of panera bread bakery in oregon . we bought a sourdough loaf and two pastries to go . very nice , lemon bar was great and raspberry cream cheese danish was also very good . i think they have free wi-fi
2 i was let down by yelp . as someone that travels to new cities non-stop and is always trying new 4.5 + yelp reviews this place is a definite miss . the salad starter was outstanding and i was expecting the same . the venison was requested medium rare and
3 i had the filet and it was enjoyable . i would have been disappointed if it came with a $ 50 price tag from a fancy steakhouse but for the price it was good . menu was basic and i struggled to find something that sounded really good to eat
3 what to add that has n't been said in the past <unk> reviews of this tempe favorite brewery ? not much , to be honest : no other beer is served besides what is brewed at the location . asking for a <unk> peaks beer will most likely be met
3 the ol' d and d . a quiet and lovely sandwich <unk> in an otherwise boring shopping ce of central phoenix . each time i come here after work it is slow and the service is excellent . the bar is usually staffed by older employees while the sandwich counter
3 we decided to try a different pita jungle that we hardly ever go to . we waited to be seated and we arrived before another bigger group but was seated after them . she came out and <unk> that there were 2 of us but there was 6 of us

3 dim sum mmm mmm good ! my wife and i had to pretty much roll out of there ... we ate way too much ! the biggest problem was that you keep ordering more and more as the carts roll by . we 've been back a few times for

4 my sister-in-law 's mom forces her and my brother to take her to knock <unk> lobster every time she comes into town from baltimore . we met up with them . 2 piece fish and shrimp <unk> . they even have pasta for the vegetarians ! the mizithra cheese pasta
4 wow ! our friend , who we took to another italian food restaurant the night before and was horrible , showed us up ! my wife and her friend got the `` homemade ravioli alla <unk> '' ... wow ! -lrb- nothing more needs to be said -rrb- veal parmigiana
2 the food was ok ... was n't very special . my wife asked for `` thai hot '' ... got maybe a medium . i asked for `` medium spice '' and got hot . the service is still horrible . i moved out of state for 2 years and
4 still the best bbq in town !! the pulled pork and beef brisket were great ! i 'm not quite sure why they have <unk> there ... completely unnecessary ! the bbq sauces are freshly made and heated .

3 i should n't give this away because i hurt my chances to get a good table , but i 'm a good person and not too selfish so i 'll let you in on the best happy hour in town . you can get wine for $ 5 and hold
4 flemings must have the best service in this town ! we came in early for hh . kris <unk> over with a huge welcoming smile to get us seated and comfortable on the spacious patio . next , he introduced us to our waiter doug ray . even though it
3 when the kids come to visit they always have a list of restaurants they want to check out . we struck out for a late dinner and this location is close to my house . we walked in and liked the feel of the restaurant . church pews for seats
3 i often drive by this deli on my way to work and never stopped in . since i was craving a good deli sandwich since last week today was the day . the restaurant itself is nothing special so i was hoping the food was . i <unk> at the
3 tried this place after getting a groupon . i was very pleasantly surprised . the location is not the best , but what was lacking in appearance , certainly made up for it with the food that was served . the decor inside of the restaurant is very well put
3 great atmosphere and great food . i ate dessert after eating at what was once open , trader vics . the dessert here was great . i had the special , the chocolate <unk> pie . this was a very good choice . i will come back here for dinner
1 i had high hopes for this restaurant . however , they ended once i was greeted at the door by a very unfriendly hostess . i had a reservation and had made it over a week in advance . well , we arrive 10 minutes prior and are seated at
4 this has become my favorite restaurant in scottsdale for a nice dinner out . the menu was very unique and they serve generous portions , unlike most of the scottsdale restaurants . to start , our party had 5 people and we had reservations on a saturday night . we
2 smells amazing . bacon donuts ... ca n't wait .
3 i really think this place is so cute . we went there today to support small business saturday . good food , quaint atmosphere , nice staff . we will defiantly go there again .
1 i do n't get it . to be fair , i 've only had their pizza , while <unk> , i would never go back . its definitely a huge jump up from the domino 's & pizza <unk> but not even close to a spinato 's pizza -lrb- my

1 had the chicken , potato and rosemary pizza , it was kind of bland . friend had the spaghetti and meatballs and said it was nothing spectacular . pizookie -lrb- do n't know what they call it here but its a cookie pizza -rrb- was the best part . we
2 huge airport . not as modern or clean as lax or <unk> , but good nonetheless . lots of little gift shops inside for tourists to buy knick knacks but my suggestion would be to pass through security first because the stores on the `` inside '' have better stock
2 3.5 stars . it 's ironic that the name of the restaurant is `` pure sushi '' because in my opinion , this place is good if you are into fusion rolls ... they are very creative . ambiance is nice , decor is trendy , but prices are a
4 lots of yogurt flavors ! lots of toppings ... they even had lychee ! i was impressed . not too impressed that my roomie and i got there at the same time as a huge sorority but i guess thats expected given the location .
3 this was our last stop for the night . no cover , good music , good crowd . i 've never seen so many hot boys in one spot . maybe it was just a good night ? or maybe its like this every night ? either way there were
4 i love this place ! lots of good , healthy food options . prices are n't bad . everyone that works here is super nice . go check it out !
3 add me to the growing list of fans ... this is an awesome place ; another well thought out sam fox concept . the turkey pastrami on a pretzel roll is one of the better sandwiches i 've ever had . lunch is a bit pricey ; but perfect for
4 i have dreams about the mozzarella on the caprese style sandwich . seriously . and the soppressata is the perfect compliment ... if you 're coming as a <unk> order both and share . yum .
4 i 'm completely impressed by the mission and i ca n't wait to go back and try more of their amazing food . my husband and i chose the mission for our 8th anniversary dinner and had a wonderful time - the staff is extraordinarily knowledgeable and very warm &
4 come on now , folks ... one star reviews and complaints about the wait ? you have heard of pizzeria bianco before , right <unk> fresh , local ingredients , a chef who cares more about his craft than arguably anyone in town and a great location - that 's
3 pretty dang good ! i tried the barbacoa , pibil and queso fundido tacos and all were great . the barbacoa was my fave , it had incredible depth of flavor and was extremely tender . my husband preferred the queso fundido ; perfectly salty & meaty . : -rrb-
1 stopped by for lunch for the first time at this attractive restaurant in the biltmore fashion park with high expectations . the <unk> are beautiful , inviting and classy and the menu looked interesting . the disinterested server did not make a good first impression . we ordered a couple
3 great family atmosphere and the food is good , too ! from the chips and salsa to tasty fajitas , delicious crispy tacos to just plain old rice and <unk> was fresh and hot when it got to the table . we went on a busy friday night and were
4 we moved to the area recently and have planned to visit mijana many times , but only made it out tonight . we arrived just after they opened for dinner , so it was pretty empty except for a birthday party by the stage area . the waitress was attentive
3 i went to liberty market for the first time last friday to hang out with friends at the latest #evfn . i have to say i was very impressed with the place and the staff . they took excellent care of a very large crowd . since i was n't
2 in my opinion trader joe 's is only good for hummus -lrb- their store brand hummus is better than any other hummus i 've ever bought at any grocery store -rrb- and their frozen food section -lrb- because they carry a lot of stuff other grocery stores do n't carry
3 i did n't think i would like this place , because i had the idea in my head that paying for ramen at a restaurant was a waste of money . i mean , you can buy a packet of ramen for $ <unk> and make it yourself at home
3 came here for dim sum this past weekend and i was impressed . they have all the usual dim sum favorites and some that i 've never seen at dim sum before -lrb- e.g. soup dumplings -rrb- . came with a group of 12 people and our bill came out
1 went to los olivos for the first time today to get my car washed . i usually just do it myself at the self service places , but i had gone on a few road trips with my dog and she left a lot of hair in the back seat
2 this place is good , but it 's not good enough to make me recommend it over the other better restaurants out there . when a restaurant has prices for food like they do , i expect to enjoy everything i eat . unfortunately , that 's not the case
3 the duce is a really unique place to hang out with friends . they have an eclectic mix of attractions like a boxing ring , random vintage exercise equipment , a dj station , drink carts , a milkshake counter . i came here in december for brunch and it
2 i 'm not sure who <unk> who , but 5th and wine 's bruschetta appetizer is pretty much exactly the same as postino 's bruschetta ... but not as good . 5th and wine has fewer options to select from for toppings and their bruschetta costs more for less food
0 i wo n't be coming here anymore . the food does n't make up for the <unk> service . i called about a week and a half ago to make a reservation for 10 people on their patio . the girl who answered the phone took down my information but
1 so -- i still have n't had the pizza here . i guess i 'm just not a pizza person . but the more i think about it , i think it is fair to judge them on their <unk> food , because even if it is n't their specialty
3 checked out the phoenix art museum 's <unk> world music and food event on sunday . it was a great way to spend a beautiful sunday afternoon . the music was good and there was great food sampling from several restaurants - breadfruit , india palace , cafe lalibela ,
3 needed a fix and had n't had a sacks sandwich in a few months . it was delish and reminded me why i love their food . today , i had a simple chicken salad sandwich with lettuce , cucumbers and provolone . of course , i had to get
1 it 's not awful but it 's not bad either . it 's one of those places where the food and drink menu are both sooooooo long that they kitchen and bar probably have a tough time turning out good stuff <unk> . i do like the spinach dip ,
3 happy hour includes $ 5 appetizers and discount on wines by the glass . try to pork empanada -lrb- little piece of heaven -rrb- and the chicken phyllo pockets .
1 may be i went on a bad day for the kitchen , but the dishes i had was well below the average touristy level . - the salsa that came with the chips tasted generic and canned - the menudo was a quarter chunk of a potato , half of
2 i thought that i would really like the pizza here a lot more . previously enjoyed it as take-out at a friend 's place . however , my sausage pizza was way too soggy , in fact it was down right wet in the middle .
2 my pastabar experience was pretty much on par with current yelp 3-star rating ... once again yelp is spot on i thought service was great . but the atmosphere was just felt awkward . the combo of extra loud music with odd selection of the occasional heavy metal pieces and
3 do n't get me wrong , i love trader joe 's . i do all of my shopping there with the exception of sliced cheese , <unk> , and amy 's meals . i just do n't love this tj 's . this is the smallest tj 's i 've
4 yeah , i 'm updating my review . so what if i 'm the <unk> -lrb- the cynical new yorker -rrb- to thomas 's shirley -lrb- the <unk> <unk> -rrb- ? what are you going to do about it ? i love fez for reasons other than thomas . and
1 i should have known that an italian restaurant with a french name would be bad news . its just the start of the identity crisis going on ... i do n't really get what they 're trying to do here . are they aiming to be an upscale restaurant ?
2 so i gave portland 's another shot this past weekend , given their $ 30 summer prix fixe menu and its proximity to my new place . like melissa h said there was a change in the pf menu and the fish i was going to get was replaced with
2 i was n't sure what to expect after reading the reviews here ... while i would n't say it 's in the basement i do get the whole car fumes thing . however , we were sitting fairly far back and did n't have any issues with it . the
2 i 'm going to be real here , i 'm unimpressed by this place . first of all , it is not hawaiian . let 's just get that out of the way now . half of the menu consists of tacos ! wasabi is a common ingredient . the
2 i have to say that i like the scottsdale location much more . the hostess brought us in right away and got us a table where we could watch the game . the food was just as good as the scottsdale location and our waitress was very nice but they
3 noble beast is great because they carry the frou frou organic dog food -lrb- <unk> -rrb- that we feed our puppy . i never thought i 'd be one of those people that gives their dog organic food ... never did i think i would find myself on a website
3 what a great alternative to campus eateries . essence cafe reminds me of the type of little lunch cafe i would go to in boston . it has a small dining room as well as a small patio that would be very nice on a warm day . i met
2 when stevey p asked me if i wanted to go to the first game at camelback ranch i jumped at the chance . its been a long winter and i need some baseball ! the stadium itself is beautiful , the natural rock walls give it a very `` arizona
4 jackpot . i was soooo nervous about finding good pizza in az . . in boston the choices were pretty atrocious and i was expecting to have to go on a hunt for a good slice out here . pulling up to redendo 's was <unk> . the <unk> logo
3 i like maizie 's ... i like it a lot . i think that for what it is its a good addition to the area . i met melissa h. , christine o. and melissa h. for happy hour today and i was quite pleased . their specials , which
3 my parents stopped by campus when they arrived in phoenix to take me out for lunch . their flight was a little delayed so that put us in a little bit of a time crunch as i had a little over an hour to eat and get to class .
4 my hubby found this place on yelp when he searched for `` burgers and beer , '' our two favorite things . when he looked on hopdoddy 's website and found out they were from texas , he was really interested in trying it . i remember seeing this place
2 although my hubby would award it 2.25 stars , i am not as harsh . i loved my belgian wit . it was like four peaks peach ale minus the peach . very refreshing ! we got potato nachos and they were different because they were cooked in their brick
1 i would have given this place one star , but the free cookie deserved an extra star . the snickerdoodles are chewy and delicious . as for the rest of the food , it was not worth the money or the calories . we saw this place on an old
2 definitely a cooler dive bar that i 've been to . the place is dark but has a lot of seating . we got free tickets to see the main band , otherwise the cover would have been $ 10 , which is somewhat expensive considering the bands were ok
3 very cool venue for live music , mainly because it 's small and you can easily interact with the artists . there 's also seating , so if you get there early enough , you can get a seat . the pricing seems like it varies depending on who <unk>
4 this place is pretty awesome for a desert region in arizona . i came to glendale to visit a friend from college and he took me to this huge outdoor strip mall . it 's friggin hot and dry to no end around phoenix , so i thought it was
3 great food and great service ! -lrb- minus the snotty moody hostess that we first saw when arriving -rrb- . our server was very helpful and accommodating , even walking us over to kazimierz afterwards . we were stuffed and very happy with the food we had : chopped salad
3 i visited lon 's last night for restaurant week with kristin s . if you do n't know where you are going , it is definitely a tricky place to find . it does add to the appeal because it gives the feeling of <unk> which would be appreciated if
2 my co-workers and i checked out barrio cafe on a whim . we almost drove right by it the first time , as it is nestled in a row of shops on 16th street just before thomas . there is a very very small parking lot in the back ,
2 my husband and i decided to finally check out pastabar on saturday night . we wanted to love this place , but in the end left feeling very underwhelmed by the food . the space is really cool with just enough art and pictures on the wall to give it
3 lemon pepper is back ! i do n't know when it got <unk> on the menu , but this seriously made my day . just for that , i am bumping this pei wei up to 4 stars . quick service even when the line is out the door ;

2 i have really mixed emotions about sack 's . on one hand , the baguette bread is soft and chewy ; the sandwiches are creative -lrb- my coworkers both really like the jazz and the gothic -rrb- ; if you do n't see a sandwich on the menu you want

3 i dig hanny 's . it 's a great addition to the downtown phoenix scene , both for during the day and at night . there is plenty of parking around hanny 's , albeit at meters , but if you go at night the meters turn off at 8
2 my husband and i checked out flemings for happy hour on friday night before going to see `` book of <unk> '' . it was pretty busy that evening -lrb- the line was out the door when we left at 7:30 -rrb- , but our service at the bar was
2 i do n't eat red meat so don and charlie 's is n't a place i would normally find myself going to . i went friday night for a friend 's surprise 30th birthday dinner with a group of about 15 . our table was set up and waiting once
4 another place that is really serene and makes you forget you are in a large city ! i really liked the desert botanical gardens and i am totally not into flowers or <unk> ! we had been to dbg once before for luminarias , but it was so dark that
4 the search is over ... i have found my favorite wine bar in the valley ! comfortably situated on central avenue slightly south of mcdowell , it 's a quiet , chic space that i think will be tremendously helped out once light rail opens in a few months .
3 the first time i tried spinato 's pizza was when my friend introduced me to it with carryout over the summer . we went with the thin crust pizza and i really enjoyed it . the next time i was in town i stopped in and tried the restaurant itself

2 i 've been shopping at costco for years , and it 's probably one of my favorite places to go . they have a little bit of everything , and i can usually find what i need here . but , this location itself seems to make me sad and
3 i have eaten here before on several occasions , but its been a while since i dined in at <unk> . i like it here , though its typical chinese food . lovely menu , cool decor , service was okay . i would come here again . i split

3 look , i love target as much as the next person , and this store is no exception . it 's huge , clean , well stocked and is close to my home . it 's located in the christown mall , and i shop here from time to time
4 the good egg is good for a lot of things , and thats why i dine here . i usually frequent here for breakfast , but they do carry a full menu of breakfast , lunch and dinner items on their menu . i like this place for a variety
1 this is an asian mall that has quite a few asian stores and restaurants in it along with a few other businesses as well . the place is always packed , and the grocery store in here seems to have a big draw to it . every time i 'm

4 after reading about this place here on yelp , i decided it was time to wander into this marvelous establishment once and for all , and check it out . i was in the market to purchase a book , and thought why not wander in here to see if

3 ok , so i finally found this place ! tucked away in a little strip mall across from some car <unk> , its a great little find . i noticed that they have great hours here , open early and late at night as well . the seating here is

4 well i have to say i was very impressed with this establishment . well run , nice staff , great new york style pizza . very good quality ingredients and very tasty <unk> . all their pizzas come in your choice of three different sauce styles -lrb- regular , white
4 this is another one of those `` we need to eat so lets see what yelp recommends in the area '' finds . it was a good thing we had directions because this place is kind of hard to find , its not very well marked or visible from the
4 this place reminds me a lot of the vig , modern atmosphere with good looking people inside . the parking to my <unk> was plentiful and easy to get in and out even though the place was packed . as this is within walking distance , i will deem it
4 the best bread stick i 've ever had . so good i ordered an extra to go . it 's refreshing to be able to get new cuisine and breadfruit fits the bill . my other favorite part was the byob , however do n't listen to the server that
4 as unassuming as the hippie decorations are , the $ 5 value meal as i would describe it is well worth it . the only complaint i had in going here was the seating , and i could see how it could be a <unk> when it 's either hot
4 loved it !!! we went there last friday night to be romantic and it definitely did the trick . i had never experienced a byob restaurant before and after experiencing it first hand i am hooked . we started the evening with the fillet mignon tacos and they were fabulous
4 i love this place . my husband and i decided to spend a night downtown to celebrate our first year of <unk> bliss . we booked a king suite poolside and the room was much more than we could ever imagine . the decor is right up my alley -
2 last night was my first time at majerle 's and it will probably be my last . it is just your typical sports bar , nothing special .
4 yum ! if you are in the mood for a good , juicy burger exactly the way you like it - cheeburger cheeburger is the place for you . everything is build your own - burgers , shakes , and chicken sandwiches . my husband was a bit more adventurous
3 the brunch place of mill ncounter is a cute place with exceptional food the menu is very healthy , which sort of makes it stick out from the other mill avenue breakfast/lunch options on my last visit i got the breakfast special which was biscuits & gravy i love biscuits
4 my favorite is the mojo cookie monster i toss on a bunch of <unk> , chocolate syrup , <unk> , peanut butter cups , and gummy bears soooooo good !
2 scramble has a really cute layout and color scheme like all the other breakfast joints : very clean and hip i had the impression that it was a sit down restaurant but it 's an order and seat yourself sort of deal ... it got a little bit packed and
4 <unk> is a great place for celebratory dinners and such and it is n't cheap but in my opinion it is very much worth every penny the view is breathtaking and i love the floor to ceiling windows the <unk> are very professional , friendly , and not over <unk>
3 bookmark day in the area and wanted to try some place new the stand was a joint that we had passed several times upon walking in , it is small and i felt like it had almost a `` beach '' feel ... the inside is very nice and clean
4 my friends were boasting about this place and so i threw it on my bookmark list . today i had the pleasure to stop in for some breakfast and i was very delighted ! i got the california club sammich which was divine i also had a caramel latte and
3 love the zoo . we had a season pass and went whenever the weather was good -lrb- not too hot -rrb- the best part of the zoo , in my opinion , is the <unk> monkey exhibit . you get to walk thru with all the little <unk> hanging around
2 my employer had their company christmas party here this past friday . let 's start with the only downside to having the party here , the food . while it is hard to complain about free food , i will . it was a buffet with nothing good going for
3 went back to over easy yesterday for breakfast and it was just as good as i remembered . the line was n't very long as it was almost noon on a saturday which i guess was more brunch but whatever i just woke up lol . so i got my
1 after hearing about this place for a few years i was really excited to finally try it out . unfortunately i was very disappointed with the quality of the food . i had the bacon cheeseburger i know i know you are thinking how can you mess up a cheeseburger
3 went today with a friend and we had a great lunch . we started with the edamame and ordered 3 rolls . the first to arrive was the shrimp and soy paper roll . it was very good it had big pieces of shrimp with some crab and asparagus in
3 so i walked into upper crust and then totally felt like i was transported to patsy grimaldi 's . the decor , the glasses , the tablecloths i mean everything was identical . i love grimaldi 's so i guess this is n't a bad thing for me . so
3 popped in for the $ 5 wine and tasty bruschetta . as always was amazing . the wine was a chardonnay from washington called <unk> and it was very good . being from washington i was surprised i had never tried it before but i 'm glad i know about

4 my favorite pizza place in az . . i got my usual sun dried tomato and cheese pizza . as always it was great . they cook your pizza in a brick oven with coal so you get a nice smoky flavor on the crust . this place is amazing
3 today for lunch my buddy asked if i wanted to go to joey 's and i actually thought an italian beef sounded good so i went along to try this place out . after having real italian beef from portillo 's in chicago and their location in california i was

4 this is a little treasure chest of people , service , food and sports . totally unpretentious in a converted old property of south scottsdale . it could probably use a facelift , but who cares . it has very little atmosphere , but again , who cares . it
2 the pizza was delicious , no doubt . i loved that the pizzas were made with organic ingredients and made to order . i had the chicken , spinach , ricotta , white pizza . the greek salad was perfectly seasoned and tasty . the server was also knowledgeable and
3 the only reason they do n't get 5 stars is the wait is just too long on most weekends and their front of house staff does n't seem johnny on the spot all the time . the food is always great . we 've had the fried <unk> is rockin
3 first off i am a huge fan of refried beans , this place has some of the most velvety , delicious refried beans i 've ever had anywhere . not too salty , homemade , creamy , just perfect . i am a fan of their pastor . before eating

3 first thing 's first . the beer selection is great , both the bottles and the tap collection . the bar gets 4 stars for the beer selection alone . food : not so good . belgian pizza is actually good , other than the pizzas the food is bogus
2 i had high hopes coming here , but i just have never left feeling satisfied . not a terrible place to eat , but nothing memorable . kind of bland .
3 i 'll make this short . i was craving a gyro , and the one i got at pita jungle definitely hit the spot . it was delicious , a good size , and decently priced . also , the workers are very friendly which is always a plus .
2 i like this mall , but wow , this mall hates babies . well babies in strollers ... i also wonder how people in <unk> feel about this mall . let me tell you why ... it 's all the annoying elevators !! omg why do i have to take
3 food is n't the best , but it 's decent . games are fun especially basketball . and the watermelon margaritas are delicious ! i used to go to d & b back home in the bay area to have a drunken good time with friends and i used to
3 i love the drive-in . 2 movies for $ 6.50 and i can bring my infant without worrying about him getting fussy and disturbing others during the movie makes me a happy girl . the building is a bit outdated , and the bathrooms are a little dirty , but
4 we recently went shopping and of course our kids belong to their kids club . our daughter could n't decide on her organic apple . well the nice gentleman stocking the apple section offered to let her daughter sample an apple . he gladly cut up a super cold pink
3 we normally hit ra sushi for <unk> <unk> hour , but not today ! do n't tell the kids ! we were greeted quickly and seated at our booth . kat was our server and she was very attentive and extremely polite . we thoroughly enjoyed our meal . we

3 we have been waiting to try sushi eye for a while . we decided to celebrate the day and stopped for sushi ! the parking lot is always full ! the decor was nice , light green and black , roomy tables and a bar that circled inside and outside
4 the strawberry , az waffles are a favorite , and can be <unk> by making it a `` combo '' with an egg and bacon , ham , or sausage . bright colors and free wifi make this a cheery place to visit . takeout , or counter service delivered
4 gold bar espresso is a cozy , locally owned and operated coffee spot . its prior location in a retired bank vault -lrb- hence the name -rrb- was <unk> much more charming than its current <unk> strip mall locale , but it makes up for it with friendly and helpful
4 chino bandido is a staple . the jade chicken and emerald chicken are particularly excellent . ordering by filling out a form is optional at this <unk> chandler location -lrb- whereas required at the busier phoenix location -rrb- , but is a key piece of the experience . snickerdoodle cookies
4 always great service , lovely ambience , great wine selection , and appies that ca n't be beat . the bruschetta is delicious , the meat platter is divine , and the cheese plate delights my palate . our party of 10 had a very enjoyable evening here with extremely
2 the vine continues to be a local hang-out for a few choice beers , some wings , and a burger . the food is good enough , but the service is incredibly better . i do appreciate that you 're listening to your customers . we 'll continue to visit
3 great sunday morning service and lots of tv 's in this chargers fan fave bar . clean , friendly , and great bar specials . breakfast flatbread to die for . . do not miss this . everything on the menu was actually very tasty except for the chicken fried
3 the sushi here is amazingly delicious , super fresh , and there are a wide variety of choices . miso soup is also quite nice as are the gyoza dumplings . this small -lrb- ish -rrb- place was hopping on a friday night and we were happy to have reservations
1 second time to bld and so disappointed . the short rib breakfast burrito was dry and tasteless , and the avacodo was missing in action ! my friend 's chicken fried steak was greasy and <unk> and tough . she could barely cut her steak and the potatoes were cold
4 i love bbq and rudy 's - you have my number . every single time i visit , the place is studded with men on their lunch breaks . i 'm not complaining here , but this girl loves your food too ! my favorite is your moist brisket done
3 this was the best lunch i have ever had at yupha 's . great service , delicious smoky fried rice with delicate tofu , crispy orange chicken and soup & salad . good prices and quick lunchtime <unk> . you can order your food as mild or spicy as you
2 i realize this locale is at the airport , so i 'll be gracious . but friends , this ai n't the barrio caf you 'll find downtown . the food is really terrific for airport food , the service is mediocre , but it 's still the airport .
1 i recently cleaned out my closet , picked a bunch of items that i thought would do well at buffalo and took them in to see what type of credit i would get . the young man took my box of clothing , went through them all without saying a
3 i 've never been a huge fan of chinese food and i 'm still not one who would really consider chinese food or take-out , but despite this , pei wei has won me over . our typical order is kung pao chicken , mongolian beef , fried rice and
4 discount tire is an example of how well a business can be run if you provide great service and treat your customers fairly . i noticed one of the tires was low on my wife 's suv as i was about to drive up to the white mountains for the
1 had some friends visiting from nyc this past weekend and they were staying at the phoenician , so we headed over to catch up and let our kids play together . unfortunately , i , and they , were extremely disappointed by the poor service at the resort . firstly
3 wow - good cheap basic pizza ! my wife and i stopped yesterday for the $ 4 , two slices and a soda special . we both had pepperoni and it was extremely tasty and filling . i 'll definitely be back and if i worked nearby , i 'd
3 why go to some new place that tries to recreate the ambiance of an old fashioned ice cream parlor when you can just go to an actual old-fashioned ice cream parlor ? unlike newer parlors , mary coyle 's does n't try to be <unk> hip or ironic , they
4 <unk> bentley 's whiskey row is the latest and newest place to open in old town scottsdale . it 's basically a sports bar / nightclub with a country music theme . like most entertainment establishments in scottsdale the servers are exclusively very attractive females and at whiskey row they
2 after spending the afternoon fighting with the boa i needed a break . i ventured into sahara middle eastern resturant , i 've read the <unk> praise and was hopeful . what i was met with was a nicely decorated small cozy resturant with middle eastern music in the background
2 when i first moved into my place in tempe , i took a good look around the neighborhood and i saw a thai place , a coffee shop of death , a decent <unk> , ted 's hot dogs and sakebomber sushi & grill . i thought i was set
4 <unk> !! that 's some damned good fried chicken ! hahaha !! <unk> for real though ... ugh ... * insert homer <unk> <unk> sound here ! * my cousin and i were spent the weekend being <unk> and i got tired of it and offered her some lolo 's

3 i have traveled across the internet to sing the praises of a certain thai restaurant . through a semester and a half of research with one of my favorite asu professors , we had dined at yupha 's thai kitchen once . it was incredible ! one of the best
3 here is my question ... why are the <unk> so hard to come by at houstons ? its a game now ... i called today ... -lrb- both phx and sd -rrb- to see if either location had my favorite app in this entire world ... nothing ... at either
1 pei ... have you lost your wei ? not sure what was going on last night ... working late , so called over to `` my '' pei wei to grab a pei wei spicy chicken with brown rice and salad rolls ... well , they have the chicken ,
3 the w is definitely one of the more ` hip ' hotels in old town , if you are looking for a more lively vibe , as opposed to relaxing , this is probably where you should stay . i have to say all staff i have ever encountered here
3 they have a great sunday buffet ! $ 17 dollars gets you all you can eat plus bottomless mimosas ! our server was outstanding ! plates were cleared right away so we could make room for more , and the second our glasses <unk> the <unk> a new sparkling mimosa
3 i am not a breakfast nut like my gal <unk> , but when i am feeling hungry after a long night out there is nothing like some greasy wholesome breakfast food ! what sets breakfast club -lrb- bc -rrb- apart is the younger crowd and the lively vibe , and
3 coincidentally i came here on the 13th of august and they have awesome specials on the 13th -lrb- due to name 13 north -rrb- ... i think the special was : buy any glass of wine and get one for 13 cents -lrb- or something similar to that -rrb- .
3 aside from the fact that the signage driving around this airport is <unk> and for the most part <unk> sucky , this airport has grown on me . there are lots of places to eat , with a good variety . you can make it from one side to the
2 the good : - it is better than zipps -lrb- owner of the chain - goldie 's is the original -rrb- - the wings ! - and the golden sauce - the <unk> - very <unk> , sports bar - the patrons -lrb- usually very nice in that cheers kind
4 plate 1 : chocolate donut , strawberries , blue berries , <unk> , pineapple , orange , grapefruit , 2 pork egg rolls , a maple bar and a <unk> yogurt . plate 2 : steak , sausage , bacon and icecream . beverages : water , orange juice ,
3 warning , there are usually drunk people here ... and 30 minutes after i get here , i am usually one of them . i love sunday <unk> on the patio at dos ; always a great friendly vibe from the patrons and staff . do drink the frozen margarita
0 i went to cadillac ranch on wednesday <unk> with 3 friends . the reason we chose cr tempe was because they have a great patio overlooking a stage at tempe marketplace where the winner of `` the voice '' would be singing that night . we were told it was
4 i am so glad i went to tapas papa frita for happy hour last friday ! they have 2 dollar tapas -lrb- the crab salad tapa was amazing - i ordered two -rrb- and 2 dollars glasses of white or red sangria - the white was definitely more of my
3 for a concert arena it was really big and i liked it . afterwards it got very crowded and i felt a bit uncomfortable . overall - nice place .
4 i went to salt river 3 times this year for spring training games ! each was a blast since i am a huge baseball fan ! i was pleasantly surprised that they had such a variety of food and drinks -lrb- jack daniels , sangria , mike 's hard lemonade
1 this place is not the business . the only good thing about these sandwiches is they are hangover <unk> tools . i gave a drunk girl $ 20 and she returned to the apartment with a brown bag filled with these damn cheese steaks . i thought they were not
3 the hash browns or whatever the hell it was , were like cubed french fries . i liked them . the food was good . there was a slice of an orange on my plate . i thought it was a garnish of some sort or was to be used
4 my boyfriend and i stopped in for lunch today before taking our boys to the water park . rocket burger is one of our favorite places to stop in to eat or just grab a couple of the many bottle sodas they sell . upon walking in we immediately noticed
3 i love olive garden , i love their salad & bread sticks . my boyfriend took me here on one of our 1st dates years ago & it became a place we eat at frequently . we both love the chicken alfredo & the fresh grated parmesan cheese they top
2 my boyfriend and i came to district one night when we were staying at the sheraton . let me start off by saying that we were on <unk> , so all of the food was half off ... which i believe made a huge difference in our experience . the
4 my boyfriend and i went on a date here a while back and it was nothing short of perfect . we sat on the back patio and had pizza & wine -- both were fabulous . the waitress was really sweet , and the place surprisingly had a lot of
4 i love this place !! <unk> is everything a coffeehouse should be . friendly staff , great coffee , and from what i saw , yummy eats . this is a great place to just sit and have a drink , or come to get some work done while you
3 maizie 's is so good !! especially on monday nights when they have $ 5 burgers . their sweet potato fries are the best i 've ever had , and their service is always great . the setting is comfy and casual , and with indoor and outdoor seating it
1 my biggest gripe is the value and variety . the two v 's , very important . the sandwiches are <unk> dollars but do n't come with anything . and all they have are salad and chips . also , the sandwiches are n't that big . tasty enough ,
2 upgraded 1 star . i think they made the sandwiches a little larger , plus i figured out that you just need to get yourself a side salad since they do n't give you a side . still , sandwich , side salad and drink is $ 13 . not
3 nine iron panini was yummy and fresh . the organic chips were n't awesome . will try the side salad next time . but first i will try this ` amazing ' bruschetta everyone raves about . great customer service ! convenient location although if you are traveling north on
3 i love this place and i 'm not even vegan . though , after eating at green , i 'm seriously considering vegetarianism . problem is : i 'm a creature of habit . when i find a meal i like , i just <unk> it over and over .
3 forefathers always seems to be one of those places that i forget about until someone else suggests it . of course , when they do suggest it , i feel like smacking myself in the <unk> ... `` forefathers ! of course ! why did n't i think of that
1 a coworker and i were ignored by the staff and i have n't been back . there were no other customers in the bar , only the bartender and we could see other servers in the back walking around . it 's not like they were busy . after sitting
3 i 've been here twice now and have had great experiences . first of all , the place is super cute ! not sure how a grocery store could really be cute , but it is ! the first time i was there was part of the urban wine walk
3 this was our last stop on the urban wine walk yesterday , and it was a great place to end the day . because this was our last stop , we were too late to get the wine special , however we decided to stay and grab a table on
3 amen & hallelujah ! i finally made it to cibo ! i can finally join the ranks of the other -lrb- almost -rrb- 400 yelpers to post a review ! after hearing so much about it and working downtown for 10 years , it sure has taken me a long
3 i have been trying to get to cheuvront for a while now . what better reason than for restaurant week ? the menu sounded delicious and one of my favorites out of the ones i read . the service was great , the atmosphere was cool , the wine was
2 for those of us that work in the downtown area , this is a good place to stop for a drink after a long day in the office . sitting on the patio was nice . the service was okay . i was excited to try the sliders , but
3 i love summer . not because we become <unk> and have to <unk> during the day . i love summer because i get to drink iced coffee . up until a few months ago , all i knew was that i loved iced coffee , did n't really think about
3 yeah , they just opened a new thai house on shea and 70 street . <unk> -rrb- <unk> it 's is pretty tasty and they have lunch specials too .
2 this is my second time at this location . i must say i really like the one on scottsdale road better . the sushi was okay . it was fresh but there was something missing . i get the same rolls at the other location and the fish just melts
3 the prime rib with irish potatoes is delicious . sadly , i have yet to try the pies . hmmm
1 so , i had the jerk chicken , rice and peas with plantains and cabbage . the rice and peas were the best thing about this place everything was was not good at all . the jerk chicken had no flavor no heat at all and if you had jerk
0 so , i order the `` side fish taco '' for 3 bucks , when it came i was like ok cool they give you a good amount for 3 buck so i asked `` this is the side taco right '' she said `` yes that 's why is
3 finally got a chance to check this place out . for you people like me that like saving money , go to google and type in padre 's phoenix coupon . <unk> has a buy one get one free entree , no max . umm super cool ? great decor
4 ahhh how i love love love this store . i feel like i 'm back in seattle and get get all the asian goodies i grew up eating . this place is a true gem . i often pick up some new type of noodle , fried goodie or ``
2 stopped in for a few pizzas with the fam . pretty good pizza , nice local little spot . we had this pizza with meatballs and pepperoni and a margherita . both were pretty good . maybe next time i 'll try a sandwich . solid 3 stars
3 always a huge fan of <unk> 's hideaway . i went with the green chile meatloaf with eggs , $ 12 . very well done meatloaf with just the right amount of heat , awesome with over easy eggs ! i also put back a few bloody mary 's with
3 rokerij is worth the hype . we popped in last week for a late bite and left super happy . we scored a few seats at the bar , the place was super crowded -lrb- which is a good sign on a wednesday -rrb- . i started with a beer
4 what a gem !!!! i tried this place for the first time yesterday , and we ended up going back again today !!! the chicken schwarma sandwiches are awesome . the hummus is great , and the chicken <unk> with garlic sauce is going to be the death of me
4 wow , super impressed ! i 've never been but have always heard about it . i generally try to stay away from huge chain restaurants , but this place wows . i started my meal with a 1/2 dozen raw oysters , super fresh and just perfect ! i
3 so <unk> after my last experience here , i posted a <unk> good review . i received a message from amber , the general manager at the restaurant apologizing for the service and inviting me back . she sent me a gift certificate to come back , how cool is
2 came out last night with a few friends . the bar was cool , but i 'm really not a fan of the crowd in old town . the drink prices were not bad , but it was a blast dancing outside . overall a pretty cool spot .
4 so i 'd heard of culver 's , but never eaten there until this one opened up . wow oh wow , what a great place ! i 've now been there 3 or 4 times and really dig their burgers !!! the onion rings were totally awesome too !
1 so we popped in to get some food , we thought they were still doing the beer , fries and bud light for 8 bucks but they were n't . no biggie . we decided to eat here anyways . my buddy and i decided to split the burger ,
4 new favorite brunch spot !!!! wifey took me here for father 's day brunch yesterday and it did not disappoint ! first off , they have $ 5 cocktails , pitchers of beer and mary 's ! they have a traditional bloody mary and my fave , the verde mary
3 real quick update . they now offer sweet potato fries as a free alternative to their regular fries . i decided to go with them today to accompany my teriyaki burger instead of the norm , and they were amazing .
3 so we ended up there again last night after a failed attempt to check out cafe <unk> -lrb- <unk> ' t know it was closed on sundays -rrb- . we were sat immediately , and had a dope server -lrb- i think his name was justin ? -rrb- . we
3 so we 've been back to this place several times . the pizza 's always been very good , and i 'm pretty hard to <unk> when it comes to my pie . after the <unk> delivery incident , we just decided to get takeout and have had not one
1 so let 's get this out of the way up front : the food here 's pretty good . there i said it . i always enjoy the food , there 's not been one thing there that i 've eaten that i did n't like . that being said
3 how in the world did i not know that rula bula had such a fantastic patio <unk> i 'm a native , and have never visited rula until last night . wow , seriously , who knew ? i guess a ton of people . everytime i am in tempe
4 love santisi 's ! ok , so it gets freaking crowded on football sunday , i mean like lines waiting for the place to open , and still not being able to get a seat , if you are in said line ! but there is a reason for it
4 my first time visiting el chorro lodge and i was blown away ; i went right when the sunset was about to begin and that set the mood . i sat in the dining room next to the large doors that were open to the outside and you could see
4 after passing this place a couple of times , i wanted to eat here for my lunch break so i called the tasty thai to ask how long the dish would take to cook , the person that answered was very polite and she offered to set up my table
1 i do n't know where to begin , i was born in california , lived in chicago for 15 years both of those locales had better mexican food . now after living in arizona for the last year trying some restaurants and take away spots . what is the deal
4 outback has a new bar menu and what better way to introduce it than to have yelp 's elite take it for a spin . thank you outback and thank you lindsey for hosting such a cool night out . sampling the coconut shrimp , delicious margherita flat bread and
3 the saturday hangover took it 's evil course and vietnamese food was a necessary evil this afternoon . i was in tempe , and my friend and i agreed on vietnamese . i remembered a past visit here , and had an ok experience . i figure with a more
0 as far as the quality of the finished product goes , i 'd give it three stars . nothing great , nothing terrible . my shirts were done up . my suit was lookin ' fly . i dress nice . the thing that really <unk> my ass about this
2 nothing like zipps ! today , i met up with a couple of old co-workers at this location . we had some cocktails and grub . i usually go to the location on camelback , but this was right around the corner from my friend 's house , so it
4 so last weekend , after patties , i ended up going to silver mine because there was no way in hell i was going to wait in line for 45 minutes for a philly cheesesteak . especially since i am doing so well with my `` eating healthy '' kick
2 this store is very close to my house , but it 's not why i 'm so favorable on the review . pros : produce selection is good , pricing is a little better than most places , and the store is clean . the beer selection is awesome !
3 all around a good experience . normally i 'd give this a three star , but i 'm feeling generous today ! i had some friends in town this weekend , and we finally had a chance to meet up . my buddy asked for a recommendation for a place
1 meh . my standards for quality froyo are high since i frequent yogurtology -lrb- shea and scottsdale -rrb- , yogurtland -lrb- i 'm the duke in scottsdale -rrb- , and sometimes i go to mojo in tempe . this place has `` ok '' flavors . i had the original
4 i 've done some reviews on capriotti 's shops in las vegas , so it 's fitting i visit the nearest shop to my home in scottsdale and write about it . grab the bobbie , the <unk> , or the grilled italian . you wo n't be disappointed .
3 now , a somewhat dinner review . my out of town visitor said she wanted a place like buffalo wild wings , but better . and she wanted beer . i said ... ok . culinary dropout it is . last night , we were promptly seated , ordered our
3 my friend and i were out and about on the town , and we were looking for a great place to hang out . someplace fun , not pretentious , definitely not <unk> . we hopped on yelp and found sidebar . both of us live in scottsdale , and
0 i wish they had a `` 0 '' star option . # 1 . the hostess was <unk> sick . # 2 . as we were getting our food , our son dropped some raw chicken onto the counter top . as we already passed through , my husband stopped
4 it 's been awhile since i 've been so excited about a restaurant . we went here twice in one week . the atmosphere is good . about 5-6 booths with tables as well . sushi bar seating . bright blue neon lights ... at first were a bit bright
3 cheap vietnamese food , little portions but the hot pot looks cool . do not get the pork <unk> , such a little portion . food is good , stick with the pho and so down to try the hot pot looks generous and cool !
2 <unk> , umm maybe i was old town the wrong day . service sucked but the place was big , maybe ill be back for someones birthday if they have a bar crawl here but by choice im not sure ill be back had to wait 30 mins to get
4 i love the light rail when it doesnt take long ! yay its extending ! also its free when you ride if you are seeing something at at the u.s. airways center
4 okay best mall in arizona ever ! its like arizona 's version of a downtown new york or san francisco . when i shop here i feel like im shopping in one of the hotels in vegas where there is a mix of high end stores and affordable trendy stores
3 i like this place because i live by it !! mini golf is so cute here ! also a hanging <unk> course and zip lining yay for the best attractions . get a discounted ticket at <unk> for under $ 18 or pay full price at $ 25 does not
4 i love breadfruit ! the last time i went in i was bummed to see they were n't carrying my favorite <unk> dish any longer -lrb- maybe it was seasonal ? -rrb- but the food was fantastic , as was the vegan dessert . if i lived closer i would
4 great drinks at happy hour and tasty vegan options ! breakfast potatoes can be made vegan and there are plenty of vegan sides and even some pastries .
3 oh what the hell , let 's give this place an even 60 reviews . i 'd like to say that this place is really more a 3.5 stars but i 'm in a good mood today so i 'm rounding up . i met up with a bunch of
3 i love this place . every time i 'm in there , i find something new and cool that i love . first plus is that it 's super convienent to where i live . it 's produce selection far beats the pathetic department of my neighborhood fry 's and
4 my husband and i were out running errands and we were famished . i remembered gabi k. had written a review on breadcrafters and being a sandwich lover , i made the executive decision that we were going to stop in and try it . it 's a bit tricky
3 in the buffet world , sweet tomatoes is a 5 star . in the world of <unk> in general , it 's probably only a 2 star but this place goes above and beyond . my sister , the starving college student , was in town and we decided to
4 last stop fo the day for me . i met jack t. and leslie here for some knitting . i had picked the place randomly and i am happy it was fair trade . they had a wonderful seating area to sit and chat . i grabbed a cup of
3 pita jungle is good solid food , nothing fancy . the location is n't anything fancy either but it is good people watching . i 'm with dominick , the chicken shwarma pita is my standby . it 's <unk> but the price is right . since this location is
3 ordered out here today and was very pleased with the food . i got the iron pot -lrb- <unk> udon -rrb- and it was tasty although i would have liked more vegetables . it had tons of seafood . the pot stickers were yummy . perfect flavor and perfectly cooked
4 best cheese curds and onion rings in town , and the burgers are really , really good . not sure about this surly waitress everyone mentions , but we usually belly up to the bar and have great service . seriously , do not even think about not ordering one
3 went here for post dinner drinks last night . i 've eaten here before and really enjoyed it -lrb- but it 's been so long ago i wo n't base the review on that -rrb- . the drinks here are really nice and unique . great ambiance and i love
3 had dinner here after oktoberfest shenanigans and this place really hit the spot . the service was good and the pizza was fantastic . i love the potato one -lrb- do n't remember the name -rrb- and the crust on the simple pepperoni was stellar . the thai pizza was

3 visit date <unk> : i was really impressed with our visit . we brought our friends from france and the waitress was really accommodating with our goal of ordering lots to share family style . she even suggested their veggie tamale that was really good . i ca n't wait
3 we put our name on the long list for matt 's big breakfast and headed out to get a cup of coffee . the coffee shop at the grocery store across the street was closed on sunday so we ended up here . the coffee was great and the menu
3 this was a quaint little restaurant and reminds me of house of trick near asu . i feel like i 'm in the french <unk> enjoying a home-cooked meal . what 's interesting about this restaurant is that the menu is constantly revolving and they use whatever ingredients they have
3 after a long day of shopping in scottsdale fashion we decided to try out some new restaurant nearby and eventually settled on wildfish . i have heard some good things about this place before , and for most part , the praises were well deserved . as we walked to
4 i had a great time at the culinary festival and it was a nice and sunny sunday afternoon to be there . but the first thing i thought of when i arrived is what us chinese would say `` people mountain . people sea . '' omg . there are
4 this is one of my all time favorite restaurants . the food is always amazing . they have the best crab wontons i have ever had . the orange chicken is always very good . great service and atmosphere . never dissappointed !
1 i wanted to be able to give this place 5 stars . i love tea places . however , my thai boba tea just really did n't have much flavor . <unk> dates tea was ok but they must have just brewed it and did n't tell us that and
3 been here a few times now and i love the couches and fire places at night . i think it is a fantastic area to be able to do so much at once . shopping , eating , dave and busters , a theater with a cine capri , etc.
4 this is my favorite mexican food restaurant anywhere ! they have the best spinach con queso dip ! the chimi 's are also always very good . service is great , salsa is yummy !
2 great atmosphere , small place though so during peak times i am sure you will want to have a reservation . the stuffed artichoke appetizer was amazing . they even let me order it at lunch when it is n't on the menu . great service . the meatball hero
3 2nd year in a row that i have come for <unk> ! the pumpkins are expensive and there 's a lot of dust , but all that gets forgotten watching the pig races ! it 's a fun way to spend an afternoon . great for families and for groups
3 i 've been missing lola 's tapas for about a year now and have been in search of a new tapas place . tapas papas <unk> is good , but more formal than iruna . iruna felt more casual while still being trendy and nice inside . the sangria was
4 fantastic hh . $ 5 oak barrel aged cocktails -lrb- <unk> and manhattans are <unk> -rrb- 1/2 off all bar bites 1/2 off beer 1/2 off all glasses of wine daily 3-6 i can not believe i just discovered their hh . service never <unk> here . i love it
3 a good jukebox , a nice section of pool tables and plenty of seating make this one of my favorite old school phoenix bars . years ago , they had a reputation for being `` soft '' on id 's , so i was a regular when i was home
3 i am a big fan of this place . and i 'm not really into tires so to be `` into '' a tire place for me is saying something . like any other tire shop , they 'll rotate and change tires for you at the going rate ,
2 i may have caught it on a bad night , but i thought that devil 's was just okay . i have some friends that loooove this place , and i can see the potential for a great time ... if it is n't quite so crowded . the line
3 great place to see a show ... aside from the spinning stage , which is obviously pretty rad , <unk> theater makes my favorites list because of the acts it manages to bring to town . for being a relatively small place , they pull their weight and then some
3 this is what i remember as being the `` east end '' of scottsdale growing up . i was a north central phoenix kid , so i did n't have much occasion to come out this direction until atleast middle school . when i did make it out this way
3 the rhythm room is hands-down one of my favorite places to see music in phoenix . along with the clubhouse , they are picking up the slack that the mason jar has left behind ... i 've seen a few great shows here , and all were unexpected . tickets
3 drift manages to take its tiki theme and make it chic . which makes it ... <unk> ? sorry ... anyhow i really like drift . it draws a more laid back crowd and provides a few different areas to hang out in . it comfortably <unk> the line between
3 as a mexican food snob , it pains me to say this . it pains me to say that i love a corporate franchise that is owned by mcdonald 's , but i do , so there , and it 's chipotle . something about the brick of a burrito
4 i swear to god i would give this place seven stars if it were possible . maybe 8 . this is a staple for friends from out of town that i preface with `` oh you think you have good mexican food in -lrb- blank -rrb- . you 've been
3 there are a number of these around town and i have been in no rush whatsoever to go to one . my impression was that it was going to be another healthy salad and sandwich type of restaurant , which is n't normally my style . i was right about
2 i 'm not a giant fan of stingray . i like the setup and the location and the food even , but all in all it does n't stack up too well against its competitors . first off , the last time i went there i had to sit outside
3 despite my typical <unk> against swanky scenester bars in phoenix , the merc bar pulls it off quite well . located just across from houston 's in the esplanade center , merc bar is perfect drink spot for a dinner and a movie date . it 's dark with sultry
4 at first , i was a little disappointed in the menu selection . only three sandwiches plus two daily specials ? and then , no normal drinks ? all a brother wanted was a diet coke but they ... did n't carry coke or pepsi ? what kind of restaurant
4 there are no menus here . just a big chalkboard that <unk> over you before you step into a short line and order your burger . the first thing you may notice is the `` retirement burger , '' with a price tag of a cool million bucks , and
4 in a town like phoenix , independent cinema is hard to come by . which is why i use netflix . also , it is why i frequent this <unk> independent movie theater in the heart of scottsdale . it could be just a coincidence , but it seems like
3 it 's a dive bar plain and simple . you ca n't hide it , and if you go there , you better be expecting to embrace it . i 've been twice in the last week , the first times in all my years of scottsdale bars . my
3 i love bowling . unfortunately i do n't go often enough to get better than an average 110 score . out of the several dozen bowling alleys i have been to , this one is among the nicest . my best advice is to call in advance and see what
3 it seems like everytime i come here i see someone i know who i never see anymore . a good sign that this place is a popular watering hole on mill . i 'll say my only negative at the beginning here : i 'm not a huge fan of

0 julio g 's resides at the very bottom of the barrel when it comes to mexican food in the valley . from the outside the bright and <unk> colored building might make you think that it 's some tasty independently owned hole in the wall , but do n't fall
3 if they just had more locations i envision this place being the ultimate ` <unk> ' . i know it 's a bit <unk> to love chain restaurants here on yelp ... but i ca n't help it , costa vida has got the goods . it 's all about

4 wow , this place is great ! i ordered the heirloom tomato salad and the vegetarian pizza . my uncle who dined with me ordered stuffed mushrooms and <unk> . everything was extremely tasty and the service was great . it is a very small little place , so i

3 i was lucky enough to visit cafe monarch about 2 months ago for a friend 's birthday , and i ca n't wait to go back ! tracy 's review was right on the money when she described this place as being invited to your friend 's house for a
3 not bad . i like that they will make the pho with egg noodles instead of the traditional rice noodles if you ask . i deff prefer it that way and recommend to anyone who likes pho to try it that way . muy delish ! this place is deff
4 who does n't love ikea ? though for the record - the prices have gone up . : - -lrb-
3 food - the complimentary chips and salsa are delicious . the chips are homemade and a little bit thicker than most restaurant tortilla chips . the salsa is also really good . i typical get a mixture of side dishes and mix them together to make a `` naked ''
4 i love north . i think the atmosphere is awesome . they have a great patio and a nice interior . the wait staff is always polite and helpful . the restaurant is nicely kept and clean . they give you delicious marinated olives and bread with a compound butter
4 yogurt builderz is the top of the line build your own sundae , yogurt toppings bar . the toppings are varied and fresh . they have many different flavors , including the only 8 variety , which is 8 calories per ounce -- and lactose free . delicious !!!
4 had heard of this spot ages ago but never understood how interesting their menu was until my friend casually mentioned their 1lb burgers while passing by ... pull <unk> - <unk> !! we walk in and immediately i realize that they have not only 1lb beef burgers but exotic meats
3 haha ... so i came in here to take on the ultimate slider challenge on <unk> with a group of friends and made a video <unk> of the whole thing . check it out on <unk> to see the result : <unk> posted : picture of the slider challenge plate
1 so this is the first time i 've downgraded a review this much ! my first time there was great , probably because the owners were cooking . but now that they have it off the ground a new chef was hired and it is not anywhere near what it
1 i really wanted to like this place since it 's right around the corner and we 're huge fans of italian food . but our waiter had a bad attitude right from the start . he made us feel unwelcome , like we were a <unk> to him . i
0 i have given this place so many chances over the past year or so to get it together on their poor service . you would think with as many reviewers complaining about slow and disorganized service it would improve by now , but wow , was i wrong ! i
4 wow , this place really exceeded my expectations . excellent , amazing , wonderful pizza !!!! i would say it is right up there with pizzeria bianco , but without the wait . we will definitely go back soon . the beet salad was delicious and perfect , and we
4 blah , blah , blah ... best pizza in the world ... almost silly for me to write a review about chris bianco 's pizzeria , but here goes ... kari and i cook at home , for ourselves and for groups , 5 or 6 days a week unless

3 my pregnant wife -lrb- the <unk> -rrb- <unk> pancakes on sundays and after each dr visit . she seems to be booking a lot of dr visits . as usual , original pancake house -lrb- oph -rrb- was f ` ing packed . too hot to wait outside . we
0 i picked this particular og because it is the closest <unk> , <unk> , to my compound . as succinctly as possible : you suck the life out of italian food , you bastards . you are the epitome of all that is wrong with corporate food service . the
2 this one is hard . the whole place is conflicted between excellence and <unk> . the good -lrb- aka : the food -rrb- if you 've been to another roku , or even a nobu , the menu will look familiar , as will the prices . the sushi selection
0 i was incredibly unhappy with this experience . i will probably not eat at any macaroni grill for a very long time . the waitress was incredibly young and <unk> . she put in the wrong order for our table ; but you had to feel sorry for her cause
4 pros : my favorite restaurant in az . . i have never ordered anything that i have n't enjoyed . nothing tops their pesto sauce . the best part is , it comes free with the bread at the beginning of the meal . last night , i ordered the
4 i love <unk> ! the glazed carrots are hands down my favorite . yesterday we had ashley as a server for lunch and she was fantastic .
3 i was here for a gentleman jack event and i really enjoyed it ! it has a really nice atmosphere and the food i tried was fantastic . i ca n't wait to come back and actually have a full meal !
3 i 've been here a few times . the food is always good and the service is awesome ! i 've always been sat quickly , drinks are always quick to arrive at the the table , which out here when it 's hot is one of the best things
4 i 've been to a few of the oregano 's locations , multiple times and they are very consistent in service and food quality . i love the service ! the wait staff is always really friendly , your drink is filled , and they almost always offer you a
4 i love culinary dropout ! i 've been to both az locations and both are good ! the service is always <unk> and i love the food ! pretzels and fondue are definitely a must have . the meat and cheese 's are also good ! i 've had a
2 add then smoosh . add then smoosh . add then smoosh . i have seen this type of grilling in the mall before but never actually felt the urge to dine there . i came here with friends who walked me through the experience . first of all , it
3 we were looking for a steakhouse on yelp and decided to go here based on the good reviews on yelp . so far , this has been the second best place we have gone to eat since we have been in arizona -lrb- first was at ed 's <unk> -rrb-
1 overpriced . overrated . just not worth the money . the mac and cheese with the different toppings is actually very delicious . we also got duck which was extremely bland and did not have the crispy skin . the risotto it was served with was terrible . it was
3 i am always thrilled to discover quality and unique non-chain eateries in the phoenix area . the artisan bread the sandwich was assembled on was delicious . i ordered the mozzarella , tomato , basil sandwich . you could taste the quality mozzarella but i found the ingredients would have
3 yum . i like rudy 's . i used to eat at rudy 's when i lived in albuquerque . my favorite meal was smoked turkey and the butter drenched potatoes and it is here in chandler too . the turkey is tender and a bit smoky , potatoes are

2 let me say i love cakes and cupcakes or pretty much all things sugar . i was so happy to be walking in the mall with my boys after a movie and see a new cupcake bakery ! even though we had eaten lunch before the movie and ate sugary
4 the best breakfast you will ever have . i ca n't tell you why - maybe take the most simple foods but make sure they are the highest quality , cook with butter or olive oil and you get perfection ? i do n't know the secret but people will
2 i went to brat haus for lunch today with local first arizona . i was really excited when i saw they have a veal sausage on the menu . i was hoping it was a <unk> - a white veal sausage that i 've never been able to find in
3 urban cookies has a wonderful gluten-free cupcake with delicious frosting . i hope they make more gluten-free flavors in the future . the shop is very cute too .
4 i love bosa donuts . they are so moist , sweet , and delicious . i 've never had a donut from there that was n't excellent but the buttermilk bar and the old fashioned glazed are my favorites . i love that they 're open late for those of
3 have been craving the tempe pita jungle for a bit now . just miss the place ... have n't been there in over a year . so , i was riding the light rail today getting some errands done and just decided ... `` hey , i 've got nothing
4 very fast , friendly , and efficient service . got to walk across the street to do some shopping while getting new tires . they have a small waiting room but decided to do some shopping instead . do n't know why anyone would go anywhere else . great job
1 average . not the best , not the worst . i ca n't honestly remember any spectacular about what i ate . i had their `` famous '' chicken pizza , and it was nothing to write home about . our server suggested the wings as they were `` amazing
1 average . i went for dinner , not drinks , and the food was unimpressive . the bloody mary was served with a slim jim straw , which was different to say the least . it seems this place is all about image , but not about substance .
1 borderline average sushi . this is a place to see and be seen , but not a serious sushi destination . ra is for the status conscious , and i do n't quite understand why as it is not particularly trendy , fancy or special .
1 they 're not <unk> the wheel here -- simple sandwiches and sides for a reasonable price . service was adequate , and the place was quiet on a saturday afternoon . i had a blt , it was meaty , but the bacon was thin and you could tell it
3 reminds me of my travels to guadalajara with all its grilled meats , little spicy sauces and freshly <unk> veggies and fruit . the portions are huge , service is attentive , quick and very efficient . these folks are really on it , no mistakes on take away orders
3 had to pick up some walking shoes for our upcoming trip , so we decided after seeing this urban style mall several months ago to check it out , that way we would n't have to drive to n scottsdale for the <unk> store . after our 1.5 hr drive
3 one of the best truly local breakfast restaurants i have been to . the belgian waffle was very good as was the chorizo green chili omelette . be sure to go early if you want breakfast as the place is very small . not sure i would wait outside like
3 always a friendly place with great food and drink . a bit expensive for my personal tastes but a great place for business . will be back the next time i am up in scottsdale !
4 this place is bangin ' like a <unk> or blood !! a new fav . in my book !
3 great stadium to watch football , except for the socially <unk> cardinals fun sitting to the right and above us that would n't shut up and looked like he has taken one to many beer bottles to the head . this is <unk> dude !!! not the super bowl .
4 took the wife here for date night , love the food here !! service is world class . ca n't say a bad thing about this place , except i wish they had one closer to our neck of the woods ... gilbert that is !!
3 so i went in here on a mission to find <unk> 's own organics -lrb- do n't ask !! -rrb- i did find them !!! the staff is great , they have a lot of great food choices and a bar with local brews !! -lrb- the bar sold me
2 had the 1/2 po ` boy and cup of gumbo . delish ! slight bitterness in the gumbo , but mixed in a little of that <unk> it made it great . nice place for lunch , sat outside in the perfect march weather .
2 i tasted <unk> turkey brie sandwich with their beet and <unk> salad . delicious ! but they do n't have much other food . their menu is limited . i believe its more of a coffee place .
3 as i just finished my brisket breakfast taco from rudy 's i realized i really need to write a review for this joint . i 've eaten at rudy 's all over tx and was happy to see they opened one here . i 've always been a huge fan
2 since i just <unk> firehouse in my review for planet sub , i thought i better come on over here and write my review . at firehouse the food gets 5 stars . the rest of the process is what makes it a 3 . their brisket sub is <unk>
3 to conclude our day date on sunday , after we left fox cigar bar we went to cantina laredo for an early dinner . i had eaten at the scottsdale location twice last year for lunch and enjoyed it then , so i thought i would take the husband to
4 even though i love the burgers i decided to branch out and try something else today and man am i ever glad i did . i ordered the baja shrimp tacos which put my mouth in a world of happiness because of their great grilled flavor and that wonderful smoky
2 not that i know what good or real korean is ... but i am a fan of any good <unk> cuisine . simple decor and we were attended to quickly -lrb- i think we were the second table -rrb- . the table ordered the korean bbq ribs and i got
3 expensive , relaxed , sultry , with a ginormous <unk> sized patio and courtyard area - <unk> phoenix -lrb- or should i say pv -rrb- . my first time here ever so can not compare to the old and on a wednesday did n't have a reservation so was seated
3 goodness ... dusting myself off and getting a few <unk> of oil before i get started . oh yelp , how i have missed you ... in my new quest to <unk> my self through as many new dining spots as possible , i was fortunate enough to receive an
2 great italian place for the price . i had their <unk> pasta bowl with wheat rigatoni , the consistency of the pasta and flavor of the sauce were pretty good but i still had to flavor it up with spice and herbs , not what i was expecting for something
2 i 'd have to say this was average for most divey little mexican places . being so close to the freeway you are likely to pass right by without a second thought . you ca n't judge a book by its cover because while the outside says ugh , the
3 i 'm going to be honest here , i 'm not sure if i 'm giving fez a four-star rating or just thomas . i figure since at least half of all the reviews for this place mention thomas , and that it is practically impossible to say the word
4 i want to hate you , pane bianco . i really really want to hate you . with every fabulous <unk> in my being . you have weird hours , an overwhelming `` not quite industrial , not quite rustic '' decor , and your $ 8 mozzarella , tomato
2 let 's call a spade a spade ; there 's really not that much that separates pullano 's from any of its competition , of which there is plenty . there 's a hungry howie 's down 51st street , a ballpark pizza on thunderbird , pizza by napoli in
4 oh oh omg . i have lived here for 25 years and finally found my cheesesteak thrill . i am originally from philly sooooo if it makes me happy you will love it . first of all , <unk> is the man . he takes such good care of us
1 disappointed . went yesterday with my son for the first time . started in the shoe section . within a few minutes i had been shoved twice . wow . manners people . i did find a michael kors shrug for a great price but i will probably not go
1 i have lived in az for over 25 years and had heard this was a nice place to go . for our 27 anniversary we decided to give it a try . we had planned to sit outside but the night we went it happened to be a very chilly
4 we have been here a dozen times and enjoy it every time . i am making my way through the menu and there is nothing i would not recommend . they are fast too . i enjoy sitting outside when the weather is nice .
1 very very disappointed in the fact that they have discontinued several of their salad bar prepared salads . i loved their southwest lentil salad and the mediterranean orzo salad . the lentil salad is gone . and the orzo salad has changed . not in a good way . so
3 i have been taking people here for 25 years . from celebrating a special occasion to taking my sons teachers there to wish them well on their retirement to taking our out of town visitors out for a sunday brunch they will never forget - this is the place .
4 warm potato chips . omg . they are the best . i have been going to this restaurant for years and have never had a bad meal . it 's a place i take out of town friends too because it 's not a place they have in their state
2 the place looks pretty nice and is a casual hang out sort of place but they really do n't cook any food there . the kitchen must really be bare bones because the food is like a sandwich shop type set-up . really surprising given we love humble pie up
3 i 've lived where there are four of these shops in the same strip mall -lrb- seattle , houston -rrb- and while lee 's is n't the best ever , the fact that it exists and is clean and tasty makes me really appreciate it . i ca n't for
2 this may be heresy but i felt like the food was just pretty good . certainly the chef is a down to earth , nice host . the restaurant is small and in a nice location way in cave creek . we drove from chandler for this meal and had
1 i could n't agree with david more . the owner is definitley an interesting person . the more money she thinks you make , the more she will talk to and love you ! so tell her you are rich !! -lrb- sorry <unk> c. -rrb- as for the food
3 it 's a thai explosion in chandler - not that i 'm complaining . me and the missus stopped in for dinner . service - terrible , atrocious , slow , haphazard . food - delicious , spicy , cheap . it 's a good thing i lower my service
2 even though i am officially in my 30s , i look like i 'm still in college , which made me feel slightly less uncomfortable when i walked into the clubhouse . yes , it is near asu , and yes , it is an <unk> venue , so i
2 martini ranch is that girl who tries to look chic and a little messy like one of the <unk> twins , but does n't quite pull it off and ends up looking <unk> and a little <unk> . the place just seems a little out of place in scottsdale 's
3 my first visit to the rhythm room was about a month ago , -lrb- yes , i 'm just getting around to reviewing it -rrb- , and i was pretty pleased . this particular night and particular show did n't garner a huge turnout , but it was decent for
2 my first visit to blanco was one that i will remember for awhile . i 'll begin by saying that the food was good . i had the machaca beef tacos and a margarita . the beef was very flavorful with just the right amount of spicy kick to it
4 just wanted to let everyone know that sylvia 's is now a <unk> , <unk> restaurant . they are still working out some kinks -- as in , training waiters to be actual waiters . but , the food is still great !
4 despite spilling delicious pomegranate green tea all over my shorts and chair , i must say that my dinner at sens was ... well ... <unk> . i was a little hesitant coming here -- i was n't sure what to expect from a restaurant that served `` asian fusion
1 thank goodness they were n't busy . there was only one other party in front of us and we still had to wait quite a while to place our order . i could n't imagine if the place was busy . the fries are out of this world , the
3 wonderful . this is a cozy atmosphere with dark wood and booths . like a casual version of capital grille . i love that they have a piano playing at night . it is so hard to believe how healthy the food is as it is delicious and filling .
3 we went on friday night at 8 pm . thankfully , i made reservations . we were seated right away and the service was very friendly . it is a cool , hip , casual atmosphere . as others have stated , this place is noisy ! there are a
3 went there with a bunch of people from work . the food was fantastic -lrb- meat and cheese plates with nuts , all different types of bruschetta - yum ! -rrb- i love the seating with the big comfy couches . the wine was $ 5 on happy hour -lrb-
3 similar to houston 's but better . we used to be houston 's regulars but now go to j alexander 's instead as they have consistent food quality and better service . love the warm bread and soft butter they start you with . i had the burger and fries
1 i got the jack not jill sandwich . maybe it was my fault for changing the hamburger bun out to wheat toast but , this sandwich was very lackluster . the fries were soggy and not crisp at all . i wo n't be rushing back and , if i
2 the food is excellent and the wait staff are super friendly but man is the service <unk> ! i realize that they care about every dish but , their wait times are ridiculous . you ca n't be in a rush or on your lunch break when you go to
3 we had a wonderful dinner here . we sat out on the patio -lrb- they need to grow their <unk> another foot or so to block the parking lot and then it would be perfect -rrb- . my boyfriend got the lasagna and i got the special which was various

2 on the one hand ... i love the ranchero skillet . its freaking delicious and i have had it more than a few times . its super filling , and the last time i ate it , i even got full halfway through it and had enough for leftovers this
3 sweet baby jesus ! i am carrying the most massive food baby right now . my husband was craving pasta so i researched some new places we could go to get some . oregano 's seemed to be a big hit so we settled on this place for dinner tonight
2 so far i have been here two times . i purchased two groupons for this restaurant and used the second one today . we were here once for dinner , and once for lunch . service : the first time we went , we had a new waitress . she
4 this is my 2nd time at north and i must say that the quality of food for the price is great ! my server was brian tonight as he made my our night that much better . . brian is very friendly and really seems to enjoy working at this
4 cholla trail is a lot of fun and moderate hike . echo <unk> is a lot of fun but also more challenging . overall both trails are so much fun and a great workout .
4 one of my top 2 best places i have ever experienced . my girl and i went for our first time last night for my birthday and it was an amazing experience with amazing food choices . definitely will be going again !
3 place is full and long lines ; however you can pay $ 5 and get in the front and a free house shot . drinks are inexpensive and really good ! lots of pool tables and great environment . one of my select places i love to go when on
4 i had lived in arizona quite a while before i tried city hall . i thought it was kind of just another steakhouse . when i met my boyfriend , turns out this is his favorite place . lucky for me ! they make the most exceptional filet . mmmmm
3 i was a little hesitant about going here due to the look -lrb- silly me , my favorite place los dos molinos is the same way -rrb- , but i am glad i did . the employees were very , very friendly . the cheese crisp was really good ,
2 oh , ikea . i have such a love hate relationship with you . ikea is crazy , tiring , and crowded . i always say that i hope i do n't have to go back when i leave , and usually need some sort of <unk> after . as
4 i do n't shop at aj 's for weekly groceries -lrb- too pricey -rrb- , but i love coming to aj 's . it is so cozy and fresh . i head here with my family -lrb- i do n't drink , they do -rrb- to pick up a bottle
4 i love this park ! it 's a great place to take my son . he -lrb- and i -rrb- love riding the train . ca n't wait until it 's a little cooler out so we can go again : o -rrb-
4 this is fabulous gelato -- the likes of which i 've not had since working at chelsea 's when we served arlecchino . authentic , tasty , yumminess . after dining out with my hubby and kiddo , i wanted some frozen yogurt . our server recommended gelato at that
3 for a major metropolitan city , it 's disappointing how hard it is to find an independent coffee shop around phoenix/scottsdale that 's open on sundays . fortunately , fair trade cafe is open on sundays , and i appreciate that very much ! more than `` just '' being
3 i 'm kind of obligated to love this place , because my wife and i had our first date here and i proposed to her here -lrb- she said yes , too -rrb- . obviously , the restaurant holds lots of sentimental value to us , and i love that
3 i admit , i 'm still just a `` dude '' when it comes to eating out for lunch . when i 'm not eating pizza , i 'm usually eating hamburgers . the classic smashburger is now one of my favorite fast food burgers , and their chocolate milkshake
3 as much as i <unk> wanted to give this trader joe 's location a 5 star review , i have to say i 'm beginning to get annoyed that they are so consistently out of at least 2 - 3 things i 'm looking for each week . and i

2 had lunch here with robyn n. and rand h. for a fast food burger it was ok but i like a home burger much better . even most bar burgers have more <unk> french fries are good fresh cut fries and the toppings are added by you . if the

2 i felt like i was in another decade last week upon entering pattie 's . maybe the 1990 's ? 90 's music 90 's clothing -lrb- mixed with some <unk> trendy girls . why they were there i have no clue -rrb- 90 's <unk> 's on men .
2 went to lunch at the wild thaiger yesterday after having no luck ordering to-go a couple weeks ago . we sat outside on the covered patio , which was pretty busy . our server was prompt and pleasant . the food : i ordered chicken with peanut sauce and jasmine
3 there 's not much to be said that has n't been said about the christmas decor . i found it hilarious . so much to see on top of the great people watching . i found the coach house refreshingly tacky and delightful . the drinks were cheap , even

4 after much too long away from yelp , i 'm so tickled to have pcg as my first review back ! i love this sister restaurant to sierra bonita . the atmosphere is dark and cozy with a sw flair . always friendly servers who know nico 's family from
3 this park makes me want to pack it all up and move to tempe . it has it all , and hosts many major events because it has the space . and you are right there at the edge of dt tempe . what more could you want ? the
2 it was a bad experience with this place before i even got to the venue . i had bought tickets for green day the first time they were set to play in december . they canceled , and <unk> -lrb- the ticket provider for marquee -rrb- , gave no hint
3 whether you 've seen it one time or dozens , it 's always a nice evening walking through the zoo with all the lights twinkling . going the day after christmas probably was n't our best move , because the rest of the valley had the same idea . next
2 it 's not great ... but it 's not awful . a little overpriced for mediocre food . love the spinach enchiladas . if you 're in the area and there 's nowhere else close by you want to travel for mexican , it will do .
3 i love their hummus platter and their california club pita ! it 's quite the hip place , and always busy . i 'd rather do take out than stay in , because it 's just busy and loud . and i `` m a grumpy old lady . busy
4 tonight i was hanging out in the tapas bar for #evfn -lrb- east valley friday nights -rrb- . this is not my first time , and every time i attend i wonder why i ca n't get there once a month for this great event . it is so worth
1 food was nothing to complain about but does mexican food have to cost more than $ 5 ? if you enjoy paying $ 10-15 per person for beans , rice and tortillas , then you 've found the right place . we ate there at night and they seated us
0 blech ! let me start off by saying that my dad is the king of horrifying <unk> . strangely enough , they 've actually become a vital part of my <unk> and somewhat useful . 1 -rrb- if it sounds too good to be true , then it 's probably
0 met a girlfriend there for lunch the other day . waited 5 ~ <unk> seated at table for my girlfriend to show up . the whole time ignored by the waitresses . finally my girlfriend shows up , we order , our food arrives with no utensils on the table

4 i 've been shopping here since they opened their doors . over 10 years so you can say i 'm a happy loyal customer . in the past 10 years other asian supermarkets have opened and i do go and try them out but i always come back to lee
4 i just love this place . the vibe and food here is always just the right mix of excellence , deliciousness , and coolness . if vibes can be bottled , capture the vibe here to enhance your own personality , home , or business . will sure to turn
4 talk to any taiwanese person and you end up talking about food ! any asian person really , asian people love to talk and to eat ... is there anything better ??!! came here again with my son and as i <unk> over the menu , i could n't wait
3 i always enjoy going to oregano 's locations throughout the valley and this location has been great both times i <unk> here . steak salad is extremely good if you want to stay away from the starch ! love the service here ! wait time has always been bad but
2 i want to give this place more stars , really i do . but last time i went , i asked for my salad to go and wanted a half salad but it looked like it was only half of the half salad . also , i can never seem
3 i love flying southwest airlines . when i trying to book a flight on-line , the rates were changing and i had trouble with getting the lower price . so i called them . the person i spoke with got me the lower price and i was able to save

4 i am a recent college graduate who was really poor throughout school . i always shopped at walmart or safeway for groceries in the past . now that i live directly across from whole foods , i decided to stop in for a few ingredients the other day . i
2 the food is decent . i like the salads better than the subs , but i 'm picky about toasted bread . the first time i went to cheba hut , i liked the theme - toasted subs = stoner food so they have a lot of <unk> <unk> and
2 huge , delicious and sweet . that 's what you can expect from bosa ! i wish i knew about this place sooner . glad i tried it and you will be , too ! i like that they have a drive thru for the mornings you left the house
4 really good beer . awesome environment . try the hummus ! we had a great time here . ca n't wait to come back !
4 five stars ! that 's right , beer fans if you have n't seen what <unk> has to offer , you 're missing out ! first off their beer selection rocks . you can even brew your own beer and pick a name for it with their <unk> beer geniuses
4 delicious as always . do n't get delivery unless you have no other option - just go pick it up , they get super busy at lunch . if you ask for no onions you are probably still getting onions . they have awesome soups , but they tend to
1 pizza = not very good and very over priced salads = pretty inventive -lrb- won best salad in either phoenix magazine or the new times at some point in the past -rrb- total experience = safe place to take someone when you do n't know much about their food preferences
2 the d & d has a great selection of sandwhiches ... unless you 're a veg ... and then the selection is pretty limited ... although admittedly , i have never asked for the apple and brie sandwich without the turkey to see if they will make it for me
3 i have to admit , that i was initially going to give this place a bad rating . then i realized i should n't take out my personal <unk> on a bar . how does the roosevelt play in to my personal <unk> ? i show up to meet my
4 this place is fantastic . the owner chef has a gift . i am so spoiled . we eat mostly lamb and chicken curries , spicy , they have never sent out a dish that was n't <unk> hot and perfectly spiced . the owners are very nice people as
1 i have been here about 4 times - i have been offered frosty drinks each time with no cocktail napkin , the drinks drip and slide - it is a weird problem but wtf ? the food is <unk> bad - the owner was a <unk> guy at a big
0 take this place off my list ! first of all , they are very disorganized , no system at all . a coworker likes going to this place so another coworker and i decided to try it . what a disappointment . $ 7.00 for a lunch special of drink
3 hmmm . was just reading the bad reviews but what can i say , i love this place ! i have been coming here for lunch since i moved to arizona from california 13 years ago and they still have my favorite salad , sandwiches and the glazed lemon cookie
3 one of the best costco i 've been to and believe me , i go to a costco wherever i am for food , office supplies , gas , etc. . the customer service here is most awesome , the staff is always so helpful and ready to out of
3 this is definitely one of my favorite finds from yelp ! it 's not fancy inside but very cozy . sometimes seat yourself , sometimes there 's a hostess . i love the pizzas -lrb- thin crust -rrb- , wings , pasta , salads , and garlic bread . i
3 i 'm from chicago and i felt like i 'd stepped into a place back home . the lentil soup was delicious . nicest people too and inside was well maintained .
3 i like coming here because it 's the only shopping center i have ever been to that 's actually a park . it 's very pet friendly , and fitness friendly too . every restaurant there has good food , although they are very busy , so sometimes you can

4 i must be hitting the jackpot lately on dining at less busy times ! i ca n't think about anything not to rave about ! first , let me say i immediately noticed a difference in the atmosphere from this location to desert ridge . i liked it , definitely

2 i 'm a fan of hamburgers . but something about this place falls short . i ca n't quite put my finger on it . the beef is fresh but rare usually ends up being more medium which i am sure is for <unk> reasons . the rosemary fries are
4 my husband and i love this buffet . it is affordable and minus the salad , the food is always fresh . -lrb- but come on , who comes to a chinese buffet for the salad lol -rrb- the sushi is always fresh , and does n't taste too fishy
1 this is a review of the cafe within this market . this cafe specializes in numerous asian dishes . they have cooked ducks hanging in a display case . they feature drinks with boba and taro . a lot of the signs are written in chinese . it appears to

4 well , after two years i should probably update my review ! there is n't much to update , though . they have maintained the quality and flavor that got five stars from me two years ago . a friendly , casual place with some awesome pecan wood smoked meats
2 this is a decent place . the food is consistently good -lrb- not spectacular , but good -rrb- . a bit greasy , perhaps . service is generally good . beer is better than average -lrb- though no match for some other microbrews i could name -rrb- . they also
2 visited for lunch wednesday . first time . the food was good . not great , but good -lrb- my burrito was better than my wife 's entree -lrb- some sort of fried dish ... i forget what they called it ... not traditional at all , but had a
3 this is probably the best oriental market in the city . the next best one i can think of is in la . . they have a wide variety of products from all over the world , featuring nearly every culture on the planet . indian , <unk> , filipino
3 this is our favorite buca , and our favorite italian restaurant . the food here is always really good , and the service has always been attentive . their pizza -lrb- especially the supremo -rrb- is the best we 've had outside of italy . they have numerous pasta dishes
4 really good gelato . our third visit . we try to come here when we visit san tan village . numerous flavors , some of which change seasonally -lrb- no orange tonight !! -rrb- . others are pretty stable -lrb- <unk> the dark chocolate and limoncello -rrb- . the flavors
2 came here for lunch yesterday with my daddy . the location is sketchy to say the least , but once you get inside it 's nice . the menu was big but kind of expensive . pretty shitty they do n't have a lunch menu either . my dad was

2 came here for the 1st time today with my dad for lunch . the entrance door is huge ! it 's a bright & modern space , i dug it . the chairs were n't the <unk> , but eh whatever most modern furniture is n't . any way ,
3 i have been to sushi brokers twice now . my 2nd time was today for their 4-6 :30 pm happy hour . my girl jessica & i got there around 5:15 . i think we just beat the dinner rush because by the time we left around 7:30 it was
4 have been here a handful of times with my hubby for lunch . i would have never given this place a 2nd look , but its literally a 2 minute drive from my work so i thought why not ? glad i did because pizza a metro is the bomb
3 after picking up my car from the body shop , i decided to get myself a lil treat . urban cookies came to mind since it has been one of my bookmarks for a few months now . since this was my 1st visit here i tried a lil bit
3 i heard about torched goodness through yelp -lrb- of course -rrb- , & liked them on facebook so i could see where they would be located , since they move around all the time . they ran a special around thanksgiving & christmas , 12 for $ 35 . i
3 i have been to pappadeaux a couple times , but yesterday for lunch was the most recent . my dad & bro like to eat lunch early to beat the `` lunch crowd '' so when we got there around 11:15 it was pretty dead , probably only about 10

4 as you come up to pinnacle peak this appears like it will be a daunting trek . as you watch people seemingly go straight up on <unk> you may get the impression you are in for heavy workout . however , this is a hike for beginners to <unk> level
4 fun fun fun . . truly unique dishes and appetizers with an amazing selection of <unk> for your dinner next door at az wine . it 's a hole in the wall but somehow comes across as chic and cave-like . talk to your significant other and suggest a date
2 this restaurant/bar is conveniently located in scottsdale mall . i 've had a lot of items on the menu and they are all pretty good . this comes off like high quality bar food , but the execution is n't quite there . they have something like a 100 +
2 all around pretty fun place to be . its a good hybrid between a dance club and outside bar . i went their my first night in the valley . i remember looking and seeing more breast <unk> than i 'd seen in my entire life up to that point
4 just a really chill bar with a good crowd . last time we were there we had some legit pizza and some type of appetizer sampler . all good ! pours are also generous here and every once in a while some local <unk> wonder in for a drink as
4 always a great time here . today i opted for the wonton soup . i think it 's the best in the valley with fresh wontons , a great broth , and little pieces of shrimp and fish cake in there . the bbq pork also adds to the flavor
4 i have to say , the three star rating threw me before coming for dinner here . morton 's has always been one of my favorite places to dine , and i 've been to many across the country . i 'm happy to report that i was n't disappointed
4 excellent food , perfect burger , fries served in a shopping cart . go for the classic standard burger . perfect brioche bun , that lends to the perfect bite of very tasty beef and cheese . i really ca n't wait to go back . there is also a
3 a couple of beers , a chicken sausage pizza and an order of spaghetti squash ... what a great lunch in a posh location . a much needed escape from a really hot summer day . our very helpful server went through the entire food pyramid , and told us
3 my wifey and i came here last night . i had seen this while browsing through for some place good to eat since i did n't want to go to macaroni grill or outback . parking was lacking but i guess it 's fitting for a place that can probably

3 we come here often and are never disappointed . they have very good beers -lrb- i especially enjoyed the blonde summer honey which is seasonal -rrb- . they have mac n ' cheese that is out of this world . the summer chicken quesadilla is really good as well .

4 we kept driving by the spotted donkey and one friday night we finally decided to stop by and see what it was about . we sat on the patio , which was great . we were right by the fireplace , and it was romantic and intimate . we ordered

4 dee <unk> <unk> ! i love the <unk> burger so juicy and delicious , i ca n't keep my lips off it ! they have a pork sandwich that is to die for . i have them cater to my office all the time . they have great potato salad
3 really ? seriously ? sarah l. is the l for little pompous ? where is your hood , north snottsdale ? unbelievable . how can you review a restaurant you did n't even eat at ??? from your review you just walked in had a beer , <unk> down your
1 well let me just say i did not go here on my own . dear sister raved and raved about it until i agreed to go with her . i will break it down like this , i thought there was to much on the menu yet nothing caught my
3 can you say <unk> ? why has oregano 's <unk> the west valley ??? we eat pizza too ! i am a little miffed that you can not find a good pie on the <unk> . peter <unk> piper , pizza <unk> , domino no 's , <unk> johns and
1 my people , my people , my people . freddy 's is a <unk> ! it is a knock off of the midwest darling steak and shake and they are famous for <unk> ! it burns my buns that they <unk> steak and shake . if you have ever had
2 solid deli . nice people , food is good not great .
1 went for saturday lunch . they were closed ? wait - a big restaurant in high rent north scottsdale is closed for lunch on a saturday with perfect weather for sitting on their patio ? i 'm impressed that there are still people left in this economy in a position
3 smack in the middle of the most touristy place in scottsdale , sola has enough <unk> to run this most <unk> of coffee houses . next time you 've had it with all the rental cars and out of <unk> on scottsdale rd. , indulge yourself in some real entertainment
2 so as not to bore you with the same info you can find in the other reviews , i 'll keep it brief . davanti has exceptional food . why only 3 stars ? two main reasons : 1 -rrb- being located smack at the gateway to paradise valley creates
4 after doing the math , it turns out i 've been coming to chino 's for 16 years , but until yesterday i could never put my finger on why i love it so . chino 's appeals to me , and <unk> turns many off , because they know
1 strange layout that makes you think you got the worst table in the house no matter what table you 're at . wait staff and the general manager -lrb- wtf ? -rrb- standing around doing nothing in a mostly empty restaurant while customers wait and wait . it all comes
4 got ta love a liquor store with shopping carts ! seriously , this place is perfect because it 's so easy to find what you want and they have a ton of inventory - more than bevmo for sure . the aisles are clearly marked with the type of wine
2 sunday brunch at c 's k gave us very , very good service but disappointing food . this was my second time eating there - last time was brunch too - and i really enjoy the wait staff who are both friendly and very good at what they do .
1 i 'm not going back to tammie coe for a while ... really . my co-workers and i have been making a habit of grabbing lunch from tammie coe . it 's so close to our office , and we 've been enjoying the sandwich of the day and an
4 dinner at sens was , hands-down , one of the best <unk> we 've had here in phoenix . four of us -lrb- 2 couples -rrb- made reservations at sens for 6:30 on a saturday night . it was a good thing we had reservations , because shortly thereafter ,
3 my friend , heather , and i had a lovely dinner at 1130 on saturday night . we made unnecessary reservations -lrb- do n't you just hate that - you make a reservation and the place is empty ?? -rrb- for 5:45 pm because we were seeing atc 's enchanted
3 let me be honest . i 'm kind of a snob . maybe that 's a dramatic statement to make , i do n't know ... all i can say is i never had an interest in going to the old willo house , which to me looked like a
4 one of my all time favorite spots in phoenix ! the best things at the arrogant butcher are the polish fix and the pretzel rolls with fondue . my friends and i dream about the polish fix . perfectly crushed ice , lemon juice , <unk> raspberries , and vodka
3 i generally enjoy buca di beppo ! i am fascinated by how this place is decorated . all the walls and various trinkets make this a fun dining experience or interesting at the very least . one thing to note is that it can be kind of expensive to eat
4 oregano 's is probably my favorite restaurant in arizona so far ! i love that they serve chicago style pizza ! the restaurant is very unique and it makes for a very neat place to dine at even though it can be hard to get a table at times and
4 wow , thanks to yelp i would have never stopped into this place . i never find myself in this area much and would not have gone out of my way unless i read some great reviews on yelp first . so i bookmarked it tuesday and 2 days later
4 do n't eat the food in the cafeteria here but i have got to tell you about the boat repair -lrb- <unk> -rrb- department . holy cow we have been taking our crappy old <unk> boat to these guys and every single time they have been so fair and reasonable
4 the nicest movie theater i have ever been to , i thought i was in a club and everyone dressed the part . the cost was pricey ... i would not take the kids to a movie here but it is a great date night . i paid for regular
3 wow , i was surprised how good this burger was . truthfully i tried going to in and out but the line was around the building so i decided to give culvers a try . glad i did , the burger was greasy but juicy and full of flavor .
3 i like that we have a sports venue in the west valley , i think that this place has tons of more potential but under the current recession it will take time to recover and get the growth we need all around this place . i love that <unk> is
4 just went to the pirate exhibit this weekend and i want to write a review because it was by far the coolest one yet . i have been to the body exhibit , the <unk> exhibit and others there . of course there is more to do there than just
4 came here again yesterday with my family and since my son is sensitive to many things the manager came out and asked us exactly what he was allergic to in order to make something custom just for my son . he was so accommodating that i just had to write
2 the atmosphere was great , this whole area in the scottsdale quarter is pretty cool . the front door to this place is deceiving and we almost walked right by it . i was not impressed by the sushi , would n't say it was bad but i nothing stood
4 my favorite restaurant . the food is always perfect . service is great , atmosphere excellent . the orange chicken with the five vegetable fried rice is my favorite meal anywhere ! they will email you specials and coupons if you sign up . for dessert , the berries <unk>
3 i really love pita jungle and this is really convienent right inside the mall ! they have great salads and sandwiches as well as hummus . i have tried several things now and i have n't had a bad item yet ! while the <unk> location is 5 stars ,
4 i have been a regular at frost now for over a year . the quality is consistently perfect . the service is always fast and friendly even when there is a line out the door in the middle of 100 degrees . they always bring around water to everyone sitting
3 first visit here was on a saturday at 7 with a group of 10 for a birthday . we had a table in the upstairs section which was really nice . they allowed us to bring balloons and <unk> and other decorations and set the table up before the guest
4 finally had a chance to try <unk> . if you go through my old reviews , you 'll see that sol y sombra was my absolute most favorite restaurant in the valley until it <unk> closed . this made me muy <unk> . sol y sombra 2 - aka <unk>
4 since they made these theatres `` amc dine-in '' theatres , it 's my favorite place in the phoenix area to see a movie . it 's nice , upscale and you pick your own seats . the stadium theatres are the way to go . they 're large ,
3 rest assured , if you need anything and you 're in scottsdale , you can find what you 're looking for at fashion square mall . this place is larger than most suburban cities , and probably has an operating budget that would make a <unk> blush . if you
2 came here recently and it had been a while , so we were pretty excited . we sat down and noticed it was a new menu ... a new menu devoid of some of our favorite dishes , with higher prices and less selection . fail . they took off
2 i really like their boneless wings and the service at lunch is pretty good and quick enough . that 's why it 's three stars . be warned ... if you come here when it 's busy , you 'll receive awful service . it 's slow , spotty -lrb-
3 who does n't love red robin ? this location is really close to my house , so it 's great for those quick dinners when you do n't feel like cooking -lrb- and lets be honest , that 's all the time -rrb- . the burgers and chicken tenders -lrb-
3 the lodge has been a pretty consistent happy hour spot for me over the last year and a half . their food and drink specials are a great way to wrap up the week on a friday night . i like their chicken strips and the cheese curds are great
4 my partner and i just moved downtown and the roosevelt has become our hang-out . i love this place . the staff is so friendly , genuinely friendly . they are also knowledgeable about wine and we have had some amazing bottles . the food is also excellent . my
0 i 've eaten here three times . the first two times were outstanding . the third time was not a charm . the food was almost inedible . our first course was a dumpling dish that had so much wasabi in it that i was in physical pain trying to
1 no . i just do n't dig this place . maybe because i 'm a vegetarian , and there are only , like , two things on the menu i can eat . their veggie sandwich has this <unk> spread on it that does n't strike my fancy .
4 ok , lem me get this straight . a vegan restaurant , on my side of town , and it 's delicious ?!? it 's like a dream come true ! i had the golden soy chicken delight and it was wonderful . thin slices of `` chicken '' in
2 the times i have actually purchased something at buffalo are few and far between . it seems like a good idea , but the deals really are n't that good . in the many years i have been visiting the store they have lost their genuine eclectic feel in exchange
3 i really dig chompie 's new location in pv mall . much nicer than the dated <unk> murals and design of the old 32nd street location . chompie 's is always my standby when i feel like having breakfast for dinner . last night i treated myself to some delicious
2 do not go here if you are already drunk ! they will take advantage of you ! a couple weeks ago , my husband and i did a mill ave pub crawl . this was stop # 3 -lrb- i know - it 's not really a `` pub ''
3 i 've been here a few times on date nights , and love it . we have only been here once when a comedian was so bad there was <unk> , but he was one of the starting acts . all the others were hilarious . we 've seen gabriel
4 i want to permanently live at my new favorite stay-cation destination !!! at checkin , i was asked which room location i would like -lrb- all of which came with a balcony ! -rrb- - my choices included - pool view , <unk> view , quiet buildings , those located
4 i love this place !!! amazing wine list that changes frequently , great food , fun atmosphere - what more could you ask for ??? the bruschetta are to die for !!! prosciutto , marscapone cheese and figs are <unk> h 's favorite . i could eat an entire plate
3 i have never actually eaten in the restaurant - just take out . i love the caprese salad , the plentiful antipasto salad , and the <unk> pizza . the pesto pizzas are delish as well . this is perfect thin crust pizza - not that doughy pizza . such
3 not going to lie , i thought the place was closed when we walked up to it . it 's not exceptionally well lit on the inside and the outside is adorable but misleading . anyway , the inside is very chic . a heavy red <unk> on the walls
3 as if the atmosphere in the hotel valley ho was n't already fantastic , this little area near the hotel ' lounge and bar area is understated and upscale at the same time . i went for happy hour and truly enjoyed the options . i went with the zuzu
2 i had a late dinner here after a happy hour in scottsdale . i had heard such high reviews from several people about the atmosphere , the food , the drinks , everything . i like <unk> a lot , especially of the irish decent . they 're an <unk>
4 this place is very cool . after having dinner at humble pie and seeing all the hype going on over at this little joint , i knew i had to check it out . grabbed lunch with my <unk> here mid afternoon on a friday . it 's an entirely
3 i went here to grab some drinks before heading to <unk> for the night . usually when you think of grabbing drinks some place before you go to get drinks some other place , you picture going to a dive bar or doing shots in someone 's kitchen . everywhere
3 total tempe staple . and so it should be . i went on a very hot sunday afternoon and although the wait was ridic we sat at the bar and drank mimosas . i thought $ 4 was a decent price until i saw the glass she served them in
2 very cute interior and the staff could not have been friendlier . they were so pleasant ! craving a sandwich of some kind , i went here on a friday afternoon . i 'd read a few reviews prior to going so i was expecting to be little disappointed in
2 it 's hard to keep up with all of the new pita jungles in the valley , but i 'm doing my best to make it to each one . today was the day for me to finally try the fashion square jungle location and it did not disappoint !
3 i 've heard from several people that wally 's is like a phoenix landmark ... it 's been around for awhile and they supposedly have a great happy hour ! crazy that in my 3 years in phoenix , today was my first visit to wally 's , but it
3 nourish is one of those places i recently found that i 'm hesitant to share on yelp because i <unk> do n't want them to get so crowded that i 'll have to wait for a table when i go ... a friend of mine who lives in the optima
3 it 's all about the chicken salad ... i know that those people that reviewed zoe 's before me were not the biggest fans . however , i think that zoe 's is a perfect place to go if you are looking for a healthy casual lunch . everything is
3 i recently revisited coach house for the yelp in bloom after party , so it 's time for an update and fresh in my mind ... and after reading my original review , my husband kindly informed me that coach house did indeed remodel several years back . they added

4 visit # <unk> to arcadia farms ... since my last update over a year ago , i 've literally been to arcadia farms way too many times to count -lrb- which is why i will estimate <unk> total visits above -rrb- . i 've never once had a bad meal
4 it 's hard to believe that it took me this long to get to fez ... better late than never though ! i felt a very cool energy when i entered for the first time . thomas was welcoming of course , but service was friendly , and the music
3 i 've been to caf zuzu a handful of times now ... mostly for drinks , once for dinner , and most recently for breakfast . i 've never been disappointed and i 'm sure i 'll continue to be a frequent customer , especially since i 'm now living
3 my first ethiopian experience in az . . jared 's first ethiopian experience ever ! friday night - no food in the house - i throw around ideas of places to go , jared <unk> them ... this is how the evening started . but somehow i convinced him to
4 i am so happy we chose this place for january yelp office hours today ... we had a great turnout , but better than that , i found my new favorite old town area coffee shop ! i started out with a hot peppermint tea , and a few hours
3 when i think of richardson 's , i feel warm and cozy inside . i 've been on several occasions and i love the atmosphere ... i always have a good time at this hidden little gem of the city . the ` cuisine of new mexico ' is unique

3 nice buzz + beautiful nails + garlic breath = how i feel after a monday night visit to furio for martinis and manicures . ok , so i really just went for the company but i happened to have 2 glasses of wine and a delicious dinner while i was
3 this place holds a special place in my heart ... it 's where i had my first date and first kiss with the bf . we may go back tonight to celebrate our 2 year anniversary ! as chris and <unk> said , greasewood flat is the perfect place to
2 wildflower is better than panera but still not my first choice for lunch . it 's on the same level as paradise bakery - maybe a tad nicer since they bring your food to you at your table . bread is fresh and homemade soups are decent as are the
2 i knew sweet tomatoes was a pretty major chain , and i 've visited other locations before , but i just learned that there are 112 restaurant locations in 15 states ... that 's pretty huge ! this location happens to be a lunchtime favorite for my friend kathy l
3 the <unk> -lrb- and shiny new door handles -rrb- that say `` come together '' could n't be more appropriate for beckett 's table ... last night was only their fourth night open , and i 'm giving them a solid four stars . the becketts and partners scott and

3 i 'd been eying total wine since their grand opening in july , and even more excited to go once i read brian s 's review ... i finally had a reason to go check it out - i was on a mission ... a mission for prickly pear margarita
2 3.5 stars ... it feels too much like a chain to be 4 stars , but it 's consistently good and conveniently located . i 've had sushi at ` the fish market ' on numerous occasions and ordered from the regular menu just once or twice . however ,
2 i 'm hoping that my visit to bertha 's was just on an off day ... i really wanted to like it - and maybe i had high expectations but should n't i since bertha 's has a 4.5 star average on yelp ? i 've been waiting for this
3 since i 'm * almost * the duchess of this aj 's location -lrb- watch out ben b -rrb- , it 's time for a review ... aj 's is the definition of a high-end , gourmet grocery store ... as mentioned in most of the other reviews , their
3 yes , it 's expensive , but it 's such a treat , and i have n't found another organic grocery in town that has the quality produce , salad bar , cheese selection , meats , seafood , etc. . . and it all tastes so fresh , healthy
3 the perfect place for hangover food ! i can not believe it took me so long to make my way to over easy ... but it was worth the wait for sure ! today i went to brunch at over easy with a party of 4 -lrb- that 's the

2 sorry , defalco 's - i have to take a star off for you always being so slow ! really , every time i 've been , there is a long wait - and your food is worth it , but is n't there a way for you to speed
4 homemade gelato , <unk> coffee , and now delicious salads , panini and wood-fired pizzas ... this g spot really has it all ! i was hesitant when i learned that the gelato spot in old town was coming out with pizzas and salads , but after my lunch there

3 if you blindfolded me and put me inside this modern , newly renovated space , i would never guess that it used to be cafe carumba or <unk> 's ! ok - maybe i would , but only because of the layout ... they did a great job <unk> and

4 pineapple <unk> pancakes and <unk> bacon . did i sell you yet ? do you even need to hear more than that ? oh my goodness . the pb & j french toast is something extra special too . excellent coffee , pretty much just a perfect breakfast location .
3 i love five guys . fast food fix , coming up ! i get the little burgers because seriously , the regular two patty burgers are way too much for me . i love the five guys buns . okay , seriously , how do you write a review of
4 it 's great that this location is open late on friday nights , but what 's more important is that it 's open by nine on saturday mornings , because lolo 's is up there for the award for the best hangover food i know . it might not sound
4 ordered the red velvet to take to a party and it was perfect . moist , delicious , balanced out exquisitely by the cream cheese frosting , everything a red velvet cake should be . they have other tempting flavors but those will have to wait for another day .
3 four stars for this wonderful little hole in the wall kind of place . the location is a little out of the way and i came in for lunch which is okay as there is a very varied crowd . from <unk> office workers to <unk> company <unk> types to
2 great pizza with fresh ingredients . but no <unk> taste as they claimed and the prices are a little on the high side for freshly made pizza . great service from our server , kind of made up for an overpriced appetizer of olive oil and bread .
3 great calzones , good pizza selections . their ambience is nothing to shout about if you are eating there . but i am more concerned about taste so its fine , we sat in their back area when they had renovations once . its like u are seated on the
4 great food , great service , very interesting menu with many many choices . price was decent , only complain might be the place is a little too small and gets busy very quickly . in fact , go there at opening time to get a seat and get served
3 another fun hangout place with good food . my group sat outside near the cornhole area . after eating the <unk> salmon -lrb- which i recommend ! -rrb- and ahi tuna salad -lrb- which was ... ok -rrb- , my friends and i played a couple rounds of the cornhole
4 yummy ! ordered a half size of the barcelona <unk> salad . half size was plenty for me . everything was very fresh . a great salad on a hot day . also tried that casablanca chicken sandwich . all the ingredients in the sandwich -lrb- chicken , pomegranate vinaigrette
3 2nd time coming here . i ordered the watermelon heirloom tomato salad . it was good because i like watermelon and tomatoes . . but for $ 12 for maybe 4 chunks of watermelon , yellow melon , tomatoes ... with basil , goat cheese , and cashews sprinkled around
3 many stores , eateries , and the harkins theater occupy tempe marketplace . there 's so much to do and see here ! only drawback i have is parking can get pretty crazy here on busy days and weekends . this is one of the coolest open-air shopping <unk> i
4 this was my second time seeing a concert here -lrb- saw the <unk> <unk> remembered show here 2 years ago & this time , it was for the <unk> -rrb- , and both times i have been very impressed . the venue is absolutely gorgeous and not a bad seat
2 tucked away behind historic buildings and located a couple hundred feet from the sight of the original phoenix china town stands a local restaurant that has been part of the city since the <unk> . for that reason , i think everyone should try this place at least once .
4 i went here with someone from work not expecting much , and holy cow , i was blown away . the pulled lamb is the best i 've ever had . -lrb- and it comes with a side of this delicious mint sauce stuff that is so good . -rrb-
3 i think i found my new favorite thai place , and it 's in walking distance to my house ! hooray ! i 've only tried the chicken pad thai . it was n't as sweet as other places but i do n't like things that are too sweet .
3 i had to ask how to pronounce the name . it 's pronounced `` <unk> '' . like an idiot , i was calling it <unk> . -lrb- i knew i was wrong , but still . -rrb- glad i got that <unk> out . if you 've seen any
4 there are so many great thai places in my neighborhood and this one can be added to the list . i went during their opening week and they had a screaming deal for a huge lunch special . it cost 7 bucks and some change and included a free drink
1 only tried on beef taco , but not too great . the shredded beef did n't seem shredded , it seems more mushy and chopped . the taco shell was crispy , but <unk> greasy at the bottom , which is typical , but this was too much grease .
3 this was the second time i visited for their late night happy hour . it starts at 8pm and includes a bunch of very good $ 4 appetizers and $ 3 well drinks and craft beers and $ 4 margarita 's . my food choices were two sliders on pretzel
4 tried the veggie pizza roll this time . this thing seemed bigger than usual as it filled the pizza box both length and height wise . the fillings were all pretty fresh including mushrooms , tomatoes and olives . no ricotta in a roll , but plenty of mozzarella cheese
2 nothing special here . only stopped inside because mexican place had closed down already next door . the sliced chicken breast wrap was average , good in a pinch , but nothing i would ever go out of my way for . it had semi sliced chicken heated with salsa
4 tickets to phoenix suns games are cheaper than the large beer in a cup at the arena . $ 10 tickets and $ 10.50 brews . i used to watch this arena on tv for years when the suns were good and i was living elsewhere . it seems less
3 situation is much better at 10am when the games begin . plenty of room at the bar and make sure you ask for the iowa <unk> breakfast menu . that menu contains the best deal in the house - the $ 9 breakfast burrito . i substituted bacon for sausage
2 partook in the half priced burger deal with purchase of a beverage which is in effect all day on saturday . the burger had to be sent back the first time -lrb- well a new one was made and old one was left in front of me -rrb- for being
2 went back the other night and the drink specials are still very good with most beers at $ 3 and craft beers as well . lost a star due to more food sampling . the green chile chicken sliders were hot as fire and nobody mentioned that fact . green
3 well , i rolled up around 5pm and there was plenty of street parking available . seems like a bunch of famous <unk> restaurants have been plopped down in residential areas - very strange . happy hour runs to 6pm only , so i slipped in three craft beers -lrb-
4 back to sample happy hour fare . the domestics were only $ 2.75 and the hh food menu is quite extensive . it also is one of the only happy hours that <unk> until 8pm . my food choice was the chicken skewers and these were solid if you like
3 second time here and i still have n't tried the burgers . they looked pretty decent coming out , but i do n't like the knife <unk> through the burger . i 'm too old school to cut my burger in half - please . this was a decent happy
3 the food is 4 stars , but i have been experiencing the worst gas i ever had , from the sauce they served on the protein bowl with chicken . to graphic , too bad ? i need to stay away from the thai coconut sauce and next time i
1 texting while making a salad is not appreciated . management has no control over staff who text while <unk> or not <unk> salad bar , texting while <unk> and who knows who else is texting . you also got that one big dude just standing over the bread area like

3 really enjoyed my pancakes here today . one of the better versions around . the blueberries were cooked into the pancakes and then for another 50 cents i added carmelized pecans . two of these things were enough , but they were good enough to get the full stack if
2 second time is never the charm . the rolled tacos are still good , but guacamole quality took a dive on this visit . i also tried a chicken tamale and that was inedible and rubbery . must have caught them on a bad night , but i think they
2 the fresh tortilla thing is pretty cool and the fact that they use all white meat chicken is a huge plus , but the chicken is not marinated as stated . not a huge fan of the mix all the ingredients together in the burrito before you roll it thing
2 these are authentic cheesesteaks , but i just realized that i 'm not a huge fan of the authentic style . in my perfect cheesesteak -lrb- likely outside of philly -rrb- , the meat and cheese and onions are folded in together to create more of gooey experience . actually
1 i went over here to try the breakfast burrito 's , but it appears that they do n't make you a fresh burrito every time you order . i just wanted eggs and beans and cheese , the $ 1.99 , but they were out of eggs ? they were
2 ok . i had two five dollar gift cards and decided to try some food and a beer . i still refused to order any of their thirty salads , but i did try the $ <unk> grilled buffalo chicken wrap and it was better than expected , but still
0 another disaster . <unk> food in an even <unk> area of phoenix . i have to start with the fact the they will not refund your money once you pay for something . so in my case , i ordered a famous apple burger extra well done to go with
3 ok , i admit that i thought this actually was a real farmer 's market , but even though it is n't , it really is one . the reason why i felt that way is because i purchased goat cheese - the form of cheese that only looks correct
1 tried out the happy hour at about 4pm on a weekday and place was empty . the bar is small inside and there is no bar outside . they have decent drink prices as i scored a domestic draft for 2 bucks . they have a bunch of food choices
3 open till late on saturday . happening on weekends . great for big crowds and also for a couple
3 best pizza in phx ! if you are craving great pizza at a nice little place in phx , <unk> is the place for you . my guy and i are food fanatics and he loves italian so he was recommended by an italian colleague to try this place .
2 do you like being entertained by a <unk> asian chef cooking at your table while you eat ? if this may sound interesting , grab a group of friends and check this place out . just do n't expect the food to be stellar , and if you order sushi
4 quite simply , the best .
4 this place proves that southwestern cuisine is not dead and there 's still room for lots of creativity . foodies and wine connoisseurs alike will enjoy just about everything on the menu . definitely order the chopped salad and let that begin the journey to an evening of culinary excellence
1 ok ... i 'm not getting the hype . the problem i had was that with everything good , came something bad . - menu : huge selection of basic <unk> italian food . the pizza is definitely the highlight , problem was that it was too huge , including
1 not pleased . yes , they have good portions . yes , its cool they deliver and are open til 930 every night . yes , the receptionist can speak english , which is not a <unk> comment , just a general fact after calling literally 7 chinese restaurants who

4 i had one of those <unk> discounts via deal chicken . good thing i did . with a $ 100 value , did n't get much . my daughter was still hungry and i was mildly `` full . '' i loved what we ordered , but my daughter did
2 first the good : local breeze patio caf has a wonderful patio , exceedingly friendly and prompt service , and some absolutely amazing house-made breads . nom nom nom . but it 's that `` patio caf '' thing that gets me . if this were a diner full of
1 the food 's good , the beer 's usually good , the brewmaster 's awesome . if i could rate a restaurant just on those criteria , it would easily be a 4-star joint . but this rock bottom location has a chronic , <unk> problem : the service .
1 hello again my fellow arizonians ... i am back and ready to review <unk> deli ... ... i will start by saying the pastrami is pretty darn good ! the meat is seasoned well and does have that ny pastrami taste ... however ... -lrb- and i know you knew
4 ok ... here it is from the girl who is very picky and can usually find problems with quality or price of food ... went to five guys for the first time ... i am proud to say i could not find anything that could have been improved on !
4 love their nachos and chicken rolled tacos ! awesome place !
4 where to start ... i love this place . i really really love their bread and salad . i have not had anything there that i did n't like . this place is my now go-to italian place .
3 i 've always been a fan of their happy hour . ca n't go wrong with their drink specials ! i 'm a huge fan of their pork gyoza and edamame . great for lunch too ! ironic , since i hate all sea food , this is one of
3 i have n't had a lot of sushi in the valley . so if i 'm being totally <unk> for phoenix , go ahead and let me know ... i was incredibly excited to find hana and have it actually be good sushi and near my hood ! our server
4 palatte makes me dislike phoenix a little bit less each time i go . i 've been here probably 6 or 7 times in my year here in phoenix . i 've sampled their <unk> dishes , the oatmeal , the yogurt , the scones , and always their coffee
4 so now that i 'm working from home amidst traveling , i have basically turned lux into my makeshift office . i just have to say for the record , that i think their espresso gets better every single time i 'm there . or maybe i just fall in
3 i had read jason c 's review of this place . a detailed account of why cibo = heart break for him . funny , sad , etc. . but i thought i 'd put a different twist on it since i 'm not looking to leave anyone any time
2 oh how i wanted this to be a 5 star experience , unfortunately it was not . the restaurant is small and cozy which i like . i also like the dcor , some of the art on the walls was absolutely gorgeous and the ambient music is good -lrb-
4 i ca n't believe i have n't reviewed jade palace before ! my husband and i go there often and love it . we 've been living in the area for 5 years and jade palace was one of the first restaurants we found that we both really liked .
3 fate is a great downtown spot . the servers are down-to-earth , the food is great , and best of all , it 's open late ! the lack of late-night joints in this city is horribly depressing . it 's sad to read other reviews of fate being such
3 i have had much last chance experience over the last couple of years . i hate it , but i am addicted nonetheless . i 'll admit , it 's always a terrible experience , but leaving with that <unk> johnson leather handbag that <unk> for over $ 400 ,
3 so this is the thing , my hubby is a vegetarian . we recently found out that carolina 's puts lard in everything . <unk> . every single item on their menu contains lard ... bummer ! especially because they 've been selling us `` vegetarian bean burritos '' for

3 i love love love this place . if i could afford it , i would eat here more often . the sandwiches are fabulous . best ingredients out there and amazing breads . you can also pretty much <unk> anything you want to any sandwich . the soups are always
3 this review is based solely on costco 's `` food court '' -lrb- or whatever you would like to call it -rrb- . i do n't think you can beat a $ 2 slice of pizza the size of your head . or a giant serving of nonfat frozen yogurt
2 my husband treated me to the steakhouse of my choice for mother 's day this year . i 've already been to ruth 's chris and durant 's several times so i thought i would take a leap and go with mastro 's . first off , we ended up
3 i have passed by this restaurant many times visiting tempe market place . i am quite upset that i did not venture in sooner . this place is wonderful ! as we walked in we were greeted by very friendly staff members , and were seated right away . it
3 mmmmmm mmmmmmm good ! this is a tiny place with a long wait ... so if you just want a regular old pizza in a couple minutes , you wont be happy visiting this restaurant . this restaurant is quite famous and everyone has wonderful things to say about it
2 if i was a beer lover this place would be a cool place to visit , for they have over 100 beers on tap ! since im allergic to beer i came here for the food ! lol ! the ambience is nice and relaxing . the dim inside lighting
4 been meaning to write a review for years ... we eat here at least 3-4 <unk> . the best tacos . ever . and , yes , my wife is from <unk> and we travel extensively throughout mexico -lrb- on the economy , not the tourist spots -rrb- and after
1 they only get 2 stars for the food , which is really pretty good . their service -- i 'd give them less than <unk> - if i could . at best : a bunch of disinterested young kids sitting around <unk> or wandering around <unk> doing their best not
1 i went to their <unk> , il location many , many years ago with my dad for pancakes . i recall that the pancakes were good . tried the scottsdale location today . they were packed , but we were seated within 5 minutes . service was extremely fast .
4 went back to kobalt last thursday for trivia night and i 'm telling you this place is a blast . trivia cost $ 5 per team . bring 5 people on your team you guys only put in $ 1 each . you can win over $ 100 the questions
4 i went to chompies tonight with valley movie group of <unk> this is the first time i 've ever been to chompies and i could n't wait to run home and tell you how <unk> ! my sandwhich was . i ordered the aaron 's choice which is hot corned
3 it 's deliciousness every time i come here . i ordered the chicken satay which came with the tastiest cucumber salad . i had to order another cucumber salad it was so good . it was only $ 2 extra . they give you six skewers of chicken , so
2 if i still smoked weed -lrb- okay , if i was high -rrb- this place would be fucking heaven . random mixes of spicy food that 's not that great for you , fried stuff with cheese all served in a goddamn <unk> pan . as everyone i know either
1 i was stoked to see this place opening . finally , late night food in a cool atmosphere when i could hang out with friends , have an after dinner drink or just look cool . eh ... not so much . the menu is extremely limited , the decor
2 i want to love this place . i really do . but i just ca n't . sure , the food is pretty good , service is fairly quick and the people seem nice enough , but i have no idea how this place can function as a restaurant .
3 i brought my sisters here after i purchased a groupon . i 'm glad that it came up on groupon because i never would have known about this place . yum food - served any way you want it . everything can be customized to your desires .
4 my husband and i brought my nephew here for something fun to do . what i really enjoyed about the place is that it 's pretty hands-on and caters to kids -lrb- but is still pretty fun for us adults too -rrb- . i came in here thinking that my
3 this place is fun and unique . the flavors are different than a baskin robbins or coldstone - mostly because of the way that it 's made . for instance - the mint ice cream is literally mint - like with mint leaves in there ! definitely worth a try
2 although my previous experiences were 5 star experiences , lately , the breakfast joynt has been disappointing . very disappointing ... today 's breakfast broke the camel 's back , so to speak : for the second time i had to send my eggs back due to <unk> cooking ,
1 here is what we ordered : ham and eggs and steak and eggs . both came with toast and fresh fruit . i ordered the ham and eggs , and ordered my eggs `` over well '' and asked the waitress to have my <unk> popped , because the sight
2 i 'm not giving up on this restaurant , and neither should you , but a <unk> experience was n't so perfect as the first . i ordered the same sandwich -lrb- turkey pastrami -rrb- because i was dreaming of it , and unfortunately , it came on a regular
4 milagro grill was a total and wonderful , surprise ! when you drive into the strip center where it is located , you notice a rather large patio -lrb- which is covered -rrb- , with several tables , sofa 's and misters to cool you off . upon entering the
3 i love this place . great breakfasts , lunches and dinners . their pastrami is the best in the state , and their turkey that is used in sandwiches tastes real -lrb- as in not the watery deli stuff you find in most places -rrb- . they did get rid
3 the building , ambiance , and interior are gorgeous , warm and relaxing . it 's a much cozier restaurant than the old houston 's on camelback . the menu is much the same , thankfully . we started out with the grilled artichoke and it was good -lrb- it
4 everything about the stand is delicious . everything . everything at the stand is fresh ... right down to the homemade lemonade . the staff ? friendly , helpful , and welcoming . i usually get the standard with cheese -lrb- two <unk> patties , fresh lettuce , tomato ,
2 this is a difficult review . the food was good -lrb- the burgers were really good -rrb- and the place should be full of patrons because of it . oddly , we were the only people in the restaurant . besides the two servers who could have cared less that
3 butters is close to my office so i must say in this review i 'm a bit biased because they are so convenient for lunch and always get my to go order ready really quickly . my <unk> are either the cobb salad with honey mustard or the california chicken
4 absolutely love this place . 5 stars through and through . my boyfriend and i came on valentine 's day this year and the service was excellent as well as the food . that night , we wanted to go all out so we each ordered our own steak and
4 the other night was my first visit to this gem ! my first thought as i came in the door was how good the food smelled ! it is small and you are served at long tables or at the bar . part of it 's charm is you never

4 i had been meaning to try vincent 's for such a long time , and today was the day . so many people had mentioned how lovely the brunch menu is here ... i am happy to say that we have found our new favorite breakfast / brunch destination !
3 now in downtown phoenix , just as great .
3 met a group here for dinner , expecting to try the vegan burger but opting instead for the vegetarian chili . the `` vegetarian chili '' arrived in an enormous bowl -lrb- think mini <unk> -rrb- and consisted of a thick layer of cheddar cheese , mixture of mashed potatoes
3 great fresh food . had a grilled peanut butter and banana split sandwich for a snack , it was really good . would like to try the place again .
4 this is how caribbean food should be done . excellent jerk chicken , perfectly cooked plantains , very good patties . i highly recommend this place if you are at all a fan of caribbean food .
4 this was my first time trying indian food , so i can not really compare the experience here to any place else . however , i do know when something tastes good , and that was certainly true here . i echo the sentiments of other reviewers with respect to
4 pricey but outstanding ice cream . worth the money . try the bacon brittle .
3 great bruschetta , and the atmosphere is quite nice . i would like to try lunch here , as the dinner crowd was a little loud for my taste -lrb- must be getting old -rrb- .
3 only tried their takeout , but very good food . a little pricey , would like to try to eat in at some point .
3 `` <unk> , matt <unk> !! '' ahh , just those three little words bring my tastebuds to <unk> as i can completely visualize the guedo chicken burro -lrb- has a very unique sauce that you wo n't find anywhere -rrb- closely nestled up against a steak taco with cheese
3 yay ! <unk> finally knows how to brew an iced mocha with <unk> milk that is n't completely bitter . like , really , how hard can this be . now do n't get me wrong i do like fair trade , but the only mocha i can get there
3 somehow i 've always been disinterested in fox restaurants , expecting a <unk> experience . unlike your neighborhood applebee 's , arrogant butcher feels like a cool hangout spot it 's <unk> corner to us airways stadium , go suns ! huge patio , great for <unk> back . the
3 really cool cocktails and sweet potato fries ?! have been taking friends here for happy hour because we always have a fun time . the bar is lined with tiki cups of all shapes and sizes . there 's even a drink that comes with a <unk> ? kinda weird
4 i hear that in china , people can be very pushy , even rude , by american standards , shouting across a dining room , ordering their servers around . do n't worry , no such behavior will be necessary here . all the servers are speedy and attentive .
4 i hate and love this place . i always go for one thing -lrb- usually treats for the dogs -rrb- but end up buying 4 or 5 other things . ground beef with bacon for burgers , jalapeno cheese brats , bacon <unk> filets ... so many choices ... and
0 worst wings ever !! how can they be so disgusting ?? i got sick after trying to eat two wings . and by try , i mean i took the skin off to allow all the grease to drain , yes drain , from under the skin before taking a

0 i wish i was rating this place higher . however , lack of follow through from management leaves me no choice . quick review : got a big group ? do n't bother calling and setting things up with <unk> . you 'll feel like <unk> citizens . it 's

0 have been here a couple of times , not by choice . i thought the place was pretty filthy for a restaurant ... actually it was pretty filthy for a <unk> gas station restroom . bugs all over the floor , dirt , <unk> and a smell . the food
2 kona grill is one of my go to for happy hour with my husband and friends . my favorite is the avocado egg rolls but i often get veggie rolls with tempura flakes and eel sauce . yum ! but even if you just go to have a drink at

4 love , love , love this place . the food is excellent - especially the pork shoulder dishes . the services is quick and friendly . and the owner who we met at my birthday was a delight . i highly recommend this `` hidden '' gem .
4 holy waffle sundae ! love this place . the wait , as with every place in scottsdale , sucks . but the food and service were outstanding . the waffle sundae was excellent as was the chicken wrap .

1 i 'll probably be stoned to death and lose my pink card for this review , but i 've given bliss a chance three times and was sorely disappointed all three . from inconsistent service , to <unk> food choices , i just ca n't go into the <unk> food
4 i ca n't say enough good things . every thing you 've read in other reviews is true . great service and sublime food . we were a group of 8 and the waiter gave everyone equal attention . we ordered the fritters and the pretzel bites for appetizers .
3 let me start off by saying that i 've never been a fan of fez . and let me now clarify that and say that i 'm not a fan of the food , but i 'm a fan of the service and the professionalism . i 've never had
4 we had to stop by the apple store to replace my phone so we decided to head to cpk for lunch . it 's been quite sometime since my boyfriend and i both had been to one so it sounded like a good idea . we got seated right away
4 i stumbled across yen sushi about a 11/2 years ago and it 's one of my favorite places . the first time i went i wanted to just get takeout and i did over order but it was amazing ! the second time i actually ate at the sushi bar
2 <unk> tail is pretty good & the jerk chicken has a nice flavor but the prices are a little expensive for what you get . this place ai n't no fancy dinner option ... it 's more like a good place to stop for a quick lunch . the portions

3 i went to beckett 's table on a wednesday night with the fabulous aileen b. i was dying to try this place because she made my mouth water after reading her review . the pictures that on on yelp do not do this place justice . it is alot bigger
2 chips and salsa are pretty taste and free . service was just ok as there was only one poor guy trying to take care of about 10 of us . also you can not order happy hour in the dining room only at the bar and you can not order
3 me and my friend jill were trying to figure out what we were going to eat at our annual fall picnic and we decided to grab some sandwiches over at cheba hut . all i can say is wow , very interesting place . as a few other reviewers have

3 i 've never been in , but our team at work often gets these for birthdays . they are so large , we typically split them in half so everyone gets to try two different flavor . i 've tried the cinnamon sugar , chocolate , red velvet , spice
2 this place is solid . nice <unk> , except it was a bit empty during weekday happy hour after work , and the bathroom has that terrible fake gold paint that seems like it was slapped up in the dark . the food was solid . i had some sushi
4 i agree with all of the good things already said by other reviewers , and so will you . i was a <unk> during yelp eats and got to try a variety of the best dishes ... teeter tots -lrb- delicious fried morsels in just the perfect sauce -rrb- ,
3 too cool for school ! you would n't know it from the street , but there 's a really sleek restaurant inside that adds another <unk> notch to this town for me . dark but cozy in a modern way . the food was good as well . we shared
3 love going to this place for breakfast for a few reasons . 1 -rrb- it is not a chain restaurant ! 2 -rrb- the portions are insanely huge and the prices are great ! 3 -rrb- the food is awesome . 4 -rrb- all of the servers have worked here
4 went here for lunch with some coworkers last week . this place is adorable ! i love when they turn old houses into little restaurants . i had the <unk> sandwhich -lrb- prosciutto , lettuce , and tomato -rrb- . it had a spicy roasted red pepper <unk> on it

4 the yelp rating is what made me drive out of my way to pickup a late lunch . if i were just driving by this shop i would have never stopped . i ordered a three taco plate with three different tacos . i do not remember the names ,
3 i was hungry for gyro . i checked yelp and saw a place i had not heard of before . it is a nice market and restaurant . i wanted to sample a couple of menu items of my typical mediterranean cravings . gyro - lamb and beef and grilled
3 this is the place to go to grab a drink with out-of-town visitors , hands down . the restaurant is what it is , look to spend over $ 100 a person and stop at mcdonald 's on the way home to fill up . if you have the money
4 finally , a 5-star breakfast joint in a city that up until now has n't wowed me with the morning food . wy-knot fits right in with the other restaurants in its 7th street stretch , perfectly delivering its <unk> and homey ambiance . most importantly , the people who
3 although not even close to my first choice for phoenix pizza , i was n't at all disappointed with humble pie . as i remember it , the pizza was great and they had enough beers on tap to make me happy .

4 hidden gem . and this gem shines bright -lrb- literally , it 's got tons of fancy blue light oozing out through the doors and windows -rrb- . good evening , downtown phoenix , it 's past 10pm and there 's still a place to go . the reverse happy
2 the place was pretty good , falling just slightly short of my expectations . it 's got a good location in old town , and being <unk> i bet its awesome after a good night out drinking . the meat was a little bit tough , but overall not too

3 i was looking for a good diner , went to trusty yelp , found harlow 's , sorted by elite ... mark d 's review had me at `` bad girl . '' looks like harlow 's could be a good impromptu uye lunch spot or hangover recovery hq .

3 save money ! eat at lolo 's ! go here for an early lunch and you are set for the day ! perhaps a small snack 6-8 hours later but that 's pretty much it ! my second visit to lolo 's did n't quite measure up to the first
4 <unk> is a welcome addition to the valley . i do n't care for casinos and the <unk> that seems to <unk> them . but once you pass through the smoky crowds and in to <unk> , you are in a different place . for new construction , they managed
2 mikado really surprised me . i did n't expect to find a japanese restaurant so close to home with a nice atmosphere and pretty good food ... but here it is ! sushi is really the thing here . the tempura is good although the shrimp tempura had an odd
3 i always thought it would be cool to have my own private compound . you know , kind of like the `` <unk> compound '' that our former <unk> had . except i would let google maps display mine ... mostly because i do n't have the power to bend
2 i 'm not terribly familiar with vietnamese cuisine so consider this review from a slightly <unk> palate when it comes to the cuisine . my oldest daughter and i decided on saigon pho because we were in the mood for something different . i was not impressed with the atmosphere
2 here we have an island themed restaurant in the <unk> of tokyo joe 's and others . i tried a pulled pork sandwich with `` rumbi fries '' which are regular pencil fries mixed with <unk> cut sweet potato fries . the pork was pretty good , could have been
3 . sandwiches and capriotti 's steak i am one of still full i had 4 hours later . i guess it 's a medium . good thing not the that i ordered sandwich the small filling and delicious but not for the faint of heart . <unk> . mmm ,
4 what 's not to like ?? this place is absolutely awesome and is quickly becoming one of phoenix 's <unk> kept secrets . i tell everybody about this place . it may be a bit difficult to find for the first time - it 's is in a very non-descript
2 downtown phoenix is certainly in need of trendy restaurants like the blue hound . it has an industrial meets <unk> type of atmosphere . there are chandeliers in cages , plank floors and rustic wood tables - and it all works nicely together . that said , there is nothing
4 bistro classic pizza ... yum yum ! and the <unk> are the best .
3 have n't been to this place in a couple of years so was totally surprised when we walked in the door . they have completed remodeled since our last visit - from <unk> and pub-like , to open , bright and modern . three of our group ordered the firecracker
2 alright , so i 'm ok with this place . the lady was nice ... kind of . we had a young baby and she wanted to seat us in the middle of the room ... not a good idea . 1 person running around + sleeping infant seat on
3 i really enjoy coming here for the happy hour/reverse happy hour . the staff is hit or miss , if you a have a good one then you will be well taken care of unfortunately if you have a bad one prepare to wait forever to even order . i
1 tonight i tested out the new loving hut . i grabbed some to go , and honestly it was n't as good as it had been previous times . : -lrb- while i did n't see any of the <unk> videos mentioned in more recent review than my last one

3 my 3rd review of a guy <unk> joint . . 2 here in phoenix metro and one in flagstaff . this is truly a little strip mall dive . walk up and order , <unk> seating -lrb- i.e. <unk> -rrb- , etc. . none of that is a bad thing
4 i love charleston 's . for a chain operation , it 's about as good as it gets , and that rates the coveted 5-star rating on the <unk>  . the menu is relatively short . i appreciate and respect this , as it means that the restaurant can
3 spicy pickle is a semi-regular lunch stop for me . it 's close to the office , and until last week , i could snag covered parking . no more , now all the formerly open spots are `` reserved '' . <unk> . i 've only had one thing
2 a coworker brought me here about a month ago and i was genuinely surprised when i walked into this place . it was pretty clean and colorful in everything you expect from a traditional mexican restaurant in the valley . plus , they had individual la rosa candy for sale
4 i will never drink another iced coffee unless it comes from royal at the market . ever . i promise . seriously . if my hot cup of coffee gets lukewarm , i 'll be forced to throw it away because then i 'd be cheating on you . and
1 on our friday lunch tradition , coworkers convinced me to come to this place . i was n't too crazy about it being a chain and all but gave it a shot anyway . upon entrance , it looks like chipotle added more red and now serves burgers . after
3 hakata ramen ... steal my heart with your delicious broth , nice pieces of pork , mushroom , scallion , noodles , topped with spicy pickled ginger . summer roll with crab mix , rice noodle , romaine , avocado and spicy ginger peanut dressing ... i love you ,
3 one of the most ironic things about this place is that it 's a stone 's throw away from pita jungle , yet they 're completely different restaurants . at haji-baba the exquisite architecture and the <unk> waitresses , do n't get <unk> into your bill . basically because there
3 this place gets very mixed reviews but let 's face it , you can get a burger for $ 2.95 and they will put all the fixings on for you as well as substitute a wheat bun , no charge . they also read your order back to you both
3 mention the burrito co. to anyone who is from or lives in ahwatukee and they know exactly what you are referring to . now that 's name recognition . centrally situated between tempe and the beginning of ahwatukee , <unk> , as i like to call it , is a
2 i 'm a regular here every sunday , if i do n't dine in , i take it to go . . but today , i felt as if i 'm a regular there , they do n't need to treat me as special anymore and that im always going
4 lauren knows us so well . every time were in here , she always help us . she literally ordered our food without us saying anything !! she is great : -rrb- -rrb- -rrb- -rrb- she 's so friendly and full of energy , love her personality we always get
4 service was quick -lrb- which boyfriend loves -rrb- and we got our ice creams , it was on point . i love how pink and girly this place is : -rrb- we came here after dinner , to continue our date night . we had one scoop of peppermint and
2 our first time here , my nephew and i . we walked in the bar side . lolz . i was so lost . haha great selection on the menu . the garlic <unk> banana bell pepper bread was awesome . : -rrb- -rrb- -rrb- -rrb- slow service . i
2 maybe my expectations were too high after i 'd heard so many good things about this place because i ca n't say i was blown away . the boyfriend and i are loyal fans of the farmhouse which is right next door . but we 'd been curious about their
2 here 's the thing about oph - i love it and i hate it . let 's start with why i hate it . 1 . there is always a long wait and they have a tiny waiting area so you end up waiting outside in the heat . 2
3 hit rnr for lunch with some co-workers this week . the atmosphere is very open and modern but not uptight which is always nice . it was not very busy so the 6 of us got a table right away . the menu had a nice selection of salads and
4 recently went to the tempe location and they now serve sides as well . yippee !
4 i love a good burger . i especially love a good grass-fed beef burger . since most places do not serve grass-fed beef i was excited to discover coal burger . if you do n't know , grass-fed beef is healthier than <unk> , for you and the cows !
3 never having been to el chorro before i was excited when my work announced that we would be having our holiday party there this year . it turned out to be a great choice . we are a decent sized company so we had a room to ourselves in the
4 this place is like half movie theatre , half <unk> museum . it 's worth going to just for the weird statues and creepy wax figures that stare at you from every corner . the movies are only three bucks so you ca n't beat that . the theaters themselves
2 in giving restaurant mexico 3 stars i wish i could change the rating of a-ok to <unk> . it 's not bad , it 's not great , it 's just eh -lrb- insert shrug here -rrb- ok . went there today with some co-workers . i 've been before
4 after reading all the rave reviews about blt steak 's happy hour i wanted to try it for myself . yelpers , once again you have not failed me . the rave reviews were spot on - this place is fantastic . boyfriend and i snagged ourselves a comfy spot
4 i 'm so happy that jimmy john 's has come to the valley . they offer good sandwiches at good prices . i have been to jj 's many times in <unk> and this jj 's is just as good . i went there for lunch today and the place
3 if there was one word to describe my experience at metro it would be - beignets ! but before i get to the best part , let me start at the beginning . the boyfriend and i decided to try metro after seeing their menu as part of yelp eats
3 this place is not that easy to find but i 'm glad i hung in there and found it because i really liked it . stopped in for lunch last week to try something new . when i walked in i was immediately greeted . the man behind the counter
4 ted 's is awesome . from the way they cook their dogs to the quality of their ingredients , you cant go wrong eating at ted 's . we always take people from out of town here and they all wish they had a ted 's in their town .
1 * not a good place for groups * i went to another location last mon and was super pleased , so when my friend said thats where we were going for her bday i was excited . never again . not to this location anyway . when it came time
3 good food , good drinks , decent prices . always packed on fri and sat nights .
3 my bff heard about this place from another friend , we decided to check it out last <unk> . awesome . their happy hour prices are super cheap . regular prices are about the same as anywhere else but the amount you get for it , is <unk> more .
3 a group of girls and i went there last night just for drinks , so this is a review of the bar only . our drinks were great . the male bartender , jimmy , was very helpful w / our <unk> and very nice . the girl bartender that
1 i had such high hopes for this place . firstly , it 's too small for fri and sat night crowds . it was literally elbow to elbow in there . it looked like they have some sort of balcony area above the bar -lrb- ? -rrb- , if that
3 $ 7.00 for a `` create your own '' pizza ? yes please . this is the only truck i havent tried that comes to the asu food truck block party . i never see a line there , so i was helped almost immediately . i ordered my pie
4 wow . just wow . what liz said . what jared said . what nearly everyone else has said . this place is fantastic . it may be a little hard to find . a white building w / no traditional signage , we only found it because of the
3 love love love this place . great speakeasy . the bartenders here are awesome , as is the atmosphere . try the house shot .
3 ive been wanting to come here for a while , so when we left another bar in the neighborhood and the question of `` where now ? '' came up , i jumped at the chance to try it . great beer list with lots of az brews as well
3 love their garlic fries and southwest egg rolls . their beers are pretty tasty as well . i usually opt for whatever their seasonal is -lrb- right its the <unk> - nice and light -rrb- .
2 ive never been a fan of teakwoods food , but they usually have good drinks specials . all i ask is that if you have a specific drink special , like say , four peak fridays list the beers that you have for them . somewhere . anywhere . on
2 the beer list here is great . seriously . if you like craft brews , go here . the food is meh . there are a lot of really interesting combinations , but the execution wasnt the best . the service is also meh . all 8 of us had
3 some of the best garlic bread ive had in a long time . their pizza was really , really good . our waiter was super nice and helpful . im looking forward to going back here and trying more of their menu .
3 delicious , cheap -lrb- for how much you actually get -rrb- , and oh yeah , delicious . i love this place . i easily take home enough food for 3 meals . great variety and nice people .
2 oh az mills ... where to start . parking : there is plenty of it . i find that the worst places to park are on either side of the movie theater or in front of <unk> . food : a pretty decent food court , as far as selection
4 my new favorite happy hour place ! the only downside is that the bar area is small and chairs are limited , so you 've got to come early and snag a spot before they 're gone . it really is worth rushing over ... half price drinks -lrb- black
4 best burgers ever . they 're not of the typical <unk> burger to chow down on variety , but ones that you want to savor , loving every <unk> bite . just when you think it could n't get better come along their fries . i could eat three orders
3 i do n't think i would have made it through some of my long days in the dance department at asu without a lunch from sacks . i have had sandwiches and salads alike at this fine establishment , hardly any of which have left me unsatisfied . the free
4 some of the best pizza i have ever had . i had the <unk> and walnut pizza and would eat it almost every week if i could . we went for my birthday and it was definitely a treat . we had a great bottle of wine , even tried
3 have you ever had a craving for a favorite kid food , but wished it could just have a little bit of a grown-up twist ? at the roosevelt , you can have just that . my favorite food here is the tomato soup and grilled cheese sandwich . it
4 <unk> 's is my favorite thai spot . its got great food , atmosphere service , and even a live band on some nights . its a fun place with awesome food . i have yet to be disappointed after countless meals .
3 i love spicy thai food and swaddee certainly didnt let me down . i feel like this is a great hidden gem in chandler , i would have never known it was there unless it had been pointed out to me . i have had a few favorites like green
4 ok , its in a strip mall ... but what isnt ? i absolutely love this place for indian food . the staff is friendly and the service is fast . the <unk> chicken melts in your mouth ! we seriously <unk> up every bit of the gravy with our
3 good specials and it does a nice job .
2 fun place to check out . great for after games , since it 's near where the baseball and basketball teams play . the sausage dog is yummy , but too much bread . great bloody mary bar on sundays . good place to watch sports . sometimes they have
3 great happy hour .
3 friendly staff . good prices -lrb- but not as good as on <unk> -rrb- . i love the fact that wild flower is next door and i can walk there from my house . oh ya , the most important thing . it does not have that moldy smell that
4 i am a huge hockey fan from michigan . so of course i have to go to see the red wings when they come to town . i was impressed with the arena . of course its not joe louis , but it was the right temperature and had adequate
3 little rough around the edges but the breakfast food is great . i have n't had dinner there yet but i will the next time in town .
1 food was great but crazy overpriced ... they just opened at 5:30 pm and we arrived at that time , the couple next to us arrived a couple minutes later and was told their order would take at least 90 minutes . why ? they just opened , so i
4 my new favorite stop in phoenix ! i love this place -- the iced mochas are spectacular ... and so far , the pastries have all been amazing ! so nice to find a place like this here in phoenix ... it reminds of the <unk> park neighborhoods in chicago
3 the gelato at gelato spot might be the best this side of the rio grande ! so many flavors and so little cardio that i do at the gym ... ugh . the gourmet pizzas are very good too . i am a fan of traditional -lrb- sausage and mushroom
2 i do n't see the allure to this place . my friends swear by the place , but i think it 's just meh . while my meal was not bad , i would not go back . i come from philly , the land of hoagies and sandwiches .
3 even if you do n't like to eat white chocolate , you must get the bread pudding . even if you are beyond full , you must get the bread pudding . it is that good . ask for it a la mode , it 's so worth it .
4 being in the mood for a vietnamese and wanting to try somethings out of our usual zip <unk> , peg and i made the maiden voyage to this wonderful mom and pop -lrb- actually , sis and sis -rrb- restaurant on saturday . being in the mood to try different
4 one of the few things that i do is yelp a restaurant on numerous occasions . because my yelps are almost exclusively positive -lrb- there have been on a couple of exceptions -rrb- then only if a restaurant falls down do i <unk> . happily , my <unk> old additional
4 great gelato , great selection and great people . what a special place . not to be missed !!!
4 after taking another couple to the pig 's brunch last sunday , i have been thinking about returning to the place for a specific menu item ... prime rib . i 'm usually an omnivore if the food is done well . i have not been shy about sharing the
3 <unk> 's is a tempe <unk> staple there are an overwhelming amount of options , enough to keep you coming back time and again the prices are decent and affordable , considering the quality and portions of food you receive their bakery is pretty phenomenal and the bagels & <unk>
4 okay so i know it must seem like i have a huge <unk> for sidebar and i do but i keep finding out so many awesome quirks about this place , that i feel must be shared mondays free mexican food , catered by ranch market ! omfg how awesome
0 next time i get the once in a blue moon urge to visit a casino , i 'm just going to take $ 20 out of my wallet and rip it in half .
3 just as delicious as all the hype warrants , and impeccably clean . this is hangover food at its finest . played <unk> from work and came here with a <unk> of a headache , like a <unk> <unk> hangover . lo-lo 's put the <unk> on that noise real
3 adjectives that come to mind when someone suggests tmi : charming . quaint . <unk> . <unk> . tmi represents the <unk> scene of cenpho well , and caters to the <unk> that other hip local business owners in our city have come to <unk> : namely - <unk> ,
1 i wanted to like this place , it has a lot going for it . - awesome location - perfect ambience - spot on decor - good standard irish pub beers on tap but sadly prices were a little high , and our bar tender wasnt very attentive a <unk>
4 five stars alone based on the grilled tofu salad and the pork belly buns this is one of the spots you have to visit on any down town pilgrimage , it 's simply one of the best restaurants phoenix has to offer .
1 rosita 's <unk> <unk> there is nothing to really say it 's not even that rosita 's is bad , it 's ... well ... i guess i expected more on account of it 's <unk> . the food here is mediocre , the service slow but friendly enough ,
1 two words : yogurt land suck it mojo !
2 sunday afternoon my brother and our friend scott rode our bikes on a massive <unk> tour and then to the sunup brewing co. for bunch . we 'd all been wanting to try out the place and sample their brews for a while . we arrived , and were told
4 this place is just magical . the garden has thousands of desert plants and <unk> that you 've never seen before or could imagine exists . it really takes you into a different world . the landscape goes on for miles , with all sorts of winding trails that makes
1 went here saturday night with my hubby , nothing special about this place . we were looking for a casual sit down place to have a late lunch/dinner . we remember seeing this places bbq sauce in stores , so thought they might have some tasty food . we got
2 food was ok , nothing i had really stood out . -lrb- chicken chimi meal -rrb- went here because of the <unk> coupon i had . food was heavy and well portioned . service was a little slow but it was saturday around lunch time . place is dark and
4 stopped in for some lunch last saturday . place was pretty packed because of the bbq fest that was going on the same day . that being said we did get seated right away . this place had such an inviting atmosphere . super laid back and a great selection
3 the service here is usually very friendly . the wait staff is n't incredibly attentive , but the wings are usually prepared well , and it 's certainly worth going for a good discount on wing tuesdays : wings then are 60 cents per . i prefer boneless , hubby
3 the service is always super friendly ! me and the husband are fans of this place because the burgers alone are so well-priced . it 's a great place to have lunch with friends with a classic burger menu .
2 i 'm not a big fan of gallagher 's overall , but that 's primarily because of what it is - a sports bar - which i tend not to frequent , for a couple of reasons : 1 . i do n't like sports , and 2 . they
4 this is n't south mountain , people . this is n't a damn nature hike . this is n't one of those trails where you wander along in <unk> and talk about the weather and take pictures and smell the flowers and all that shit . this is exercise .
4 had a wonderful dinner date here friday night . could n't believe there were n't more people than there were . only a few tables were occupied . it 's such a charming little place . the colorful walls and plentiful folk art create a really cool atmosphere . but
1 i like seafood . i like pizza . so i ordered the seafood pizza . big mistake . i had been waiting about 20 minutes for it when the waitress informed me that it did n't look good , and she 'd asked the cook to start over . it
3 woah talk about confusing , starting with the entrance - we walked in through the back door , right through the kitchen . . still not sure if that was actually an acceptable thing to do . nobody said anything if it was n't . then what ? looked around
2 it 's the little things i like about fatburger ... you know how most fast food places give you what - like , one packet of ketchup , maybe two - then give you that gluttonous pig look if you ask for more ? well , there 's a bucket
4 where i am from dogs are not allowed at farmer 's markets due to health code dealio reasons ... so it was a shock to see so many dogs around -lrb- scottsdale seems to be super pet friendly -rrb- . i had a blast sampling all the goodies ... lots
3 put on your mac makeup and your best jimmy choo stilettos because if you look a hot mess in this mall they know you are not a local !! i will raise lynn w 's valley fair to the following : if valley fair , certain areas of los angeles
4 you 'll pay a decent price for your meal but here 's how i see it . you might save a few bucks doing the fine dining thing elsewhere but you are missing the complete experience that t. cook 's has cornered . yes , the food is great ,
3 it 's the tiki room with rum and less <unk> . a great way around the `` higher prices '' is to <unk> the happy hour . you are able to navigate several decent dishes , the better ones being the duck and ribs , at a price that wo
3 the first couple of visits the menu might come off as a little insipid . do n't let that deter you because your tastebuds need time to detox from all of the fatty burgers you once consumed . you will soon find a menu full of dishes to feel good
3 the place you go to when you are not in the mood to deal with the surly crowds at bianco . great setting , good pizza , and excellent desserts .
1 this place loses another star for <unk> a <unk> valet service that prevents anyone from parking on 1st avenue who is looking to eat somewhere else like america 's tacos . i am baffled that valet service exists out here and that they can successfully block off more than half
3 sure you 'll have to deal with the surly old paradise valley women that prowl the tables and the service takes a long moment to warm up but there are n't too many dinners that offer as much for the value . great french inspired dining at a reasonable price
2 one of the positives of being <unk> at the scottsdale shea hospital for several days is that it has allowed me the chance to knock off several east scottsdale restaurants from my yelp list . the canteen was at the top of said list and a few visits gave me
3 phoenix needs mary coyle and sugar bowl because , if anything , they serve as a tasty time <unk> to another time . it also helps that mary makes the best raspberry shakes this side of bear lake , utah .
3 a tip of the hat , make that a non la , to these folks and to vietnamese food in general . the perfect place for a quick and filling lunch that 's easy on the old wallet and gentle on my diet .
3 great waffles , great chicken , great service , and great <unk> afternoon nap after lunch . seriously do n't eat lunch here if you have any important meetings within 5 hours . i am attracted and <unk> to this concept at the same time . my body has decided
2 a good above-average sandwich that i would probably enjoy more often if i had more reason to be in that part of town . the radius of their sandwiches are ideal for eating as they are n't too wide , too tall , or too sloppy . the meats are
3 <unk> your hot dog <unk> and enjoy a fresh , local take on a time honored street food . the na an bread bun is a stroke of genius and their commitment to <unk> their food locally will definitely <unk> themselves to the locals . my only complaint ? that
2 a solid throw back burger with some 21st century `` i give more of a damn about the quality of the products i eat '' adjustments . sit back and think about the origins of this great concept ... i say sit back because that is what you 'll be
3 a great french bakery without having to deal with the french pretension . the sandwiches are good but the true joy comes from biting into one of their fresh pastries . well done mr. pierre <unk> .
3 a good , consistent menu that has never <unk> to satisfy . it 's got the dark , rich steak house atmosphere without the heavy and pretentious menu . usual favorites are the ribs , thai steak salad , and the salmon . the salad in particular is worth a
3 after months of hearing about this place from friends we decided it was time to validate the claims . picture this : have you ever seen a comedy because one of your trusted friends said it was the best thing this side of monty python ? you sit down for
3 these guys are taking tortas in some bold new directions . a slight nod to these sandwiches over those by other purveyors like tortas el guero . on a personal note : tortas to me are the krispy kremes of the sandwich world . the first few bites are an
4 think of how boring phoenix would be without this landmark . the only problem is that we need a few more of these mountains . i mean , have you tried climbing this thing on a saturday morning ? it 's as bad as a black friday at macy 's
2 when the price of your burger combo exceeds $ 10 you start <unk> into vig , delux , farm house grill , indulge burger territory . and when you draw that comparison the five guys is out of its league . the burger is good but is it better then
2 good spot that gets the added nod due to its long standing reputation in the valley . the machaca is worth the trip but the rest of the menu is pretty standard traditional mexican fare . the nice granite counters and copies of the wall street <unk> <unk> its mexican
3 nice little upscale place in scottsdale . we split the mac and cheese , which was awesome , and we both had the espresso rubbed filet . the service was exceptional . i ordered a glass of <unk> that did n't agree with me . our server promptly swapped it
3 great food . i love sitting at the bar . i usually get a pizza . lots of choices and i 've never had anything bad .
4 we ask for the fried calamari done extra crispy . . the calamari comes out in a good mix of <unk> and <unk> . good crunch and always a good taste . both dipping sauces have a good tang to them .
1 moderately good food . less than i expected . cash needed
4 not a ton i can add that has n't already been covered . this place is <unk> ! when you make reservations , which you should definitely do , make sure to request the patio . it 's spacious and although i get colder faster than any phoenix native ,
4 this is my favorite place to catch a show hands down . the outdoor venue is the pinnacle of why i moved to arizona . the soft grass , great sound , and excellent bands mesh together like a mini edge fest . the only thing i could do without
3 chris r and i were two <unk> football fans <unk> the <unk> of sports bars in the phoenix area . made soft by previous seasons of <unk> with limitless 30 packs of coors light , cheap homemade food , and plenty of room to stretch out in front of multiple
4 i was very impressed and surprised by the quality of this restaurant ! this place is stylish - whether it 's the plush lounge chairs on the patio , or the old school movies being <unk> on the walls - there 's definitely an element of class that is rare
3 i got ta say , i was honestly going to rate this place at three stars until i read <unk> s 's review and was reminded that los taquitos is definitely solid . he 's dead on - although there are better tacos in phoenix -lrb- ie - the mcdowell
3 i do n't think you can really expect to find authentic vietnamese food this close to old town , but they do a fine job here . everything i 've had here is good . i did have an appetizer with shrimp and sweet potato -lrb- if i remember correctly
4 trader vic 's has a rockin happy hour . the food is great , the drinks are tasty , and <unk> large if you get that one in the barrel . our server was great , had good recommendations , and kept cracking jokes . all around a good time
2 this is a tough one ... easily 3.5 stars if there was such a rating , but the fact is that the food is really mediocre for irish -- quite comparable to the two mccaffrey pubs . that said , it 's a great place to grab a drink ,
4 this place gets an easy four stars for being a good spot to catch bands , grab some decent -lrb- but appropriately greasy -rrb- bar food , and enjoy an always decent drink selection . the extra star is for the owners , particularly ross , who have done so
0 back to my belief that service needs to weigh <unk> on expectations in the `` service industry , '' i 've got to share an experience at local breeze from a recent visit . my friend ordered a salad without the bacon , but the kitchen apparently missed this request
2 my wife loves it , whereas i think it 's perfectly fine . what i do n't get -lrb- and one of my other favorites does this too -rrb- is why i 'm waiting for the <unk> drip coffee and paying extra for it . i think this is the
2 i hesitate to give these guys three stars , but i feel that it 's four stars half the time and two stars the other half , so three it is . i went there tonight for a beer after the phoenix suns game and actually received attentive enough service
2 i wish i could give 3.5 stars , but 3 will do ... last night we tried the <unk> combo and thought the pizza -lrb- feta , spinach , and red onion -rrb- was quite good , although i 'm not a fan of the frozen spinach ; the wings

4 a hip japanese restaurant with a wide range of selections form ravioli to sushi to steak . unique <unk> of often offered selections . one of the better restaurants in the valley . bring your credit card .

3 really like the panko fish here . i 've been coming here since the 6th grade , since i went to school right around the corner . i have always loved it . they even made it through the lightrail <unk> fiasco that ate up a lot of nearby businesses

4 i do n't know if it was a slow night , but when we came here last in 2011 , you had to wait to be seated , the place would be packed . not so much anymore . i guess that 's the life of a scottsdale restaurant .
3 unfortunately , we did not eat here . it was the starting point of a bike pub ride but we did get a chance to check the place out . as the name mentions , it is a sausage fest . the beer menu looks really <unk> . i just

4 my favorite stop for a breakfast burrito and a great cup of coffee .
3 reliably good food at reasonable prices - for the scottsdale area . in other towns it would be the five-star <unk> restaurant . the food is <unk> . my salmon dinner was nicely prepared and presented ; service was excellent for a busy saturday evening .

4 so , sweet republic lived up to the hype . i mean seriously , so good . if you like ice cream , you have to try this . the shop is small , clean , and the staff is helpful . the cherry chocolate chip is full of chunks
3 i am from texas and i do love the regional food . my husband had been craving a good chicken fried steak , so we decided to try texaz grill . the parking can be a pain . if you pull into the spots right in front of the building
3 yummy ! veggie egg rolls are excellent - really interesting , complex flavor . egg flower soup is full of vegetables and is a lot heartier than i expected . lemon chicken is pretty good - not terribly exciting , but not bad by any means . the ma po
2 cute , little shop with lots of interesting and unique jewelry , clothing , gift items , etc. . it 's fun to walk around and look at the different stuff . i think the prices are too high for what you get , but it 's fun to window
3 what a great place . i stopped in with some friends for happy hour -lrb- 4:00 <unk> , i believe -rrb- . each night has different specials ; we were able to enjoy half priced house wine and well cocktails . our server was really friendly and the restaurant is
4 * update * this was originally a four star review -lrb- i deducted a star only because you have to pay an extra $ <unk> to sub <unk> milk in your latte ! -rrb- , but i had to change it . i love giant so very , very much
4 $ 5 martinis and $ 5 manicures on mondays !!! the <unk> teaches at a school , so - needless to say - the manicure was great . the drinks were good . the bartender stayed on top of us , but also out of our way . the atmosphere
4 i love me some <unk> ! it is hands down my favorite chill lounge in downtown phoenix . the crafty cocktails and small bites are perfect to help unwind after work . the music is chill and even on the weekends you can have a conversation because the music is
4 i am blessed to have a sunflower <unk> walking distance of my salon and another within bike riding distance of my house . i love this place ! i usually get my lunch from here a few times a week and it fits into my budget nicely . i usually
0 totally disappointed on so many levels with this place . i went there last night excited to finally try the place since i drive past it on my way to and from work everyday . when it is all lit up at night it just seems so inviting . i
3 i have been a patron of kyoto for 15 years , in fact went on a really bad date there when i was 21 . even though the date was painfully bad it did n't ruin my taste for kyoto . now i love sushi and have been to many
3 i love this place ! we 've never been to greece or have had `` authentic '' greek food at a fancy restuarant but i have had <unk> and gyros and new york city so i 'm basing my comparison on that and i think this place is pretty awesome
2 i would say compared to other <unk> and movie theatres , it 's about par . we 've been coming here for a few years now and like that it 's in a shopping center area . it 's easy to just get a meal and then head to the
3 my husband 's been wanting to try this place so we decided to check it out on one of our trips into phoenix . very friendly staff , simple menu , very delicious food . i ca n't really explain what the sandwiches are like . you just have to
4 love coming here . great service , neat little grocery area -lrb- more eclectic stuff than actual groceries -rrb- , and the food is awesome -lrb- simple menu but delicious -rrb- .
3 it has been a while since i 've been here . you know the place is good when you have n't gone in a couple of years and they 've expanded !! this place is just as good now as it was before . we enjoyed the shredded beef with
2 root beer is delicious . service is very good . it 's hidden <unk> in the back of a strip of stores so you wo n't see it driving by . enjoyed or meals .
3 my first experience here was an ok one . it was on a day when there was a live jazz band playing , which were phenomenal . since moving to the area carly 's bistro has become one of my local favorites . i find myself coming back time and
4 sit ... stay and you wo n't be disappointed . short leash takes a great american pass time food , the hot dog , and turns it into a dining experience to not miss out on . their gourmet style hot dogs will thrill your taste buds in the moment
3 this little gem in downtown phoenix is easy to overlook . located in what appears to be another house in a residential area but is actually a quiet italian restaurant . the place is nestled behind a row of trees that afford some privacy for the patio diners . the
3 this outdoor mall located in tempe is amazing ! pros : almost every store you could wish for , great variety from food to clothes to coffee and tea . or if you prefer catch an afternoon matinee . con : parking lot is confusing and during christmas season stay
2 i know everybody loves this place and it does have a nice charm . i really appreciated that in december they were not playing christmas music during my meal ! i have eaten here a few times and while i enjoy my meal for me it 's nothing spectacular .
4 no country for old buffet . the banter over tapas will never end just as my love for sens with their `` infusion '' of different asian styles and ingredients . the tofu , the cold duck , sweet & sour soup and fried quail were amazing . add to
4 i also tried the beef tacos and chilaquiles and they were fantastic . the chilaquiles can be made to order with your choice of meat and sauce . since this place opened , i think i 've been to la tolteca or chico 's grill only once .
3 a movie theatre with a lounge in downtown phoenix ? i think scottsdale -lrb- i mean hell -rrb- just <unk> over . this is great venue for watching an independent flick while enjoying your favorite brew and japanese snack . i ca n't wait to visit again because i 've
2 i do n't know what the hype is all about . i was n't impressed . a. the location is awkward . walk inside this weird building and then walk through a second set of doors to get to actual restaurant . it 's slightly off the beaten path so
3 i like this place . the boyfriend does n't . he 's partial to harkins . but i prefer this theater because it 's typically pretty empty and we do n't have to listen to bratty kids talking through the whole movie . we 've been here a couple times
4 by far one of the best mexican places downtown . their menu is not just burritos with american cheese like the other typical so called `` mexican '' places around the corner . their chef has great traditional plates that you will find within the colonial belt in central mexico
3 great food here , i am having a guilt trip not giving them a full 5 stars . stop by and have breakfast , lunch or dinner , they do n't disappoint . i love their bloody mary 's ! i love scotch too .
3 great little place that reminds me of one of my favorite places in downtown los angeles -lrb- see review for <unk> -rrb- . this place is not your typical sushi place it definitely is small and seating is tight , no teppan tables . remember to byob and even though
0 the service here is not the problem , nor is the the <unk> of tv 's -lrb- quite impressed with the fireplace screen -rrb- it 's the bad food . how can you mess up nachos and pretzels ? they serve these appetizers with a bland cheese and the salsa
3 i am always up to try new chinese places but most of times i have been disappointed . my friend invited me to lunch and said this place was one of the best and despite the <unk> degree weather outside , this place was great . we ordered fried wontons
1 another review started the beginning of december ... i 'm seriously falling behind ! server was great ... crab cakes were ice cold inside ... gm chris was awesome . tried his best to make it right but i have a strict ` do n't eat sent back food '
4 fantastic
2 second time for dinner ... if you 're in the area , give it a try but not worth driving for . the food was good but not great ... food came out fast but drink service was extremely slow and this was on a thursday night with only 3-4
2 pretty typical mongolian grill joint where they cook the food in front of you . large variety of tofu , meats , and vegetables to pile into your bowl . many different choices of sauces to pour over your items . if you go for dinner , you will get
2 my family loves getting pizza from here . very nice new york style pizza . they have pretty good wings and garlic knots also .
2 very good burgers , fries , and shakes . other people have said they have good steak and cheese sandwiches . parking situation is not very good .
1 the food here was n't horrible but the service sucked and was very slow . it took over an hour to get our food once seated . stay away from the pizzas ... they are like dense cardboard . the burger was pretty good but overpriced for what it was
0 not good . waited 15 minutes to order and 25 minutes for food . brisket was like chewing leather and was almost cold . mac and cheese were nothing special . cornbread was more like ice cold yellow cake . i do n't know what kind of low grade bbq
3 the food and service here are good . try the pizzas . my favorite is the pork pibil . i would probably give them 5 stars but they got rid of my old favorite item from the menu -lrb- carne adovada -rrb- . they brew some good beer too .
4 wow . . a waiting line on a friday afternoon means somethings good here . . i was not disappointed . love it all . . the <unk> plate is amazing , service it top notch i will be back . . chips and salsa alone are like crack .
4 love love love the food ! service no so much . . i went with a small group of lady friends during lunch hour , food was great menu was stellar with lots of options that were unique twists on old time classics . . however the services was lacking
3 this spot used to be a <unk> , <unk> sushi bar . i 'm happy to see that someone recognized and <unk> the potential of this location and its layout -- so happy that i 'm sad to be <unk> tempe . anywho , the decor is <unk> . of
3 wonderful family-owned restaurant . good food , good service , relaxing atmosphere . mondays were a little slower than other nights so this became my dinner , class prep , read , grade papers spot . i loved the turkish coffee and chatting with the fam . they 're also
3 how many times have you been seated at a table in an interesting , well reviewed or recommended restaurant , been handed a menu and went about selecting your meal ? have you ever wondered what goes on behind the scenes ? wanted to know what goes into getting food
2 saint francis of <unk> may be the patron saint of animals and the environment but after a recent visit , i wonder if st francis neighborhood restaurant in central phoenix can live up to it 's namesake . i 'd heard several things about this little restaurant near camelback road
3 i have a healthy , nearly full term food baby that chef becky <unk> & the herb box restaurant are responsible for ! this quaint little <unk> ' located on market street in scottsdale 's uber chic dc ranch area , is a gift to the culinary world . having
4 essence bakery has a cozy atmosphere , friendly and attentive staff , and some of the best macaroons you will ever taste . their award winning chef never disappoints . my favorite meal is the open faced steak sandwich with blue cheese . it 's so tasty ! while the
4 postino 's is a great date restaurant . especially on mondays and tuesdays when they have their $ 20 bruschetta and bottle of wine special . you can choose any bottle of wine off of their fairly long list of wines and get a delicious board of bruschetta for only
4 this place is awesome for a healthy and delicious lunch ! prices are reasonable for how good and fresh the food is , and i find the portions to be spot on . the danish salad is out of this world yummy ! i do n't really like the dressing
3 i came in here for lunch during the work week and found it to be a nice place to get away from work for a little while ... open patio , big floor to ceiling glass windows , nice lighting . service was pretty good , not the fastest to
2 thirsty lion is an upscale pub with a good food menu but the beer is just too expensive . i came here on a wednesday night for trivia and the place was packed . it took about 30 minutes to get a table for 4 , so i 'd recommend
3 my boyfriend & i went to lon 's for a romantic date night at sunset . he picked lon 's because there are many sources saying it 's a great place to watch an arizona sunset which we found out is simply not true but the food was delicious &
3 finally - a bbq place that is good for the meat eater and a vegetarian ! plus nice indoor and outdoor seating and cute decor . bryan 's has multiple vegetarian options , which is pretty amazing . things i 've had : - fried artichoke po ` boy :
3 the mission is a great place to come for a fancier mexican meal . the atmosphere is trendy and fun , there are a ton of drink options , and the food is quite good . i had : - tableside guacamole : rather overpriced at $ 12 for 1
4 <unk> mexican grocery store ever ! this place is huge , clean , well kept , stocked with all sorts of awesome products , super low prices , and the friendliest people . i hate getting in the car for anything , and phoenix ranch market is worth the 30
3 i am in a <unk> coma while writing this review ... heading back to work from an ajs salad bar lunch run , i mention to my 2 colleagues , `` wan na get a free sprinkles cupcake ? '' they both say sure as we pass through the light
3 this place is my go-to for meat i 'm throwing in a <unk> -lrb- usually pork <unk> -rrb- ! $ <unk> -lrb- approx -rrb- per lb for boneless pork shoulder . yes , please ! closer than driving to phoenix ranch off 16th and a lot quicker to get in
3 now i 've only gone to <unk> for breakfast prior to this past saturday . i try to stay as far away from the area i work on the weekends . lol with gelato calling my name , us still needing dinner , and wanting a burger than thai food
2 we 've gone to salt river fields now twice . first time was for the an event about 2 years ago . parking was a <unk> and you had to pay $ 5 to park on a dirt lot . the second time was just this saturday for the balloon
4 j and i went here for a quick breakfast the day after christmas . we had baby c in tow with us . can i just say that our waitress was awesome !!! i was changing baby c 's diaper in the bathroom and well , let 's just say
4 back again we go -lrb- okay , so this was n't the <unk> 's first time back ... ive stopped counting how many times we 've had sld . . lol -rrb- for some tasty dogs on wednesday night at the <unk> ! i mention that i wanted to try
3 i <unk> down to <unk> to grab lunch from the food trucks today during my break . now , j is n't a fan of filipino food . and i never had an urge to try it . but . . when i saw that my only food truck option
3 there was no doubt where i was going to take j for his father 's day <unk> . fogo it was going to be ! i did however have a little hesitation on taking baby c along with us . would they have high chairs ? never saw any <unk>
4 after getting into an <unk> at another az casino with a fellow bj player , i 've decided that table poker is the game for me . 3 card poker specifically !!! love going to the wild horse pass casino . all the table dealers i 've dealt with there
2 flew in and out of there recently on allegiant air . they offered a nonstop to <unk> mo , and i was going to <unk> for a week , -lrb- yes , i am a hick -rrb- . i used to work out in this area , so i know
1 went there last night and got the baked chipotle <unk> and the two tickets to paradise shrimp sandwich . this is the second time i have been there , and the second time it was just ok . we went because we had a groupon . if you do n't
3 i went to tc eggington 's today , and had the phoenician chicken feta grille , but had it on an onion bun instead of a pita ... and omg is was so good . the chicken was moist and flavorful , lots of gooey melted cheese , the dipping
3 my wife , son and i always enjoy this location .
2 they have a good happy hour on sundays . sushi is pretty good but i did n't like the nachos .
4 their food is authentico italiano . i loved the arancini to start and my tortellini was homemade and unbelievably excellent . i will come back during happy hour for their deal that includes a bottle of wine . fox restaurants are always a high standard .
4 now also my favorite burger when i want one that tastes like homemade that is packed with that grilled flavor and fresh ingredients , especially the thick and crunchy pickles . i was given a taste of the salted dulce de leche shake and it was fantastic !
2 good , decent burger but wanted medium rare and got medium instead . the server tried to confirm my request for medium rare when ordering as if i do n't know what it means , but it came out over anyway . onions were pretty good : nice and crispy
2 daphne 's is a total <unk> staple . i go there regularly and it 's so `` eh , pretty good '' that i have never thought to review it . my standby is the combo chicken , which comes with a <unk> kabob skewer , gyro meat , a
3 yay !!!!!!!!!!! after months of anticipation , the new vig location -lrb- closer to me vs. what is now affectionately referred to as `` the vintage vig '' -rrb- is open and did not disappoint ! whew ! the parking seems to still have some kinks to work out ,
4 i love az88 there , i said it . while i will admit that i was first introduced to az88 by my `` will , '' it is a very mixed crowd and depending on when you go , is certainly no more of a scene than anywhere else in
3 if you want a thick greasy delicious burger that will <unk> your remaining arteries and wreck your <unk> <unk> , come to smash burger ; -rrb- .
4 this was the spot that me and my <unk> buddies would go to for our monthly <unk> meal . we would come , sit down and devour all that is needed to drown the pain , the pain of <unk> . food = spectacular , everything is really good ,
2 i was very surprised when i realized the location of the restaurant and that i had not happened upon it before this is definitely a ` no-frills '' type of place so it lacked much on decor . on the saturday afternoon that i went , i ordered the ``
3 i love this place ! finally had a chance to revisit after a long , <unk> absence . apparently , they are in the process of changing their name to `` caribbean spice '' . in addition to the name change , they have appeared to have <unk> down the
3 i ca n't believe people are comparing jersey mike 's to subway !!!!!! no way ... they slice the meat and cheese right in front of you ... it is not <unk> and been sitting in a tub all day like the competitor 's . the produce is always so
3 been here twice ... and both times were worth the wait . it is a tiny little place with nice , genuine staffers . both times i ordered their specials of the day ... and both times ... yum !! one was a scramble with anaheim chilies in it ...
1 this particular monday i was in the mood for something healthy and affordable and with it 's overwhelming positive reviews i figured it would be a place to check out . after waiting in line in the drive through for what seemed like forever , i finally <unk> through the
4 i agree with the previous posts . i was looking for a reasonably priced , but delicious lunch and found this place on yelp . they were celebrating their 35th year anniversary and were thrilled to find out i was visiting for the first time . i met the owner
4 you ca n't go wrong with houston 's ! i 've been to the one in miami , atlanta , phoenix , scottsdale and chicago -lrb- the chicago one closed -rrb- and they are all fabulous ! the service is outstanding and the spinach dip is awesome ! actually ,
3 this is a pretty cool place , especially if you love frank sinatra ! his music is often playing overhead and i love it ! the sauce they make has a bit of a sweet flavor to it , but it works ! they also make their own italian sausage
3 i wanted to give this place 5 stars because it is truly a wonderful <unk> bar . however , i really hate that they do n't have their <unk> <unk> <unk> on friday and saturday nights ! dennis <unk> is there on thursday nights and ms reed is there on
4 i 've been going to this place for several years now and i have yet to be disappointed !! their apple crepes will make you wan na slap yo ' mama !! i just love this place !!
4 if you are looking for some good gumbo and great conversion , then this is the place for you ! the gumbo is fabulous and they make it right on front of you !! the service can be s bit slow , but it 's worth the wait !!
0 this is the worst place when it comes customer service ! we called and made reservations a week ago and they said the could accommodate 20 people without any problem ! we then called the morning of and told them we were on our way . we got there at
2 nice to have downtown but hit and miss , inconsistent quality . dishes are mostly too sweet . more savory options would make this place more appealing . either quality at this location is slipping or i have gotten bored with average <unk> asian dishes .
4 please come to downtown phoenix !!!! this place is consistently fantastic .
1 expensive . the deli needs a lot of work . their pastas and deserts are way too overpriced for the quality . chocolate mousse tasted like whipped cream with <unk> 's syrup blended in . overcooked cold large prawns were so bad i had to return the item .
4 100 % predictably good food that is bad for you ; the taste is worth the splurge of calories and fat . delicious consistently .
4 great addition to downtown .
3 good food good time
4 consistently a perfect carwash . but their complete detail ? best in phoenix hands down . you will not recognize your car when you get it back . it is like having the same car the day you picked it up from the showroom . fantastic staff and business !
3 thanks to my friend erin for showing me this place . tucked away in an industrial park , i was finally impressed with a bbq place in az . . the place fills up quickly , so she recommended we get there around 11 or after 12:30 . on the

3 my first experience with casey moore 's was a team lunch this afternoon - a team of about 20 people . the restaurant was large enough to accomodate everyone and the staff was very helpful in <unk> tables and chairs . <unk> service was prompt and the food surprisingly quick
1 i visited rei on my lunch hour to pick up a couple of outdoor flash lights . the store has a nice selection of about anything outdoorsy and from previous conversations with their store clerks , the employees are very <unk> . they offer <unk> that some of my friends
2 <unk> provides a good sized dining area with many choices of yogurt and toppings . i did find it a little difficult to locate when i attempted to find the building - it is tucked away in the back corner of a strip mall parking lot . it was dark
2 my review of my big fat greek restaurant may be somewhat skewed because i did n't order the greek items on the menu that others have reviewed . i went with a friend from work and we each ordered a calzone . really it is n't that difficult to make
3 this bar really has two distinct personalities . there is the original bar which has a few taps , but mostly bottles & cans . it is more of a traditional dive bar and has the major label beers -lrb- plus some of the forgotten brews that are more nostalgic
3 i am still a sushi novice and remain in the calm waters of the california roll and salmon rolls - occasionally philadelphia and las vegas ... meeting up with ebony k. she attempted to move me a little more off the wall . i went as far as the rainbow
2 me and a few teammates came for a team lunch today . the service was very good the waitress kept the drinks full , which is very important . most of us ordered from the `` perfect pairings '' menu , which brings two items for $ 8.95 . i

3 just a little update . my husband and i ate breakfast here the other day . the line to order was n't too long , but i have heard it can be out the door some mornings . i ordered the smoked salmon <unk> with a side of fruit .
2 this place has been here for years and though i 've lived in phoenix all of my life i just started eating here about a year ago . i was kind of leery about trying it out . it 's not in the best neighborhood and i figured the seafood
1 a lot of bands i listen to end up playing the marquee . it 's not a horrible venue , but yeah , the parking sucks and so do the security . as if i did n't pay enough for the tickets , now i have to pay $ 5
1 smeeks should really advertise itself as a novelty shop , not a candy shop . there is barely any candy in the place . this place is hella expensive . i saw so many cute and kooky things , but with what they charge i would n't buy anything .
0 after seeing a recent review about this safeway it reminded me of the last time i shopped there and it made me never want to go back . as i reached the check out line i hear the cashier say out loud `` oh not another customer . c'mon there
4 the blue fin is a great little place and it truly needs our love . due to the light rail biz for them has dropped a bit . i 've never been disappointed with anything i have ordered . the gyoza is great , the beef curry and chicken curry
3 it was good ...
4 loved the food . the freshness of it . great ambiance . clean . simplistic elegance ...
4 best pizza in the valley . we go back again and again ...
4 this was going to be the absolute last time we bought `` groupon . '' had a bad experience with the last groupon restaurant . we just decided only <unk> restaurants go with the groupon thing . changed our mind today . some groupons are hidden gems like this one
2 you get a delicious chocolate chip cookie with your meal . other than that , nothing stood out outstandingly . sandwiches are good . salads are decent . soups are tasty -lrb- when they are n't sold out of the one you want -rrb- . and once , i wanted
4 even though i do n't dine here nearly as often as my taste buds would like , i love sauce ! the handful of times i 've been here , i 've never had anything to complain about . i 've had a few different menu items , namely ,
2 corleone 's is good . my favorite is the chicken italiano , but sometimes the chicken is too dry . the original is great too . i like mine with provolone instead of whiz . both the steak and chicken are lean and sliced thin . the staff is nice
2 i , as most other red <unk> females in town , have been awaiting the arrival of h & m in scottsdale for a long time . i first found this gem in chicago , loved it ! such cute clothes and inexpensive . come to find out you can
3 from the start i had a bit of a chip on my shoulder from the reservation making process . monday morning i find out that i need to make a reservation for 8 people for dinner that night , at 5:30 or 6 p.m. . so i quickly get on
1 i am torn between a 2 and 3 star review , but i think the 2 will out weigh the 3 this time . the over all experience was nice and fun , however there were some very distracting elements that took away from the charm and experience . first
2 with a name like mastro 's in the name you can be assured that you will be satisfied . and satisfied we were on our annual outing with the <unk> family . great food , good people and an all around great time . the staff was very quick to
2 i know that this place is a phoenix staple , but just because something is really old does n't mean its always good . texaz grill is very mediocre . the building is cool , lots of old stuff all over , almost feels a little cramped , but for
3 i <unk> ' t been into radio milano quite as many times as i have been into postino , but i have to say of those times i have , i was impressed . they have complimentary valet parking which in this neighborhood is a huge plus ! their menu

4 literally as good as it gets when i s comes to <unk> . they are so fun ! they have everything from buffalo , ostrich , lamb , kobe beef , turkey , veggie , and a few other . they have several of their favorites put together , such
2 why 3 stars ... lem me explain . first off , it did n't live up to the hype my friends all raved about . maybe it was a bad day , but i only have what they gave me to go on . the waitress was nice as can
3 probably the best half moon location in town ! everyone 's got ta love a good sports bar . this one is centrally located , close to my gym and set up nicely . they recently , well within the last year , renovated their patio , it needed it
2 i am conflicted between two and four stars , so <unk> i went with three . i do love me some pei wei , for several reasons . they are usually very conveniently located , you can order online , everything is yummy , they are very consistent -lrb- what
2 i really hate writing follow up reviews that are n't as stellar as the first , however , in this case i have no choice . i took the parents here for a sunday lunch this past weekend , and had a very underwhelming experience , service side only .
2 okay , the first thing i will say ... do not go inside the snack bar . bring your own food and drink . it 's a little scary . if you do n't know what i mean then by all means check it out for yourself but do n't
3 i had no idea they were open for lunch ! perfect since the boy and i were down town during lunch the other day . we stopped in around 2:30 <unk> afternoon . no wait ! i could n't even believe it . i had n't eaten there since i
3 great for togo ! we ordered from here for our office meeting yesterday . they were very helpful over the phone . plus they were the first place that when i call them before they open they do n't give me attitude about ordering early . `` yes i understand

3 i could n't decide between a 3 star or 4 ... i error on the side of the establishment , and my possible bad mood and gave it 4 . i can not stand a mandatory 15 minute speech by the server or host about how awesome the place is
3 great atmosphere ! this time of year is the best for outdoor eating . the staff is friendly , and the food is great . try the gringo burro , it is manly and tasty . wash it down with a house margarita , and you are set . house
4 wonderful food , nice atmosphere , friendly waitstaff . lots of chicken & veggie dishes if you 're watching your carbs , and lots of injera if you are n't . portions appear small but we were quite stuffed by meal 's end . i will definitely go back ,
4 i walked in there all <unk> and innocent and said , `` i wan na buy a plant . '' now , most customer service agents would likely <unk> a newbie and say , `` <unk> ... what <unk> ? '' and i would be like , um , ``

3 well , despite having -lrb- ugh -rrb- tapioca -lrb- ugh -rrb- that they stick in tea , the republic is a pretty awesome place . now my wife tells me that this is different than pho but i do n't really see how . it 's a bowl of <unk>
4 love love love this place ! scottsdale places are pretty hit or miss , in my opinion , but most of the things that come out of frc is excellent . this one is no exception . besides the $ 3.75 blueberry beer -lrb- which is cheaper than it is
3 what an awesome place . i am sorry that it took me so long to get here . it is totally a 5-star place in a 2-star location . if i could pick up the whole building and move it to that triangle lot on central & camelback , i

1 yes , i 'm spoiled . i grew up in denver and enjoyed dia -- the most pristine airport you will ever visit -- for the majority of my life . in comparison , sky harbor is just another run-of-the-mill airport . the food sucks . one time before a

3 great little <unk> on a paved road to the radio towers . steep enough to be a solid workout , if a little on the short side . not usually too crowded . i dislike the descent because of the <unk> , but the convenience of the hike -lrb- no
1 great service and nice ambiance , but the food does n't hold up . i started with the spinach , apple and gorgonzola salad , which comes with chicken , and none of the flavors worked right . the nicest thing i could say about the salad was that the

3 great food , good service , low prices ... this place is a win as far as i 'm concerned . i need to keep working on the pizza to find a favorite , but in the meantime i 'll keep coming back for that italian hoagie on wheat ...
4 best burgers in town .
4 great food and an amazingly friendly staff . the burgers are massive .
0 not what i expected at all . all the reviews say it 's amazing , better than bianco 's , blah blah . not really that good . i mean it was barely edible . i had the marg . pizza . nope sorry ! it was just a cheese
3 great fusion food . i love the funky pizza 's and the pastas are fantastic . i know the portion sizes are <unk> , but thats the fun of this place . good consistent food . always a joy to go eat at . nice to support local too .
1 not super impressed by this place . i ordered something simple . a cheese omelet , it was ok at best . potatoes greasy ! this place gets good reviews and maybe i should have ordered one of the bene 's to get a better taste for the place but
0 really ? i have been here twice and my main meals were terrible . dry and flavorless , blah . i emailed tthe owners a long detailed experience at their establishment . they thought i was a critic for a magazine . i said nope just a foodie who experienced
1 this place is all hype . i have eaten here a few times . the lines are long and the crowd totally pretentious and obnoxious !! most come in in there workout gear and have not <unk> broke a sweat . the rest are a bunch of snotty tool bags
2 good and consistent for a chain . never can go wrong with the food .
4 this is what local arizona stores are all about . this place is one of my favorite finds . i love the selection of cards , books , and knick knacks they have in the store . enough to keep me occupied for hours ! it 's your neighborhood <unk>
2 i think this place is a tad over-rated . the food is good but because they are always so over crowded and busy , their service is extremely slow . the wait is rarely less than 15 minutes . my husband loves their selection of beers , but if i
4 big fan of fry bread house . i love the hominy beef stew with the fry bread . the fry bread is just flat out amazing . that stew is so good i usually burn my tongue with inadequate waiting . i 've had the tacos & they 're good
4 hit up modern burger with jason w. and deb s. yesterday . i totally think this needs a separate <unk> from modern steak as it 's quite different and for what it is , it 's good ... it 's basically a window in the side of sam fox 's
4 ok , i give up . i had a previous review of andreoli that i gave 3 stars . they probably did n't care anyway . i gave it a lower rating because of the lack of service . at this point , i just do n't care . i

3 stopped back into my mother 's today for a second visit . last time , i noticed that a lot of the other customers were eating spaghetti , so i wanted to give that a try this time & compare it to old spaghetti factory . this was a tuesday
3 got together with arlin b. for a first visit to this chompie 's today & went with their `` soup ! sandwich ! & slaw '' special that included kreplach soup , a big half pastrami on rye and a cup of cole slaw . this big place was comfortable
4 i 've been eating here from time to time , but wow , it 's been 20 months since my review . better give them an update ! i 'm happy to report that hong kong here has been consistently good all this time , & they have n't increased
4 i do n't really do the whole `` hang out at a coffeebar '' type thing , so my review is based only on the drink itself , which has been awesome every time i 've been there . best in the valley . it 's a shame central is
4 i love bevmo . huge selection of wines . huge selection of beers . huge selection of liquors & spirits . pretty much anything kind of accessory you could want for a <unk> party . reminds me a lot of <unk> 's back in chicago .
3 a dude playing irish music on a <unk> in a bar in north phoenix ? count me in . this is a pretty good <unk> place with your traditional attempt at <unk> -lrb- stew , shepherd 's pie , bangers & mash -rrb- with a few irish beers -lrb- guinness
3 oh man , if you do n't especially like your heart -lrb- or at least can justify it by working out after -rrb- , this is an awesome place . i 've been extremely skeptical of `` chicago '' places here in the valley , because most are bad impressions
4 in a word : superior . long live los compadres !
4 the vegan gods have spoken and have <unk> : `` let there be green '' . far and away the best vegan place between los angeles and east st. louis , green is beyond awesome . the buffalo chicken wing & samosa appetizers <unk> original po ' boy sandwich ?
0 i ca n't eat here anymore . the food is fine and the bagels are the best in town . the shit attitudes and poor service kill it . fuck chompie 's !
3 i love the salsa ; plenty of garlic and no green chilies . i pick up to-go containers all the time , and it gets hotter and tastier the longer is sits in the fridge . this is the kind of mexican place where everything is fried . there 's
3 this place is pretty tasty and has great happy hour specials ! the 2 high lights of my visit , imo , were the awesome chorizo mac 'n' cheese and sitting on the small but nice patio . my chicken nachos were good too but i just kept stealing my
3 got back from the state fair earlier tonight . ugh , food coma . i had deep-fried everything : oreo 's , cheese curds , funnel cakes , corn dogs ... and a grilled corn that was drenched in butter . it was all delicious and since i split everything
2 ok so ... this place is cool . i love the idea of it but , might want to try it again because when boba tea i ordered was ... interesting . not something i 'd <unk> actually . my friend liked his tea a lot though ! there are
3 tasty fro-yo and super fresh toppings ! wish i 'd have logged into yelp to see their special offer ... oh well . $ <unk> an ounce here ... bit more than other places but i 'm sure it 's because of the location . see ya there !
3 got beer ? no ? need specialty beer ? this bevmo might be your spot . there have been more than a couple of times when a seasonal specialty was at the end of it 's run and my roommate can only find it at this location . of course
4 delicious ! joe 's is the best bbq that i tried in az . . i loved all their selections because they have something for everyone , from ribs to giant baked potatoes . there is really not much i can say that the other reviewers have ' t said
3 a friend took me here for an early dinner a couple of months back , just to show me the place . it has a super cool atmosphere that he thought i 'd like ... and a cheese and pretzel fondue appetizer . well , it was pretty freaking fun
3 if i did loved this place ... so easy going , different for everything i had have ... a must go in san diego ... so good
0 the gym area is big , but has a really limited amount of machines and free weights , you get bored very soon <unk> same things . is always clean , that 's the good thing , but their costumer services is one of the worst , they also over
3 modern and clean facilities and generally decent customer service . in my many times through here , it has always been very easy to get from point a to point b.
4 excellent food , reasonable prices , and solid service . the cost of the buffet / unlimited around is $ 12.50 and includes drinks . the food was all pretty fresh and the wait was minimal . i will definitely return for some more mongolian bbq !
3 great mall with plenty of stores and a decent food court .
2 when trying to decide where to meet some friends for dinner , cornish pasty was suggested and i <unk> agreed . i had read great reviews , so was happy to finally visit for myself . the food was great - worth a four or even a five star review
3 after having been in a few times for nothing more than beers and hummus , i finally had dinner here and it was great ! the vegetarian <unk> was to die for - extremely flavorful and well put together . i 'm not really adding anything new by raving about
1 the company my wife works at had a christmas party at casa <unk> @ el chorro . neither my wife , nor i , were impressed . the food is perhaps not what we like . food was a little too plain , and little too run of the mill
2 have gone to lalibela a few times 1 -rrb- 1st time with my mother and wife . the food was good . we are all familiar with ethiopian food . maybe the food was a bit americanized , as we have eaten ethiopian food elsewhere in the usa . we
4 went to house of tricks to celebrate the following , as the following occur on weekdays for us in 2012 , and the weekend is the best time for us : my birthday on 9 april our marriage day on 12 april my wife and i celebrated both , and
4 the neighborhood may be rough , but the market is really a hidden gem . this is the middle eastern market you need to go to in phoenix . they actually have injera on sale regularly !!! the shish <unk> was wonderful . my wife and i enjoyed the sandwiches
3 i order takeout from here all the time , love the place . is it like flying to hawaii and popping into your favorite grind house ? nope . is the food delicious and satisfies your cravings for hawaiian bbq ? heck yes , honestly you can not go wrong
4 never disappoints . . today i had a work lunch and ordered the appetizer # 2 <unk> cuon . . -lrb- grilled pork , shrimp , and vegetable spring rolls -rrb- a vietnamese iced coffee , and for my entree i can <unk> # 39 com dac biet so 2
2 new location ! so i ordered the soup and salad as always , asked for the fresh ground pepper . . hold on . . ok yeah still waiting . asked the nearest staff member for it again . . waiting . . manager comes back and said they were
3 i was in the area and asked a friend if they had good soup , and he replied . . `` the <unk> '' is good . i did n't know what a <unk> was , but i decided to go anyways . . while i looked over the menu
3 it may be busy , it may take a little time getting your food , but if you have a full hour for lunch or in the mood for dinner , it 's never a bad choice . they have everything from vietnamese sandwiches and soups to delicious smoothies and
3 tried the carne asada torta , it was excellent ! taco 's were great and although i cant remember what the kids had , i know they enjoyed it . the family has been back a few times without me since our first visit . looks like it 's going
3 went this afternoon with about 15 of my co workers . lots of great food and drinks to go around . i had a chicken salad that was great ! and the assorted dishes around the table all looked fantastic . the service was excellent as was the atmosphere .
3 let me just say that the hungry monk has everything you need for a good happy hour . tvs surround the bar area , plenty of spacious seating and a friendly staff await your arrival . definitely a family friendly place as well ... if you get a chance try
3 okay , i just came back from cork and found it to be alright . i loved the great drink specials they have during their happy <unk> had two of their champagne cocktails for 3 bucks each -lrb- the modern classic was awesome -rrb- and my fiance tried the red
3 this is the place to go to watch <unk> new `` about to make it big '' movies ! i 've seen so many brilliant movies here , particularly <unk> millionaire and black <unk> before they were released nationwide . since this scottsdale theater is owned by harkins it 's
2 my job chose firehouse subs to cater our last meeting . everyone gave rave reviews about the tasty subs . : -rrb- a few weeks later , my hubby and i stopped by here for dinner when we were feeling too lazy to cook . although our subs were awesome
4 bj 's is a great place for hanging out . the first thing i noticed about the restaurant is that it 's really spacious and has a brewery ready for viewing . customer service is friendly and attentive . i enjoyed my beers with the family and overall there was
4 always as a fan of any costco location . my most recent costco discovery is that you can order photos online for <unk> pickup at 13 cents each . since costco beats the nearby target in customer service i will be picking up my photos from here from now on
3 great addition to the area ! north scottsdale needs more quick and easy lunch places like which wich . we had lunch there a few days after it opened . the place was packed , but the manager helped move the line along by explaining how the ordering system worked
3 more bells and <unk> than five guys , better meat than in n out , and more options than the habit = i 'm loving smashburger ! tried it for the first time when i was killing time in the tempe marketplace before a flight . i was craving sweet
4 i prefer going to this location of macayo 's over the others because of the ambience . it 's way different than the others and it does n't `` feel '' like the other macayo 's . this one is much more festive . it has a ton of patio
1 always heard the advertisements for this place on the radio . was given the impression it was a real hip place to go . well , when you see the outside , the big cadillac and the entrance with all the license plates , you think you 're in for
2 great place to meet up with friends and have a bite or drink . it 's your typical sports bar food . we have n't tried their specials yet , so will post again after that experience .
0 just is n't very good . i do n't understand why people give this place even three stars . it 's rare for me to give a place a low rating , but , my big fat greek restaurant is nothing but gimmick anymore and has gone from bad to
3 sixth `` meeting '' for the breakfast club uye , and my second time attending . oh come on ... meeting ?! `` our meeting is eating ! '' stick it on a shirt already . also my first time at matt 's . we had to wait for our
2 * i 'm torn between 3 and 4 stars , <unk> ! so let 's just say , 3.5 . * met monica o. and <unk> s. here for lunch a couple of months back . kind of cramped atmosphere , and the dcor is interesting to say the least
1 ok , i really wanted to give this place 4 or 5 stars . been coming here for years . affordable and delicious ! especially love the spicy hunan sauce . always have had a great experience . today , i went to this location with two of my coworkers
2 first , let me say that i absolutely love chompies . i work in chandler , so they 're a standby for our meetings and any <unk> my company hosts . today was my first time actually going to this location with my friend . we were seated promptly ,
2 i came here for the fifth meet up for the breakfast club uye ... and also finally lost my uye `` <unk> '' ; haha ! it was nice to finally meet others in the yelp community . this was my first time visiting the location and trying their breakfast
3 i had a really really great time here . we were seeing a show a couple stores down at <unk> arts . all of us went in there and got beer and snacks . the sweet potato fries were excellent . i had them mix bbq sauce and ranch together
4 holy crap ! their chopped salad is to die for . order it ! also their fried bologna sandwich is divine and has so many great textures and flavors that blend perfectly together . i keep craving that rum punch cocktail and they definitely make an honest drink ... which
3 i love lgo . the french pancakes are my favorite thing to get here . i have two complaints . 1 ... parking . 2 ... the whole `` we dont have a pa so everyone crowds around to get their order '' system . it seems this place is
2 having <unk> through yogurtland , yogurtini , and red mango in the past month i 'm on a yogurt killing spree ... ... i ca n't get enough comparable to my fav yogurtland though mojo is a bit more <unk> with less variety off to yogurtland
4 this place has been my mainstay while going to asu for 3 years and i guess i 've forgotten to review them for awhile ~ their selection of korean food is much better then lee lees or mekong and since they feed from the asiana chain in california they seem
3 man happy birthday to me i came for the $ 10 off birthday deal that joe 's offers and came away with much more first of the location is around some <unk> and something you do n't see too often in arizona . ordering was quick and they have electronic
3 great venue never felt crammed in the building and the area in the arena and around it is great like others have said though ... located in the middle of nowhere and the concessions did n't seem that good oh well i got my wish to see the coyotes <unk>
1 i really wanted to like this place more . chicken fingers were excellent . the problem lies in everything else . there are only four choices on the menu and all are just variations of the same thing . no salads and only one sandwich . the french fries are
4 my wife 's work had their christmas party here last night . although the customer service was slow and average at best , the food was outstanding . i had a burger and my wife the steak salad . i was the dd , but my wife said the margaritas
4 beautiful outdoor shopping experience !
4 beautiful location ! this fry 's has everything , food , pharmacy , books , electronics a fred <unk> jewelry store , starbucks and us bank . even covered parking !
4 our go to pizza place ! do n't see how they could improve in any area . customer service is excellent , <unk> clean and the food is perfection !
3 first experience with <unk> . parking is super close to the terminal , security was fast and efficient . overall a great experience for such a small -lrb- but growing -rrb- facility .
4 why did it take me so long to try this place ?! well , it 's because there is almost always a line out the door . but now i understand why . the restaurant is tiny , but they can turn tables relatively quickly , and the food is
3 this place is supposed to be all about the tacos and between the meat choices and tortilla choices i think you could have around 10 different tacos , but they are traditional tacos with just meat , onions , and cilantro inside of 2 small tortillas -lrb- corn or flour
3 i got a taste of the braised beef sandwich at yelp in bloom and today was my first chance to try it in its full glory . there was no way i should 've finished the whole thing . but i did , and true to the sample from yelp
3 being from california , i was hesitant to try sushi in arizona . i mean , how fresh could it be ? well , i 'm glad i did because it was really fresh and really delicious here . the variety of food that you can order here is so
2 it 's a chain restaurant with a salad bar . the salad bar happens to be my favorite thing about this place and in my mind , it 's only redeeming quality . their burgers and <unk> items are just ok . i 'm still upset that they no longer
3 i keep going here . i do n't really know why . i think maybe they 're using an addictive chemical that makes me crave it <unk> ! better than the one on university . delicious salty chips and 2 different salsas . <unk> sodas . average tacos -lrb- the
4 if you walk out of this place and you are not happy you need to see a <unk> . probably best people in town -lrb- i know people love to debate that -rrb- . but if you love bj 's pizza newport beach , this is the place to go
3 very good place . nice romantic ambience . great wines , and good food . small parking area , but okay . good place to meet with your business clients .
1 i remember when i used to sit with proprietor david l. at biltmore <unk> -lrb- not cpk , you freak -rrb- and listen to him get passionate about this <unk> bakery concept thing where he could use the best ingredients and still make it inexpensively . willo bread was born
4 sets the standard for japanese food outside japan . _ do n't _ miss it . it 's been a long time since my initial review of hana . in fact it was one of my very first on yelp . i <unk> on my <unk> requirement to get on
2 <unk> is half guinness , half harp . the best pint in the world , especially if you do n't have the room for one of each . : -rrb- + makes a great time kill while waiting for your tires to change at nearby discount tire . + awesome
3 fantastic for purists , nirvana for culinary <unk> . must have reservation . -lrb- note : <unk> impression -rrb- -- tuna sashimi , best in class . absolutely top . -- salmon sashimi , just does n't get much better unless it 's still <unk> . -- yellowtail sashimi ,
1 my dad used to take me to mary coyle 's for weekday dessert after lunching at sir george 's buffet west of central on indian school . i had to be like 3 years old . it was one of our neighborhood <unk> . a perfect birthday treat , or
2 hot wings . decent beer selection , not much on tap , wings with 12 sauce selections , great spot before or after the cine capri scottsdale -lrb- biggest screen in scottsdale -rrb- . -- some of the hottest wings i have ever had . great flavor and not too
1 bland , uninspired , boring and dark . great happy hour spot . do n't miss spicy mary . -- light provided by a cluster of 4 <unk> <unk> <unk> and candles goes for a sidewalk cafe , but it was just too dark . -- chicken gumbo uninteresting --
3 water shipped from back east makes this a crust worth the wait . order a big salad to share and have a `` tasty beverage '' ... or two ! while you wait for it . i do n't care that this one 's a chain . it 's probably
2 i 've been several times . on a weekday night , they struggled with staffing . the waitress never came by . when i say never , her job was order and deliver only . not a check on us or refill . after being done for 15 minutes ,
3 the decor is great . the burgers are cooked nicely to order . it 's a nice place to grab a quick burger and fries . right off central you have to look closely to find . the lunch crowd gets busy .
0 what is going on ? tonight out of rolls for <unk> sandwich , the substitute stale . <unk> bbq chicken salad had the worst rubber chicken . you will lose customers if you serve that rubber chicken . ick . this was a take out order . just makes me
3 always good . dan dan noodles a spicy favorite .
2 this place can be a bit crowded . they dissapointed me on st. <unk> day by selling out of soda bread by noon . hello - ! <unk> ' irish girls need bread too ! however the blueberry <unk> <unk> waffles with orange spread instead of butter make up for
2 this place lacks in atmosphere , but makes for it in price , location , and great food !!!!
4 5 stars for <unk> the only bar in phoenix where i was first scared to order a drink . but - thats why i love this place . that , and its near the trunk space .
2 we live really close , so two thumbs up for walking to the reasonably priced non dive bar . the restaurant wants to be the vig w / kids -lrb- valet service , arcadia ladies with tacky <unk> and <unk> bags -rrb- but ends up being a sort of applebees
2 <unk> kids ... yes , the hours are not the best for night <unk> - agreed . but i 'm also <unk> that scottsdale opted out . i live in arcadia and by the time i make it to <unk> washington , i could have driven to scottsdale fashion square
1 so this is a 2.5 star review kids . great parking , great hike , great view , friendly people . but come on ! the trail signage is pretty bad and <unk> . my friend and i are decently experienced hikers and we got lost twice . a 3-5
2 well , we hit this place up with a guest from out of town . richardson 's is usually our stop , but you know it burned down : -lrb- ... everything was great , except the service . the service was sort of not with it , but she
2 service is decent , food is just okay , and location is a little hard to find if you do n't know what you 're looking for . it 's a crazy fun place during happy hour - voted one of the best in phoenix .
4 i 'll be honest ... i 'm not a food connoisseur , but i know a good chicken fried steak . theirs is similar to how my mom makes it , and wow the portions are huge . and for the price ? you just ca n't beat it .
4 love the outdoor patio . sat out there on sunday with a few girlfriends , had a couple drinks . the bloody mary is huge ! great drinks , good prices , and excellent service . i ca n't remember our waitresses name , but she was a cool <unk>
4 my favorite chai ever ! they source it from nico 's in boulder , co which is where i first had it . love the spicy ginger . espresso latte is smooth and strong as well . a + service . friendly and smart !
2 it 's not a buffet , just the regular dim sum carts . not very bustling and had to wait around a bit for carts -lrb- not slow , just not <unk> like it is at busier places -rrb- but i like their sticky rice and pineapple buns a lot
1 beers are so so . it has been hit or miss in my experience . some batches are tasty , others are awful . the food is pretty much terrible here , even for bar food . i would recommend zipps over this fare <unk> . the ambiance is great
4 can not say enough about this place . the food is delicious and all dairy free . the staff is really nice and helpful . did i mention that the food is delicous ? sunday brunch is a treat and they seem to be super busy . go support local
4 yummy vegan treats ! not the most healthy but tasty and meat free .
4 if you havent been here then i am sorry . the food is beyond description and requires that you eat it before we can talk in any detail about its yum factor . let it be said that the royale with cheese it a masterpiece . excellent choices for beer
4 i was sad when ken cheuvront closed the doors here to keep his place at phx sky harbor , but pizza people is a welcomed replacement ! the first thing you need to order is one of their mac n cheese selections . whoa . i love the spicy buffalo
3 fun to hangout here during sunday football ! also fun place to watch baseball games on tv . it can get pretty busy before the phx teams have home games , but other than that it 's pretty decent . they have great specials on sunday <unk> on beer ,
4 one of my favorite dt phx joints ... ever . i 've been here several times and have always had an amazing experience . cute place , friendly staff , quick service , excellent food ... i mean , i could n't possibly ask for anything more . the first
2 their beef gyro 's are delicious ! great portions for what you pay . and their falafel is really good too . not a great portion it seems for an order of hummus , we got like one piece of pita . just did n't seem to be much there
3 i am a big fan of sonoran dogs ! i like the ones from here because they put cabbage on the dogs . the feel of the restaurant is cute ... nothing special ... you order , you sit down , eat , and get out ! it 's pretty
0 i really wanted to love malees and i did for a period of time when the desert ridge location was open and they were serving thai food . but it seems that the menu went from the classics of thai cuisine to some strange <unk> fusion which was trying harder
4 i go to france quite a bit and ironically , just arriving from paris on friday night , the wife suggested we go to la petite france to try out their `` arizona restaurant week '' menu . having just dined out in paris , i figured `` well ,
3 still the best mexican food in az . . bar none ! been here multiple times and it will continue !
3 had a wonderful dinner at j & g . great food , friendly service would return !!!!!!
3 great store ! great selection !
2 nice place ! snottsdale pricey stores .
3 i 've never been a fan or oregano 's in the past - only eaten there a couple times in the last 10 years . however , i was willing to try it again since it opened up near our hood . they have changed the menu since the last
2 the last few times we have been here , we 've sat upstairs at the bar . franco has always been our server so the last time we were there i asked him how long he had been working there - 35 years was the response . kudos franco .
4 love love love this place . we have been frequenting this place for about 10 years . it is a neighborhood staple . the food is always consistent , as is the service . the menu is small : steaks , chicken , shrimp , etc. . they are famous
1 we were excited to move into the neighborhood and find a bar and grill so close to our house ! that was <unk> . they have an outdoor patio , but no service . let me rephrase with the longest <unk> sentence ever : they start out serving you and
3 great restaurant/lounge on 7th street . i 've only had apps there as the food is not my fav -lrb- my taste buds only -rrb- . crystal , the new bartender , is awesome ! she is right on top of drinks , food , everything ! i 'm sure
4 these are the world 's greatest donuts . they had quite a few locations in the las vegas area years ago that all of a sudden closed once i got hooked . when i was <unk> to scottsdale i could not believe that i had location within a few miles
3 great food . plenty of football . awesome prices , chill atmosphere . best cheese fries in the neighborhood .
3 after a wonderful meal over at lgo pizzeria , my group and i wandered over the grocer that 's attached to the restaurant . i believe i may have actually been floored by just how cool and fun this little grocery <unk> was . it did n't really matter that
2 do n't take this the wrong way , i really do like this place . my only problem with it is that i get a distinct sense of <unk> from it . see , it 's called `` unlimited coffee '' . key word being ` unlimited ' . the
3 now , i 'm not an expert on thai cuisine . i 'm not an expert on anything really . but i know what i like . in this instance , i like this place . wild thaiger is located a few blocks north of the heard museum . as
1 i had high hopes from this place , i really did . sadly , my new favorite mexican place is not going to be this one . we arrived a little after the dinner rush on sunday and the place was packed . we were seated almost immediately , which
4 how can you not love a burger place where everything is fresh ! no freezers and a burger only costs $ 2 !!!! this location is great . they have a drive-thru that goes very fast . often they have a person waiting to take your order instead of yelling
3 the best fast-food style pan-asian cuisine in town . but the quality is really fresh . everything is <unk> made to order so you do have to wait but dishes are piping hot !! you order at the front and they give you a number that you take to your
4 wow . i can not say enough good things about this hotel . came here recently for a girls weekend trip and it was perfect . the hotel rooms were clean ... cute , perfect space for 4 girls . the pool has shaded spots with towels -lrb- although leaves
3 came here on a beautiful saturday afternoon . saw them on cupcake wars so had to try their cupcakes out . i thought it was a bakery but it turns out they 're more like a restaurant . they sell brunch items like sandwiches , omelettes and burritos . they
2 we had a friend from italy who came to visit , and heard pb is the best in town , so we thought this would be the restaurant of choice . there really is a lot of hype about pizzeria bianco that i do n't really understand now that i
3 if you 're looking for chinese groceries , this is the place for you . they do sell korean groceries ; however i would recommend asiana on dobson instead . the market is fairly large : they have produce , vegetables and meat in the back . lots of parking
4 sugar crusted brioche buns were delicious and they have macaroons in large and mini sizes . this was my first time eating a macaroon . i selected the caramel flavored one after being told it was the '' original '' -- so i was easily convinced . it was yummy
4 does n't get any better than this . my <unk> lives a few blocks away been eating here since i could eat . never disappointed ever . love their mexican taco and <unk> deserts ! great friendly service . if they cooked dirt i 'd eat it this place is
2 i feel like everytime i have come in service and quality have gone way down . im going to sauce from now on for sure .
3 the lodge has what every one is looking for in a bar in scottsdale - good bar food , sports on the tv 's , comfy booths , a pool table , unassuming interior , etc. . walking in the front door , past the 2 huge wood carved <unk>
4 great decor and service . nice to pull up curbside , walk in and always see a smiling face . wish i could buy a table for my home like the one inside , solid plank of wood . great coffee , cool environment . if you are at the
4 last night i had a friend call that was at the end of her week , her rope and needed simplicity -lrb- i never would have guessed that being called simple was a compliment -rrb- . i mentioned a few places like the vig , el chorro , even tee
4 lately , i 've been very fortunate to visit little gems that yelpers love ! this my friend 's , is one of the gems . bar bianco is quaint , cool , hip , suave , and authentic . we had just left a charity event at alice cooperstown
3 love their food , great for lunch and breakfast ... the service is a little hit or miss but they always keep your coffee cup <unk> will almost always have to ask for extra <unk> whatever . love having the breakfast sandwich or their <unk> favorite ones are no longer
4 loved our experience here ... went on nye day for a fun lunch -lrb- i had to work that night so we celebrated during the day -rrb- but it was so freaking good !!!!!!!!! me and the bf shared the beet salad which was so good and you could tell
4 went here for my bf 's birthday and man oh man was it tasty !!!!!!! the bread they serve at the beginning of the meal was amazing ... we had a nice bottle of wine , shared lobster and the special that evening with the cajun ribeye , shrimp ,
3 fun place to go and grab a drink and bite to eat , again not your typical scottsdale crowd which i love . i especially enjoy their tortilla soup and a beef taco on taco tuesday ... totally reasonable and fun spot at night . see you tomorrow cien agaves
2 i had the mozzarella tomato basil salad because my stomach had been feeling iffy the last day or so . i had a friend from out of town staying on central that wanted to do lunch , so i brought him here . it was pretty crowded for 1pm on
4 this gets 5 stars because its the best indian food i 've had in arizona . granted , all i 've been eating the last two weeks prior to this was <unk> ' hospital food , and this may <unk> the view slightly , but oh my god ! it
1 i have to downgrade this place . i feel sad about this , but the last two drinks i 've had were shitty . too much freaking milk , and not enough java . also , there are sooo many people there now , that it 's hard to get
4 `` ordinary food done extraordinarily well '' or something like that , is their motto , and you can take that to the bank . joe 's farm grill is pretty <unk> located for me -lrb- i am in north phoenix , joe 's is in southeast gilbert -rrb- but
3 my wife and i like to go to d & b because we signed up for the online mailer and get lots of coupons . we always have a good time . their happy hour specials are good , and half-price wednesday is a great value -lrb- but take note
4 total wine and more is a liquor mecca . all kinds of <unk> and <unk> under one roof , it 's beautiful . the best part is , the prices are great too . i can get a <unk> bottle of johnny <unk> black label for $ 19 sometimes ,
4 quite impressed . i wish their prices were a little lower , but the sushi room delivers in every other way . the service is fantastic , the atmosphere is terrific , and the food is outstanding . we had received some gift cards and could n't wait to use
2 this store is one that is staying open most are closing down . open pretty late and it 's pretty busy all the time it 's , so maybe if you 're in the area you can pop in just grab something on your way home to sway the store
3 <unk> tonight not busy yet but it will be later tonight . not bust yet , but will be soon fun and great drinks 2-4-1 and the beats are great for dancing . always a good time here now that it 's getting cooler out less people outside more stay
4 yes this place is always a good time and great managers .
4 i love this restaurant i used to follow the food truck . everything here is so unique . its definitely one of a kind
4 they have any kind of candy you would ever want ! last time i was here i saw chocolate covered grass hoppers lol !
2 they no longer serve the delicious cinnamon rolls and the service was kind of lacking last time i was there . this used to be our favorite downtown breakfast spot but i 'm not sure if its worth the drive from chandler now .
2 this is a nice chinese restaurant in terms of decor and style . i do n't typically see chinese restaurants like this around here and it 's a nice change . beautiful wallpaper , nice linen tables , plenty of tables and booths all with a casual atmosphere : 5
4 i will only go to harkins theaters and this one is the best yet . harkins has fresh popcorn and yummy butter flavoring , kind employees , and super clean theaters . amc on the other hand as rude workers , dirty carpet , old theaters , and gross popcorn
2 i really dislike the apple store : 1 . -rrb- they have a dumb policy where you have to make an appointment even for a minor tech question . they will literally refuse to help you even if there is no one waiting . of course there are sales people
3 i love this theater because it shows <unk> films -- often movies that are fantastic but overlooked in larger theaters -- and it 's still a harkins so $ 1 drink refills on my yearly <unk> cup and yummy popcorn . cons - mostly small theaters so they tend to
4 i love coup des tartes . it 's the restaurant i choose for birthdays and <unk> but it 's not too expensive to go anytime . best salads i 've ever had . so fresh . it 's a must to order one . i have also gotten salmon ,
3 moving from la to phx , i was hoping i 'd be able to find some great restaurants here that would help me miss the food of la a little less . i heard windsor and churn were opening up and i always love to check out a new place
3 my bf and i went to this new beer bar last night . suffice to say i 'm considering moving within walking distance . this is the bar you want in your neighborhood , luckily my boyfriend lives close by . if i could walk i suppose i 'd be
3 what a great neighborhood spot . great pizza , good prices , decent beer and a very friendly staff with great service !
3 ever since i moved to az all i want to eat is taco 's . it took 5 months for me to wander a little down to the street to find out what padre 's was all about but i 'm glad i did . they 've been open for
3 everything 's <unk> with pork belly . <unk> my belly when it 's full of it . went here for a happy hour and was <unk> myself for taking so damn long to visit the place . the vibe is perfectly sexy and dimly lit - the kind of place
3 the trek from ahwatukee to glendale is loooong , but luckily i have family in these parts , so we come here often . hands down , the best vietnamese food i 've had in the valley , no contest . the place is a very small converted house ,
3 just like the balance of color and light in a masterpiece of a painting , sacks knows how to craft a perfect balance of ingredients into a masterful sandwich . num , num , num - these are no ordinary sandwiches , and the world seems to know because the
3 i 'm gon na be that girl who <unk> a review just based on drinking -lrb- boo ! <unk> ! -rrb- but know that i am wholeheartedly returning to fully review hula 's from soup to nuts . whether soup and nuts are on the menu that night or not
4 my first experience here was short , sweet , and to the point . it was pleasurable . in other words , i had been eagerly anticipating a return . my second experience was cause enough to never return . picture this - there were perhaps 10-20 patrons in attendance
4 two times eating here and two times leaving very satisfied . the pad thai is perhaps the best i 've had in phoenix . the panang curry was nothing short of addictive . the mango <unk> rice was a delicious end to the first meal there . i believe they
4 sochu house is definitely in my top 10 , maybe top 5 , favorite restaurants in the valley . i was a little sad to see sens leave the downtown core , but they really created a great spot with sochu house -lrb- and it 's not that far away
4 a pregnant girls dream . . nom nom . super delicious . owners are very nice . staff is always very helpful and polite .
4 i love this place !!! ok . where do i start . . great place to stop in for a quick lunch . amazing outside grill , everything is good . best cheeseburger i 've ever had . i do n't even like salmon and theirs is good . good
4 this place is so great . what a hidden gem . super cheap produce with a huge selection . what would have cost you $ 40 at a normal grocery store will cost you $ 15 - $ 20 here . . you have to be picky and <unk> as
4 from the posters of arizona in old-time western movies to the unique take on each of the side dishes , bryan has done good . welcome to cave creek - we needed you . the barbeque is all excellent , particularly the pulled pork and squash . the sauce is
4 since enjoying authentic thai food in bangkok and particularly at the oriental hotel 20 years ago , i have waited for the day that a thai restaurant somewhere else approached the delicate blend of flavors of those first tastes . it happened at wild thaiger . the soup and the
4 the food and drinks at the spotted donkey are consistently good . sit outside and enjoy the sunset amidst the beauty of el <unk> and enjoy a margarita , excellent guacamole and some pepper poppers - just right . the meatloaf is a little <unk> than expected but the <unk>
4 tasting the chicken enchiladas and enchiladas de <unk> -lrb- green chile & tomatillo shrimp enchiladas -rrb- made us ask , after decades of tasting enchiladas at dozens of other good restaurants , so this is what they 're supposed to taste like ?! do n't miss the <unk> margarita .
3 after enjoying several drinks at lustre bar , upstairs at hotel palomar , my friends , aura c. , <unk> c. , and linda , all were super hungry and decided to hit this place up to take care of that problem . what attracted me to this place ?
3 this is one of my favorite pf chang 's locations because the decor looks different than the one at arrowhead and the one at keirland commons in scottsdale . the decor is very unique compared to the other ones . i love the tall ceilings and floor to ceiling windows
2 i would like to give this place 31/2 stars , but that option is n't really available now is it ? i really do love the ambiance in spite of being a chain restaurant . the sky overhead with the statue in the middle of the restaurant is a really
4 no wonder this place made one of the top 10 ice cream places in the country ! it 's a little taste of heaven !!! i got the campfire s ` more sundae with the <unk> vanilla and chocolate scoops . i 'll admit that i got it just to
3 <unk> through red fluffy clouds of cake that tastes like rich butter and <unk> salty chopped nuts sweetly nestled in a layer or two of smooth cream cheese awesomeness , the first bite of lo lo 's red velvet cake will send your taste buds on an adventure ! people
2 there 's been a long search far and wide for a phoenix area breakfast brunch , and this was one of the places we 've been eyeing for awhile . we figured anything that includes crab and shrimp on their menu had to be a pretty legit buffet , especially
4 if you havent been downtown for wine , beer , and good `` bar '' food , you need to go to the roosevelt tavern . the first time i went , i fell in love . this is a small place , so if you go on a first
4 i love this store !! i think this store -lrb- this location ! -rrb- feels like home . everyone is very nice . when you walk in the first thing you see are the beautiful and unique display of flowers . go forward and you will walk into the fresh
4 this is the new place to be every 1st & 3rd sunday of the month ! hot mess begins february 3rd . two live bands and two dj 's each time . no cover and great drink specials .
3 this is a great place to see a movie . big screen , big sound , high quality service and an experience that is lacking at most theaters . obviously only huge movies can play on this screen , but that goes hand in hand with the costs of running
3 brunch and drinks . ... do i need to say more ! brunch is $ 10 for entree and <unk> . this is a great deal for everyone . the staff at o.h.s.o. are so friendly and helpful with drink selections . they have lot 's of beers on tap
3 the biggest tiniest bar in scottsdale !!! got ta love this bar . its off the beaten path but worth the stop ! i 've been to this place a couple times and its always been a start to a great night . i remember making a stop on a
3 my favorite store ! i always go in with a list and come out with more than what i was shopping for . i love that they offer various $ 3 cheese chunks . i 've tried so many different cheeses that i probably would have skipped over . i
3 favorite place to stop after hiking camelback ! i love this tiny little place on scottsdale . its the best spot to grab a quick bit to eat or some coffee . the breakfast sandwich is the best ! i love that several of the items on the menu are
2 this is a great place to people watch if you can get through the door . kelly 's started off as a quiet bar in old town and now you must wait in line . i have to admit the drinks at the this place are great . the moscow
3 if you 're planning a party , fresh & easy is your place to stop for munchies . all their produce is fresh and quick to make party snacks . i stop in here for some quick munchies and some easy pre-made meals .
3 for three and a half years we 've lived in the valley , and for three and a half years we 've searched for the sort of reasonably priced , fresh sushi was had frequent access to in portland . some places are phenomenal but <unk> -lrb- roka akor -rrb-
3 i 'd really love to support the little mom and pop neighborhood beer and wine shop -lrb- i guess that would sportsman 's ? -rrb- but it 's kind of hard when they charge a lot and have a pretty mediocre beer selection . then total wine opened up a
3 i love what r + d is going for here : swank , some tricky mixing , and top quality drinks . my g + t -lrb- gin and tonic with the gin infused right in front of me , and a number of other <unk> -rrb- was phenomenal .
4 rum bar -lrb- and it 's adjacent restaurant , the breadfruit -rrb- is awesome . just spectacular jamaican food . the scallops were delectable , the jerk chicken was delightfully spicy , and the cocktails were fantastic . service was great , too . i recommend sitting at the bar
3 i really like this mall . its outdoors and high tech . from our lunch at cpk i could watch the <unk> game on a big screen television situated in the middle . there are a ton of stores to choose from : best buy , target , and all
3 i thoroughly enjoyed this place . we went on a saturday night so it was bustling with young people . they have every fun bar game you could imagine : pool , darts , shuffle board , air hockey , karaoke , and more . they also have <unk> on
2 we went in here tonight . we were n't really hungry so we were <unk> split a burger . we ordered the baby burger and it was incredibly small . we had to go buy another . its overpriced in my opinion . the fries were alright . i like
2 i went here to grab lunch and a beer between classes . the service was n't all that great . i do n't think the waitress ever told me her name . i ordered the fish tacos and a tall beer . they start you off with chips and salsa
4 i 'm still full after eating here . the food is really good and the service is wonderful . we ordered the bruschetta to start and then ordered a pizza and their alfredo pasta . the bill was n't ridiculous and we had a ton of leftover food . i
3 it 's a little hard to review a place when you do n't actually see the bill . that being said , i enjoyed it here . we sat up at the bar and ordered drinks . they only have a small selection of beers on draft but that 's
4 i have died and gone to <unk> heaven . walking through here i was salivating . they have everything you could ever dream of and the decor is fabulous . its chic and upper class and i do n't imagine a ton of high school kids venture here to hang
3 i somehow <unk> a coupon for this place so i decided to check it out . i told the gentleman behind the counter that i 'd never been there before and asked for his recommendations . i ended up trying the # 9 which had roast beef , turkey ,
3 i am a huge fan of the <unk> called the cupcake , as my <unk> tummy makes quite clear . sprinkles is a snazzy little cupcake joint . it reminds me a lot of <unk> 's in santana row . tons of flavors , milk , and they even have
3 i did n't even know this place existed until a coworker suggested eating here for lunch today . i was pleasantly surprised . we both got the half sandwich -lrb- brie and beef -rrb- and half soup -lrb- clam <unk> -rrb- . it also comes with chips . the portions
3 had my first `` taste '' of del frisco 's grille tonight . although some of the reviews are less than stellar , i thought the food , atmosphere and service were great . i will reserve my final blessing until i have had a full meal there ... but

4 if you are making a night out in old town , whether you 're a tourist or local this is the place to go to get that real <unk> feel . beer , grub & music are all great . get there early if you want a seat . do
3 we headed to historic downtown chandler for an art opening at the chandler center for the arts last friday night . we were a little early -lrb- of course , we planned it that way ! -rrb- , so we headed to santan brewing company for a light dinner and
3 i have only had the pizza , wings , and salad here . i have eaten here about five times , maybe more . each is wonderful ! my favorite place for this kind of food ! the pizza is great , just how i like it , soft ,
1 i did n't expect to write this kind of review , the ratings all made me think i was in for a good meal . it was n't bad , but i have to say i have had far better . the food was bland . i had the chicken
4 amazing !!!! the best coffee i have ever tasted , and the best chai i have ever tasted . i had been wanting to try it out , and i picked my uncle up from the airport and he wanted some coffee , so i knew i wanted to come
4 mmmm black tea . the best tea ever !!
4 the hubby and i came in late the other night after bingo , and we were starving . i have been wanting to come here for a while , so i was excited and it was as good as i could have expected . our waitress was so sweet ,
4 this place just keeps getting better . our waiter was soooo great this last visit . our food was amazing . we tried the bahn mi for the first time from sk , the bbq pork . it was great !! different than others i have had , but better
4 i was so impressed with our meals here ! our waitress -lrb- for dinner -rrb- and waiter -lrb- for breakfast the next day -rrb- were great , and the manager who was doing quality control was sooooo nice . he came to check and make sure we were happy and
4 i love the espresso bbq sauce , so the <unk> sandwich on wheat bun really hit the spot . the hubby had the singapore orange bowl with rice and mock chicken , he said the flavors were really good -lrb- other than the mock chicken , it was his 1st
4 i have not had a lot of vietnamese food , only pho at saigon kitchen out here in surprise , lots of boba milk tea , and spring rolls at a few places . my <unk> kept telling me about this place when i told her i want to try
4 my sis and i had a brunch day and we were going to check out dick 's hideaway , but we decided that seating might be better here at rokerij . we were seated right away , at 11 on sunday so i was happy it was n't too crowded
3 matt 's big breakfast is a nice , quaint little breakfast joint that does breakfast very well . a friend and i came here this morning and we were very much pleased with the food , the atmosphere , and the service . we both ordered the day 's special
2 salad was very stringy , <unk> , and did n't have much in the way of fresh , crispy flavor . the golden champagne vinaigrette was bland and light , did n't add much to the salad . steak was actually pretty good . a giant ol' ribeye . it
3 how have i never reviewed filmbar ? this is exactly the kind of place phoenix had needed for ages and the type of theater i craved . see , i do n't really like big box anything -lrb- stores , restaurants , etc -rrb- . and this even includes theaters
1 i have to say that while the band i saw at <unk> too 's jester room was fantastic , the venue i was not all that fond of . mind you , i can only really comment on the jester room as that is where i spent my entire visit
3 i 'm a pretty big ice <unk> fan . pretty big . i stumbled upon angel sweet for the first time with the thanks of my handy dandy gps recommending the closest place to offer me sweet cold delicious victory . angel sweet was what popped up . i am
3 some people may call this place in incomplete . . the hand painted signage on the windows that some use on their cars , the patio tables for seating inside . . the empty feel it has . i , however , think it was on purpose . some way
3 yay ! i love this place !! the decor is not only stylish and unique , but pretty much useful . i love the <unk> bins on wheels to sent condiments and napkins to the other members of your party . the rest of the interior design is great also
2 it 's nearly impossible to explain to any of you how much i wanted -lrb- and expected -rrb- to fall in love with the mim . i <unk> it clear back when it was first announced ... and when only digital <unk> were available ... when i kept wanting to
2 i 've been to the rose and crown a handful of times , usually after improv events , as it seems to be the go to place . never have i sat inside , which is always an indicator to me that a place is worthy of repeat visits .
3 i love fresh and easy and i love this store . the selection really is n't that bad for a smaller market . i can get pretty much everything i need unless i 'm shopping for a random hard to find item or something that is non food related like
2 all hail the server that gave me a to go container of the caramel popcorn on my way out ! there 's a deeper , <unk> story about the caramel popcorn . . but i 'll get back to that . now that i have your attention ... ; -rrb-
3 gallo blanco does n't serve a bad breakfast , but i 'm not sure i 'd rush back . just not really my style . my rating was a 3.5 but i 'm rounding up to 4 because of how awesome the staff was with out table of 20 +
3 the only thing i hate about this place is how many times i should be going there for lunch and forget about it . we 've ordered takeout here for work on several occasions , and just recently i was able to eat at defalco 's for the first time
3 hi , my name is <unk> and i fully endorse a good artisan ice cream place in uptown so i do n't have to force myself to trek to north scottsdale . not being able to wait any longer , i decided to venture over on the 2nd night .
3 that 's some damn good bruschetta . for those of you that are not a fan of the tomato <unk> , you know how comforting it is lately to see bruschetta that does not contain tomatoes . not only does postinos offer great alternatives , they are divine . my
2 i 've swung into echo a few times and have n't ever had a bad cup of coffee . the cappuccino is pretty solid and the zucchini bread i had for breakfast one day was a win . if i recall correctly it came in a cute little box too
3 sky harbor airport all in all is not that bad . if you 've been to other airports , you 'll clearly understand why . on my scale it 's a 3.5 , but i had to bump it up to a 4 after thinking about all the other horrid
3 this past weekend i had my staycation in phoenix for a little downtime . saturday a few friends and i wanted to go somewhere delicious no one had been and one of them suggested portlands . i had only been there for drinks a couple times , and loved the

3 so saturday morning i decide to take the trek over to scottsdale old town farmers market . started the morning off with a drive across <unk> , first time i had taken that route in daylight . it was a perfect morning with temps in the 70s . i do
3 as i thought , this place is really a 4 . i have been back a few times now and have discovered if i get there by 11:15 my food comes out pretty quick and i can take my time eating . they still only have one waitress at lunch
3 i really had a hard time rating this . the first whole foods i went to was one of the few big showcase ones in town center in las vegas . i happened to be shopping at <unk> in the same shopping center and knew i had to pick up
3 i chose this restaurant mostly based on the location for ease of getting there from fountain hills for somebody who had not been to arizona before and it 's <unk> to sweet republic . to get the minor details out of the way . i was reminded why i prefer
3 went here for a saturday smunch . they were packed but the service was still great . as things <unk> down about noon the owner came out and made the rounds of his guests . i had the chicken fried steak , scrambled eggs , potatoes , skipped the toast
2 i am not really a wine or beer snob and only tend to drink hard liquor when i am sick . the first time i found myself here was right after they opened and things were a bit chaotic and lots of empty spaces on the shelves . last night
3 my brother and his wife were staying just up the road for a few days and invited me out for dinner , like i would ever turn down dinner . : -rrb- so when i got to their hotel i brought up the <unk> and saw a bunch of places
3 met rand h and mike c and jackie c here for lunch today . for a chain they do a pretty good job of making sandwiches , salads and soups . and in the american tradition almost anything you order is more than you really need . but it is
4 i am bumping district up to 5 stars . why you ask ? the buffalo sloppy joe with tater tots . that 's why ! <unk> . it came on this <unk> bun and was the perfect mix of sloppy and tasty . the tots came in this little cast
2 so tonight i met up with some of my favorite yelpers , dallas g. , amber w. , and <unk> w. amber and <unk> are not related . so after having a couple of bites and a drink , <unk> and i were chatting with mr. chu about asian cuisine
3 i have been to the lodge on several occasions , but was reluctant to write a review before i had tried some sort of food item . beer is pretty much the same everywhere . this was the chosen spot for the <unk> hang out . like nikki f said
3 came here for my first yelp office hours last thursday . i was very impressed with the layout of the place . it is very open and you do n't feel like you are sitting on top of the stranger next to you . i feel like most coffee shops
4 i have had mamma mia 's pizza 3 or 4 times now and each time it is as good as the last . this pizza reminds me of my childhood pizza place in new york . thin crust that is well done , light on the sauce , cheese nice
3 the fashion square location is the best one i have been to out of the locations in the valley . my buddies and i have been there multiple times for day drinking and have never not had a great time . like the <unk> ? we have always gotten drinks
4 i was introduced to dicks one sunday morning and instantly fell in love . <unk> , um , i meant fell in love with dick 's hideaway . not that there is anything wrong with falling in love with dicks . <unk> . i love mexican-style food for breakfast .
1 so when i heard my brother 's friends birthday would be here , i was a little skeptical . first , i had never heard of it and second i started to research it on yelp . i was apprehensive after reading the reviews and was worried i would be
4 i love bbq and this is not just your average bbq by any stretch of the imagination . my personal favorite is the chopped brisket or the pulled pork . there 's just not one thing on the menu that i do n't just swoon over : -rrb- thanks joe
2 i have only been here a couple times but the food was really good every time . i have had the pizza and a couple of the sandwiches . all delectable !
3 i 'm not sure i love this place as much as my wife but i do have to say it was really good food when we went the other day . really busy when we were there but actually was kinda cool . we ended up sitting right next to
3 happy hour <unk> <unk> . sunday 4p to close -lrb- sometimes earlier , guess it depends when they want to open ? -rrb- . 1/2 off apps and all drinks and some select sushi stuff . sake bombs 5 bucks <unk> good atmosphere , not a very large place so
2 decent place to catch a <unk> plastered and meet random strange people . 3 bucks for a <unk> lite . . <unk> night beer pong . just dont touch your lips to those cups . .
2 update -lrb- may 2009 -rrb- : i tried liberty for breakfast and they have a good selection ... the chorizo egg dish was great . my kids loved the pancakes . i 'm still iffy on other food , i 'll have to give it another try , but the
3 hard to find real italian food in arizona . let 's face it everyone can claim it , but hard to match ny style italian . brio , being a chain itself , rises above the other chains and offers some higher quality italian cooking . my wife always gets
0 the bartender was going off on the ladies next to us who returned a dish because it had no turkey in it . when returned to the kitchen the 3 mexican guys in the kitchen were totally talking bs about the customers . in spanish . unprofessional and bad .
3 cool spot ! the good amazing selection of beers decent deals for micro pitchers awesome arizona burger good location the bad horrible beef brisket sandwich - sent it back . it was just super dry . maybe just an off day . flatbread pizzas are decent at best . everything
3 this is a quality thai buffet i have been going to for many years . only downside is the best dishes they only bring to the buffet in small quantity and it gets picked over completely if you are n't the first 3 people there . they should make the
1 meh . most inconsistent place in the valley ! been here 4x and different experience each time . last pizza we ordered was totally burnt . line was too long to even bother taking it back . they are now resting on their laurels .
0 $ <unk> for one cheeseburger with bacon split into 2 . need i say more ? i think not . the waffle fries were very good that came with the burger and the bartender was very friendly . the bottom line is this place is very expensive . also the
2 decent sushi and super nice staff and owner . the rice is not quite washed enough times to be mushy enough to not fall apart . the rise is basically like rice you would eat chinese food with . this is the only complaint . good place and its tough
3 enjoyable all around but it 's loud . <unk> is all surprisingly very good here . almost as good as the beers !
2 really great food here , reasonably priced . the thing that prevents us from going back to this place is the service and the employees . hipster heaven ! they could truly care less about their customers . especially the guy waiters . one spilled beer right in the middle
3 great pizza and the waitress was so patient with us , as we closed up the place . we had one of their pizzas with sausage on it and it was out of this world . the wine selection was pretty good and was in a hip and comfortable setting
3 you had me at hello . you had me at hello ... for me -lrb- and my dad -rrb- , i am all about first impressions , and if you have bad salsa than i am not likely going to return . or if you make me pay for my
3 if you 've read any of my reviews , it 's no surprise that i take into account the fact that valle luna is what it is ... it 's not backed by some culinary genius mixing up roasted pepper <unk> to top off a taco . this is downright
3 do n't you wish your girlfriend was elite like me ? because if she was , she would have taken you to the oye which would remind you how awesome and az authentic this place actually is ! rustler 's rooste is thee place to take out of town guests
3 although i did n't need retail therapy , i started off with one at modern steak . a small but tasty martini served with a carafe on the side containing a separate <unk> for <unk> ice - -lrb- awesome -rrb- . <unk> , grand <unk> , strawberry , basil &
3 the view alone bumps this to a 4 star . i have lived in the valley for over 10 years and i finally visited the compass restaurant . a spectacular view of the city at sunset could n't have been more perfect . the food was really good , although
3 i definitely go here when i 'm in the area ... good flavors and quality food for a reasonable price .
3 i 've been going here since the week it opened . the food is better than average , somewhere halfway between authentic mexican and americanized . i love the salsa selections and the chips are good . the food is nothing spectacular but i will go here on occasion just
3 great park , lots to do for the kids and places to have a party . they do need to put a sun cover over the swings ... they get too hot .
1 overall : <unk> ambiance : 4.5 food quality : 4.0 food quantity : 3.5 value : 2.5 conclusion - i may try again but this experience was such a let down i might spend my $ elsewhere instead . what i tried : scallops - <unk> , not recommended !
2 food is fairly authentic island food ... it is ok , nothing fantastic . then again , not much island food is ` fantastic ' anyway . if you love island food , go here . if not , you are not missing anything .
0 average quality , barely , and lacking in taste and originality . the chains , which i 'm no fan of , beat this place easily . there were a lot of families here ... they must have cheap kids menu or something .
4 awesome place ... a bit on the expensive side but all the food is very good and so are the sweets .
3 costco ... yup !
2 harlows is a nice little <unk> and lunch place in the heart of the tempe college area . its not in my normal 3 square mile radius so it took me <unk> to finally come here after it being recommended by a good friend a ways back . i 'm
1 the armadillo grill really surprised me . a dive bar in the midst of all the pretentious restaurants and shopping center around the baltimore area . a resturant / bar with pool tables and a bunch of tv 's with sports . i love dive bars , however , i
1 the bar is nice as a bar , but thats all this is , a bar , that plays country music . lame ! no dancing ? way lame ! the screens and tv 's are huge . we watched the <unk> / <unk> fight here and really liked the
2 you arcadia folks are going to love kitchen 56 . remodeled inside an old car / mechanical repair shop this place has tons of character . they kept pictures of the old mechanic shop up around for nostalgia and makes a good conversation starter if you bring a friend who
4 best pizza in the valley . handle this !
1 i 'll be short , and just get to the point on this one : the only reason i managed to give this place 2 stars was because they definitely gave you good sized portions for the price . however , a large portion of nasty , is still just

3 it had been ages since i 'd been to chen wok -lrb- as i had previously called it bc i had no clue all these years that there was an '' & '' -rrb- and it was like i stepped into a time warp . nothing about the place had
3 early <unk> when <unk> croque <unk> sourdough bread <unk> slice and <unk> <unk> . the fresh squeezed oj , with rebecca 's early bird <unk> <unk> fruit pieces , nuts , and cinnamon granola , <unk> out a great meal .
4 i have been to this oregano 's a bunch of times now and love the food ... you will want to come early for dinner it 's always really busy ... the staff is always friendly and will seat you as fast as they can ... i always order something
2 i had gone to this place right after guy was there and i ordered the # 1 combination 3 tacos server with rice and beans i picked a carne asada , lengua and a <unk> ... i remember not being so blown away i was really disappointed . so fast
3 i am a meat eater so when someone told me about this mock chicken sandwich i had to try it . we arrived to a pretty packed house it looked like a pretty hip crowd of people . everyone was really friendly and nice we both ordered the secret bbq
1 once again come on guy you must be eating different food then they serve me ... i have given joe 's farm grill two try 's now and not impressed with the long lines to everything there ... frist visit ordered the same meal guy did ahi tuna sandwich -lrb-
3 some days on the way to work i will make a stop here ... i order the same thing the southwestern bagel sandwich it 's always really good i would say split it with someone it 's really a lot of food plus it comes with a cup of fresh
3 i have gone to this spot a few times now it 's always really busy at lunch ... it 's really loud in the restaurant i found it hard to order . i ordered the bacon cheeseburger toppings a. 1 .  steak sauce , jalapeno peppers , green peppers
2 jimmy john 's is an interesting place . it 's tucked in between the new five guys and the fat tuesday and they offer free smells . so at least there 's that . the staff is exceedingly friendly and always greet you when you enter . you 'll also
4 <unk> is at once chic , urban , fun , and just enough scottsdale without making me want to stab myself in the face , as a <unk> , overweight guy . you 'll first notice the atmosphere , and with good reason -- it 's perfectly lit , with
4 let me start by <unk> that my five stars are for lunch on mill . rula bula is a bit of a <unk> lunch place : if you 've gone at night when school 's in , it is very clearly a `` get <unk> '' frat boy crazy kind
1 pallets needs a bit of work . the decor is fun , but i could 've done without mma on the tv . that said , the service was fine , the tea was fine , and my pork fried rice was decent . the egg rolls were also decent
3 great place , delicious breakfast , relatively cheap . sad that they do n't use real maple syrup , but their cinnamon buns are amazing and their scrambles are top-notch .
4 welcome diner in its latest incarnation is a gem . their new hours make them far more accessible for dinner service , but you 'll still want to plan on showing up relatively late , at least during the summer , as most of their seating is outside . the
4 i first sampled chef beckett 's food at staff meal at petite maison . he had cooked up an amazing grilled cheese with pancetta and tomato bisque . happily , that 's on the menu at his own restaurant , which just opened this last week . the girlfriend and
3 it 's not casey 's . it 's just not . not even close . if you can get past that . i think the food is better . guinness pours are on par with casey 's , and they have live music . sometimes it 's even good !
3 i used to think the stereotypical italian grandmother who asks if you 're hungry and then feeds you regardless of your answer , and then feeds you again , and then makes you a sandwich , and then brings you a canolli , and then packs something for you to
4 as if this place needs more high marks . i used to drive by the place all the time and my so at the time used to joke about cornish pastys being what cornish strippers wore in non nude establishments . all i can say is yum ! so one
0 i have not eaten here but fear not the place is closing and they are getting out . . harry does n't know what he 's doing and it shows by the reviews . . the kid is no peter hopefully he will continue to do what he does best
4 just went last night and all i can say is yahoo yasu ! if you have n't been get going ! great fish and the duck some of the best i had . very simple full of flavor . music got loud as the night wore on . portions are
4 hands down the best pizza , best ingredients in all of phoenix . this place is 100 % authentic and must be tried . puts humble pie to shame and give bianco a run for his money without a doubt . it is a new spot and the service means
3 it 's cold like always in theater .
3 the new pizza shop was closed , so plan b was dos gringos . the service was great . i had no compliments . i would go back again .
4 was looking for club dress and they had a great selection .
4 went back for a happy hour anniversary celebration . enjoyed 3 dozen fresh oysters , lobster & shrimp bisque , crabcakes and excellent , attentive service by amanda ! dessert for special occasions is complimentary -lrb- good to know -rrb- ! this is still one of our favorite places in
3 this place has become our `` go to '' place after hiking camelback every weekend for the past 4 -lrb- soon to be 5 -rrb- weekends ! the pastries are very good . this last time we had the egg , bacon , avocado & cheese breakfast sandwich on a
4 how have i gone this long without reviewing the lodge ? sheesh ! i get all <unk> inside when i think about the lodge . the mac and cheese is not something to play around with . it is a dish of fantastic , cheesy <unk> . also , please
3 i came to fez for a birthday party , and was quite pleased really . the decor was very modern , and the restaurant had a good vibe to it . there was a party of about 20 of us , and they had no problem accommodating seating arrangements .
3 my best friend and i just experienced drift for the first time on saturday , and we had a great time ! we had the spinach artichoke dip , and it was to die for . absolutely delicious , and it was only $ 5 or somewhere in that neighborhood
3 i 've had a good first experience at the stand ! their food is all fresh , made to order . i love that . the menu is simple and to the point , with a few extra ingredients like caramelized onions and grilled jalapeo for flair on your burger
3 i stopped by chop shop one sunny afternoon , and after i finished ordering i inquired to the young girl behind the counter how things are going . she replied `` well , good . in fact , most people who came here on day one still come back almost
3 i love this place ! thanks to yelp i learned of it 's existence . my wife and i lived in the sf bay area for 14 years and were pretty spoiled when it came to chinese cuisine ... have tried a few places in the valley and china chan
2 as you can tell by my other reviews i seldom frequent large factory restaurants . . but , when driving around keirland trying to make up your mind what to eat at close to 8:30 pm , p.f. changs to the rescue ! my wife and i sat at the

2 go during happy hour or you are not getting a deal the food is a-okay . but not a place i would ever `` crave '' basic greek and pita food nothing crazy . . what i do love about this place is the decor .
4 i love love love this place ! top reasons why i love this place : - the americana theme - best happy hour in the valley - service is outstanding : -rrb- i had a philly <unk> -lrb- : its not a fancy place but it is a place you
3 spicy noodles were delish . service was great food is out fast what more can you want ? perfect place for lunch with friends -lrb- :
3 a great place to enjoy the patio for lunch or a $ 5 glass of wine before 6pm ! obviously , the wines offered for $ 5 are not the best and highest priced ones from the regular menu , but it 's still a great deal . the small
1 consistently disappointing <unk> our experiences here . the chips and salsa -lrb- ask for hot salsa -rrb- and inferno sauce are the only positive factors at this restaurant . my husband and i have ordered food here numerous times and each time leave shaking our heads wondering why we did
2 a great late night spot when you 're looking to stay out of old town , but not a place that i would make it a point to dine at otherwise . for several years , `` the bat cave '' has been our late night stops after concerts ,
4 yep , good ol' simple home cooking , and by ` home cooking ' i mean back when no one cared that there was about three cups of butter in per serving . if you 've never gone , do n't be scared off by all the butter references ,
1 i 've been driving past this intriguing little place for years now , and finally stopped in to satisfy my curiosity . i had been warned by a friend that it was not worth going for lunch , as the food was n't very good , but i was craving
3 if you live in tempe , this has to be a staple to your menu . good , fat sandwiches on thick slices of toasted bread . always have new england chowder - and you get the bread bowl even if you get it to go , very nice .
4 impressed on so many levels with this <unk> gem in phoenix . i had heard of richardson 's , and for my friend 's going <unk> birthday dinner , he requested that we go to richardson 's `` other restaurant . '' like any good yelper i checked its profile
3 i was really impressed with this <unk> cafe . i think i committed three moving violations in two minutes trying to find a place to park and being trapped on the southbound side of central -lrb- stupid awesome light rail ! -rrb- . on an aside , anyone else not
3 the food is fantastic , the only reason i detract a star is for ambiance . it 's all down home , country themed -lrb- country as in floral curtains , not music -rrb- . and it 's popular with the over 50 crowd ... so , not my breakfast
3 this bar is nice and laid back , with thrift store decor and spacious patio and inside area . the bar staff is super cool and sans attitude at this scottsdale late night eating staple . i think they were voted `` cutest , girl next door waitresses '' in
4 i 'm really into this bar , but only every now and then . they get a lot of the same kinds of requests , and they usually play them on rotation each weekend , so i would n't recommend coming every week . the musicians are good and have
4 my boyfriend took me here on my <unk> after several strong suggestions from his coworkers for a nice , romantic option . and i was blown away ! if you 've been to house of tricks in tempe , expect the same crowd , decor/atmosphere and price , and the
4 nothing can replace the original postino 's , but this central ave. location comes pretty close . perfect little lunch spot featuring your favorites -lrb- i.e. bruschetta planks in all the varieties , yummy paninis and plenty of wine -rrb- and my personal favorite part , the smokin ' $
3 the kids who work here are always good looking and nice , a rare and appreciated combination . i steer clear two months before and two months after christmas , the line is too much . i did happen to go mid december to pick up a new ipod since
3 i first started hitting up the alley at age 15 , when i was finally allowed to go to shows ... ha , it was the height of ska -lrb- i mean the height of ska before it hit uber mainstream and <unk> rocked <unk> big fish in their opening
4 this is sprawling , brand new `` campus '' located right in downtown mesa . performing arts stages , galleries , classes , restaurants ... this <unk> campus is a really , really nice venue to do anything . my architect friend said the campus was a little ... over
4 i was really impressed with this place . it reminded me a lot of plaid in tempe , but without the <unk> attitude from <unk> and dingy , <unk> atmosphere . the food was delish - i had vegan crab puffs -lrb- wow , these were good ! -rrb- and
3 after two years of going to postino 's and thinking every time , ' i have to try this place soon , ' i finally lost my <unk> -lrb- pronounced `` <unk> '' ; i did n't know either until i caught one of their chefs on a morning news
2 pretty good place to buy or sell used books , cds , movies , etc. i have n't really been since the <unk> of <unk> , but i always <unk> <unk> over this place for atmosphere , authenticity of `` record '' shop and staff .
1 food was alright . i got the clams with linguine in white sauce . i prefer whole clams with their shells in this pasta dish but the one here came with the canned clams . it was a little too greasy for my taste and it had too much parmesan
1 small breakfast menu ... probably a better place for lunch due to more choices . i got the san <unk> omelet -lrb- which the cashier said was their best seller -rrb- . it was nothing spectacular and needed more veggies . i also got the iced coffee and thought it
2 probably the first mexican restaurant i ate at upon moving to the east valley . i 'm a bit of a connoisseur now since i 've eaten at a hundred other joints since then . great carne asada . probably in the top ten . burros are fab and their
1 food is okay but not worth the lengthy wait on weekends . if there were more breakfast choices around this area , tbc would be empty . i 've ordered breakfast on two occasions here and both times it came out cold , plus the order was messed up .
2 happy hour <unk> <unk> 6 pm weekdays . there must have been 30 guys and maybe 5 chicks on two different occasions . whoa ! i like the specials and love the malibu accessories spread across the walls . way to get my attention !!
3 wow . my new favorite spot . the fried chicken is fab !! -lrb- our server called it comfort food , hahaha !! -rrb- so is the canolli . just make sure you tell them to ditch the mushrooms if that 's not your thing . they do n't tell
3 the amc does a great job of using multiple theatres for the blockbuster movies . although they are usually all quite full , i 've never run into the disappointment of not getting to see a movie because it 's only in one theatre . the staff is super friendly
3 i 've been frequenting this place for a <unk> time . it reminds me of the funky artsy <unk> in la , around the melrose district . their <unk> of furniture - midcentury <unk> line the walls and old <unk> tables - complement the easy , laidback vibe of the
2 seems to always be <unk> out old places and in the new . hard to keep up , but at least there are always options . .
2 lunched here today . . i can not recall what the place used to be called , but it was something else last time i was here . . anyways , i digress . . the decor of the place fits right along with what you 'd expect based on
4 i had the cajun last week with a giant <unk> cider . . the food was awesome . pasties are typically pre-made , although by pre , i think they mean within the last 20-30 minutes . . mine was fresh out of the oven . so delicious . never
3 stopped at sam 's for a work lunch . great location . it 's good to have places like this downtown . everyone in our group enjoyed the food . from the variety of pre-meal chips , the entrees , and the post meal white chocolate tamales . i had
3 in my quest to try all the restaurants on 7th street near my house , i decided to check out pizza heaven . pizza heaven is another one of those hole-in-the-wall eateries that you hear about via <unk> . oh sure , i can sit here and <unk> out <unk>
3 mmm , lux . some of the best coffee in phoenix . the interior is <unk> as new artists are featured on its walls and the furniture is <unk> on a regular basis . beans are fresh roasted on the premises so you know it 's fresh and not <unk>
3 qcumberz is the first business i 've gotten to review with both of those <unk> used letters z and q in its name -lrb- sorry , quiznos , maybe i 'll get to you eventually -rrb- . this place looks small , but it just keeps going and going ...
4 this little hole in the wall has delicious sandwiches ! they have a huge collection of old school sodas and you can turn any one into a float .
2 sandwiches are great but both times the service has n't been good ... kinda leaves a bad taste .
4 the huge screen and <unk> digital <unk> make this an awesome theater to see a blockbuster film in . all harkins theaters are great because their concession stand does n't rip you a new one when you show up -lrb- yay loyalty cups ! -rrb- , but this theater is
2 we 've been a few times and think it 's a fun place to bring people from out of town . i honestly felt that the steak quality was no better than outback , but at least they have ambiance and live music . awful parking though !! use the
3 i 've been to the big bang a few times , always on a fri or sat night . each time has been great . the dueling pianos are fun to hear and go back and forth . the players do an excellent job of getting the crowd going .
3 great place for breakfast or lunch . i really like the low carb menu . friendly staff . get there early as there can usually be a long line because of the great food .
1 i recently went to gb on a tuesday night with some friends for a drink or two around 8 pm . the place was not busy at all . there were only a few patrons here . the place was a ghost town . we sat down in the cocktail
3 ever since i 've been introduced to mongolian grill , i 've been hooked . this is the only place i 've gone to in az i like that the bowl of food is one price and includes rice , soup , drink and soft service yogurt . kids price
2 i 'd give pita jungle 3.5 stars . my wife loves this place . i enjoy the food , but not quite as much as she does . the cost of an entree is very reasonable and you get a pretty large portion of food . i 've had the
3 just moving into the neighborhood , <unk> caught my eye and i had to stop by this establishment and see how the food was . i tried the gyro plate and enjoyed my meal . i 've had bigger gyros , but this gyro tasted great and will be going
4 scottsdale stadium is an awesome ballpark ! yes , i 'm a bit biased since i 'm a relocated giants fan living in arizona . even a non giants fan would appreciate the stadium and great location to watch a game . you know the stadium is a draw for
4 this review is strictly for the desserts . i 've eaten a cookie from lgo before and was excellent . who knew apple oatmeal would taste so good ! being my first time at the actual location , i was able to see the various selections of cakes , cookies
2 large menu to choose from , food arrived quickly and were kind enough to bring out to the table outside . that was a nice touch . clean dining area . the gyro i had was good . solid , but not the best i 've had . there was
2 good to very good yogurt , but not the best i 've had . had plenty of toppings and fresh fruit to choose <unk> use more flavors .
3 after working down the street from freddy 's for a year and half and wanting to go , i finally went with a coworker who raved about the place . i ordered the # 1 combo , burger , drink and fries . the meal was just under $ 7
1 service here is always friendly , and it 's a pleasant place that offers a lot of fish for the buck . go for fish over lobster or shrimp , as you get more food for the buck , and it tastes good going down . plus , salsa bar
3 beautiful bountiful burger ! this mildly <unk> diner is the one inexpensive eatery in old town , so i walked in with low expectations but left delighted -lrb- and very full -rrb- . trying the texas burger appears to be almost mandatory among yelpers , and a very fine burger
3 the food always seems to get better with each trip . of course when i leave im stuffed and feel like im going to explode . that 's my own fault . . i like this location . we are always seated pretty quickly . if we have to wait
3 my girlfriend and i hit this place up during the horror & sci-fi film festival this weekend . i ordered the bacon cheeseburger and she picked up a regular cheese burger with onions and mushrooms ... also grabbed a small fry . i got ta say the taste of these
4 oh , where to begin . . i stopped by pappadeaux last week to grab a bite when on a wed , they told me it was a 45min wait for two . . wow . the place was packed . the hostess recommended we make a reservation for the
2 i gave my first review of this establishment back on nov 2010 and as for the food , it still stands as a great time . the food is delicious . id like to review the visit this time . my <unk> and a friend all went to kabuki for
4 decided to go here because of the reviews here . . picked up the lucky burger with 1000 island dressing , took a bite and literally said . . `` my god that 's a good burger ... '' and had to pause to write this real quick . i
3 some might walk into freddy 's and think . . `` hey this is like culvers . . '' sure , they both sell burgers and custard , but i tell ya what . . freddy 's burgers are far tastier and the custard is out of this world .
4 ive been wanting to try this place for years . this year was my 40th birthday and what a better place to try than fogo . my girlfriend and i made reservations with her brother and wife . what i loved is when we showed up , we were seated
3 this is the first nypd i believe and i was here on opening day . back then the pizza was insanely good and overall it still is . we went here for dinner while we doing hell city at the biltmore . figured it was cheaper than spending $ 200
2 okay , i 'm not going to be as harsh this time . i have been here several times since the my <unk> incident below . i strongly suggest that you go during the day if you want <unk> . after dark , the night crew does not put as
3 a few weeks ago , i saw a kid at lunch at my school with a `` seriously '' big slice of pizza . i asked him where he got it and he showed me the soda cup that came with it . jimmy & joe 's eh ? got
4 $ 9 , all you can eat . no , that 's not just the lunch special , that 's the buffet price all day long . we 're talking fantastic , authentic indian food here . great variety of taste , lots of vegetarian options , tasty naan ,
4 this is the superior of the two <unk> in the valley . on my most recent visit , i had a meat lover 's plate -- 2 sicilian meatballs , an italian sausage , and penne pasta , all in a fantastic meat sauce . probably the best plate of
1 they burned my eggs . i never had a place burn my eggs before . the original pancake house is a very <unk> restaurant attached to a motel 6 in the middle of scottsdale . the place reminds me of the joints that my parents would take me to for
2 some friends of ours were looking to have pizza at a place that offered a gluten-free option . a quick search on yelp revealed picazzo 's and we were off and running . i 'll get to the <unk> tax on this one . the pizza was very good and
4 i can not say enough about carolina 's . by far the best mexican joint in town . it 's nothing to write home about in terms of atmosphere , but that 's part of the experience . my favorite foods : - any burrito , enchilada style with red
4 love my bevmo . i can always find what i want here . service is great . prices a great . my only complaint - i have a kiddo and it would be helpful if they offered to help me get the booze into my vehicle . other than that
2 mojo is a nice treat in the spring or summer and a good excuse to take a stroll on the sidewalks of citynorth . however , the teenagers that work there are not very customer service oriented , the yogurt is just satisfactory , and the <unk> concept can come
2 last night was my first night at ck 's tavern & grill . the place was packed which is a great thing for any business in our current economy . that tells you a lot about it . i have to say the staff was outstanding ! the food was
3 hot dogs ! you either love em or hate them . i have to say ted 's are some of the best . i always have the all beef and change up the toppings . there are a lot of toppings to chose from and do n't forget to order
4 i was in heaven here and had a great time with my friends for lunch . the prices were n't bad and the food was so good i did n't want to stop eating , of course i had to or i was going to explode . i have to
1 pretty fun breakfast with my fav 's . alas i could only give it 2 stars because it did n't knock my socks off . our server seemed nice enough , but definatly not going for any server of the month awards . if it 's your cheat day ,
3 sexy atmosphere . yummy food . great date spot ... save room for the red velvet cake !
3 we biked down after work today to try out fuego 's newest restaurant , and if you know me at all though , you know my real motivation was the froyo next door . it was the `` let 's try out the new fuego '' that convinced my wife
2 i have never been into harkins camelview before , and was n't extremely delighted with the theater itself . seemed like a blast from the past , sort of old , dark and dreary . i like that they exclusively show <unk> <unk> films , so if you 're into
3 i have a hard time deciding what to write about angels trumpet , not being a fan of beer , it 's hard to give any of the breweries around town a fair shake . on their menu they 've got items like spam sliders , home made pop tarts
2 lets just set the record straight here . zoe 's serves mediterranean just like qdoba serves mexican . when i say just like the q , i mean the entire experience . walking into the shop gives more of a cookie cutter national chain feel ; which is probably because
3 i was looking for a place to listen to some cool and funky live music and <unk> hit the spot . soul power seems to be a staple here , and they did n't dissapoint . the place is kind of a dive , reasonably priced libations , fun atmosphere
3 a solid choice for any froyo lover ; but i find it hard to visit with mojo only 2 blocks away . i just ca n't stay away from mojo with their b1g1 free yelp check in , which shows from my huge -lrb- # of check-ins there -rrb- .
2 had their tacos and a margarita . was dissapointed with the marg , the tacos were decent . prices seemed a bit steep for the tacos , they were small but the price was big . all in all , i would n't specifically avoid this place , but i
3 sweet potato fries are <unk> sight and they do their fez <unk> just right . they 're the cenpho hot spot for lunch , dinner and late night ! i 've had their burgers , pita pizzas , and salads . the atmosphere is cool and eclectic and the staff
3 lola is one of those solid coffee shops that is a destination from just about anywhere in the valley . they 're a nice destination for anyone within a few mile radius ; walk , run or ride , they keep a bike rack out front . pop over whenever
2 found myself in the area today and needed a few basic items so i stopped in . this place is certainly a marketplace ! i felt as if i was shopping in another country almost . it was kinda fun and a bit intimidating . but an experience worth taking
1 yikes we had my adopted father mr. <unk> funeral banquet here a year ago . today it got 6 violations and a warning from the health dept to clean up or close down ! even then i thought the food was so-so . many things were <unk> presented but did
2 it 's nice to know that when you are assigned to bring wine to a friends dinner party and you are n't much of a fine wine <unk> you can go here ask for a bottle you may have tried 3 or more months ago and actually find it .
4 my review is on the sprouts sandwich counter only . i do n't shop here or at any of the locations at this point because none are in walking distance of home . but i was in with a friend and we grabbed sandwiches at the counter . they were
1 i have given it a few tries , but it just leaves so much to desire ! a neighborhood store is suppose to have personality . where is the familiar clerks , produce guy , kid that helps with your grocery working <unk> first job and others ? where are

4 i do n't crave cupcakes often but when i do , i go to sprinkles . location is great , right off scottsdale road and camelback . lines can get long though -lrb- just means it 's that good -rrb- so i would n't suggest coming if you 're in
3 i am a big fan of yc 's ! i love the wide variety of options for your bowl and the wonderful sauce options . i particularly like the soups , rice and chips with sweet and sour sauce !! i could eat bowl after bowl of those chips with
3 i really enjoy this place ... been now a few times and have had good experiences . i recommended coming here with a friend who was visiting from out of town to grab a drink and she was also impressed . the house margarita with a <unk> float is great
3 i came here on a saturday night to watch an asu game and have a nice dinner . it 's located right off scottsdale road , easily visible from the street . there was no wait when we came -lrb- around 8pm -rrb- but very packed . we were seated
4 after signing up for their e-mail list , i was pleasantly surprised to find a $ 25 coupon sitting in my e-mail for my birthday . i had only been to the keg once before -lrb- a very long time ago -rrb- so i was very excited to try again
4 huge transformation !! i remember the <unk> movies theatre growing up as a staple place to go for movies . once the economy went <unk> , so did this theatre . . until <unk> 've been twice since they re-opened . i went to see a g rated movie and
3 i went here today for the first time with a friend and i really enjoyed the `` betty boop '' . it came with one big waffle and a chicken <unk> . the waffle was good , tasted like cinnamon , and the chicken was juicy and delicious ! i

3 love , love , love their buffalo grilled wings and buffalo chicken strips . the only other thing i 've had was the pizza and it was , eh , okay . they do have a great happy hour , if you like margaritas . service is good .
1 i 'm usually a big fan of dive bars but was n't impressed , at all . one of the kegs was empty so my friends did n't get their `` favorite '' beer , not a huge deal but not a good thing for 5pm on a friday .
2 i had a hankering for raw fish today and decided to give moto a try . overall i was pleased . the menu had a wide variety of tempting asian treats but i was here for fish , so i ordered the sashimi combo with a bowl of miso .
2 more like 3.5 stars , and i easily see this rating going up . on my weekly pilgrimage to chaparral park -lrb- damn demanding dog ! -rrb- i pass sabai . being in need of some spicy food i decided to bite the bullet . sabai used to be a
2 let me start by saying the food here is five star . everything i ate was delicious and i plan on coming back for more . the down side ... service sucked . my server was the <unk> of good . he took my order then promptly ignored me .
2 ah , the gut bomb . what better way to repair the damage done after a hard night of partying than country gravy ? jerry 's has become my go to spot for post party breakfast . the restaurant is clean and the service is usually quick . imagine the

3 true bbq is bbq that does n't need sauce to make it taste good . this place does an excellent job at doing just that . the meat comes in its <unk> form - straight off the bbq or smoker . you put your own sauce on . we had
3 unfortunately it was a while since i ate here but forgot to write this review sooner . overall i was pretty pleased with their food here . their agedashi tofu was done in a way that was so different from the typical . the sauce was actually a mushroom broth
3 very nice library . cool staff , good selection , easy to order items they do not have there . chill place to kick back as well . just wish they did n't have that $ 1 fee if you forgot to pick up an item on hold ... .
4 most people over the age of 21 have had some sort of <unk> experience . by themselves , with someone else ... whatever . the reason i mention this is that the food here has been so good in my experience , my taste buds have exploded with <unk> .
3 great place with a cool college vibe . the rolls are unique to the community and the service is awesome ! $ 1.50 beers during happy hour !
1 maybe it 's because this location is on mill avenue , but i 've had better . the sushi is average , the prices are higher than normal , and the service is poor . we called ahead to schedule a larger group and the hostess told us she ``
3 what an amazing place ! from the moment you pull up , the vibe at jobot is unlike any other coffee shop i 've been to in phoenix -lrb- or ever , for that matter ! -rrb- . located in the heart of roosevelt row , this lovely place fits
4 another one of joe 's <unk> . i eat here whenever in the area . casual atmosphere . great food ; their rice pudding is excellent ; great hamburgers and sloppy joes . alway a good place to go for great food at a reasonable price . you have to
3 great place to visit and check out the olive oil products available in addition to their food and desserts . stop by relax and enjoy the activity . you will not be disappointed . a jewel in the <unk> valley .
3 great place to have good a meal ; the set up of aunt chilada 's works well for private parties ; good outdoor seating as well . i think you will enjoy the experience .
3 i like grazie , it 's a great little pizza and wine spot to have a nice dinner date . we ordered a pitcher of sangria and shared a <unk> alla mamma pizza which was thin crusted and flavorful . i am a big fan of ricotta cheese and the
3 ok , ok ... yes , i am from southern california , and yes , i am a born and raised <unk> fan , but more importantly i am a lover of basketball , period . so now that that 's out of the way , i can give my
4 piestewa peak has definitely become one of my favorite hikes here in arizona . with my beloved camelback put on the side <unk> while under construction , we have substituted piestewa to fill in the <unk> . this hike , in my opinion , is the hike most similar to
4 this is my favorite breakfast spot in arizona hands down ! every time i have visitors from out of town i suggest this for breakfast . even when they were at the smaller location i would bring my friends from ca there when i used to live in downtown .
4 had dinner here with my bf 's family and i really enjoyed the food ! first , we had the pretzel appetizer that the waiter recommended and it was fairly addicting . it was so fresh we had to wait a while for it to cool down . it came
3 this is another bar we like to hit when we do n't want to get all dressed up and instead have a `` shorts and flip flops '' kind of night . the specials are awesome and they have some fun games like giant connect four . me and the
3 the stand holds a special spot in my heart before i even tried their food since this is the old location of maui dogs , and that 's where i had my first date with the <unk> . that 's what made it even more satisfying to find that the
4 i love coming to crescent mostly because i get to hang out with loved ones when i 'm here . my bf 's hipster brother lives <unk> and we do n't get to see him often , so i 've always had a good time catching up with him here
4 we 've since gone back a few times , and i have to say they have one of the best burgers in phoenix . and the cheese fries are great , too !
4 this place serves the best hot and sour soup ever !! the atmosphere was clean and modern , the food was fresh and so flavorful , and the service was quick and polite . this is officially my favorite chinese food restaurant now . it 's located in a strip
3 let me start by saying this place is really hard to find ! even with my trusty gps i found myself walking in circles and calling , calling , calling . i 've seen many complaints about service on here , and while my service was not bad in terms
3 ok , so i think i 'm going to say i like this place even more than i did before . all because it is clear you have to be adventurous and try different things on the menu before you really make a judgment . on my second visit ,
2 when i sat down at the table with my boyfriend , who happens to really like this place , i really felt like i 'd found another cool gem in phoenix . a somewhat <unk> decorated little `` cave '' this is , i settled in on good conversation before
3 <unk> 's kitchen is a really cute restaurant serving a type of chinese cuisine that 's hard to come by ! the ladies who own the restaurant are always there , one making buns and dumplings , and one running the front of the house . when asked what to
3 the caramel macaroons here are to die for ! that being said , this is a very cute restaurant , though the venue is a tad small ! be prepared to wait for a table if you get there at lunch time but the food is worth it . it
1 burrito excellent ... linguini not so good ... but i liked the walnut `` meatballs '' . for <unk> i 'm far from a vegetarian , i prefer a juicy burger .
3 no this is not a gourmet burger shop ... it 's just a down and dirty , greasy , meat and bun burger , <unk> your arteries type of burger ... . . but it is good and cheap !
4 wow ... the food was very good and it seemed very authentic since there were what appeared to be cambodian clients ... yes <unk> <unk> is part of my search of authentic dishes . the signature fish dish was excellent and the service was very good . i also tried
3 reminds me alot of cucina tagliani -lrb- a small chain of italian restaurants in the west valley -rrb- . went here for a friend 's birthday . the <unk> : if you go home hungry , its your fault . they 'll do their best to fill you up on
3 came here for restaurant week as the reviews for this place seemed pretty stellar . first things first , outstanding service -lrb- almost <unk> so -rrb- . our server gary took great pains to ensure the four of us had a good experience and were taken care of . props
3 a longtime valley institution , i 've been going to mary coyle 's ice cream for over a decade and its exactly the same then as is it is today . located on 7th ave. in north central phoenix , this small ice cream spot brings in people from all
3 i feel like this place gets an unfair wrap in part because its constantly compared with matt 's big breakfast . yes , matt 's is better . but no the gap is n't that wide . i took a group of 4 of us to breakfast here this morning
3 really awesome little neighborhood candy and dessert shop . variety of treats available including rice krispy treats , ice creams , pies , and hard candies . i got the s'mores sundae . holy moly was it good -lrb- and huge -rrb- . it was about $ 6 but worth
2 food was okay . did n't really care for the texture of the meatballs and the bread was rock hard . that said the appetizers and desserts were good . supposedly the pancakes are where its at so i may try those next time . a little bit pricey for
4 i was lucky enough to get tickets for the john <unk> <unk> concert here not long ago . it was my first visit to symphony hall since it <unk> an extensive multi million dollar renovation years ago . it was also my first time seeing the phoenix symphony in action
3 another ddd try , we had to come here twice . the first time it was just to crowded . glad we came back . i really enjoyed the daily special , which changes every day . also enjoyed the waffles . wife and daughter enjoyed the usual eggs and
3 had a opportunity to bring a few of the family here last weekend ! my baby big brother had the big unit and with help from all of us , i thought with the size this dog would have problems ! just because it 's big ! does n't mean
3 i have had the opportunity to watch games at the staples center , and honda center in los angeles and anaheim . both are great arenas and are very fan friendly . jobing.com is totally different , and that 's not a bad thing ! i really enjoy the arena
3 not going to try and act like a food critic here ! if you are looking to try this place , then you already know about seasons 52 . wife , daughter , and myself came here on a saturday for our wedding anniversary ! i had their chili ,
3 this place is amazing ! since i was kicked out of my house ! -lrb- my 20 yr old daughter wanted to have a romantic dinner with her boyfriend ! -rrb- i took the wife out ! i have heard about ipic , but never looked into it ! so
2 on a whim i showed up last saturday night without reservations and waited 45 minutes for a table outside on the patio . well worth the wait to enjoy al fresco dining on a beautiful patio . i thought the menu items overall were a tad pricey . so i
2 i dined at the arrogant butcher last night while a suns game was in progress . the place was packed on a saturday night and you could definitely feel the <unk> and energy throughout the restaurant . i was with a group of about 10 people and we had a
2 i 'm taking my rating down from 5 to 3 stars because k o'donnell 's food has been inconsistent the last couple of times i have been there . i was really disappointed with the <unk> pizza this past weekend . it looked to me that the cook forgot to
4 i love the olive garden . although it cost $ <unk> -lrb- before tip -rrb- for a party of three on my recent visit on <unk> . if you really believe those awesome breadsticks are free , think again . i recommend the <unk> chicken con broccoli and the minestrone
4 anybody that does n't give this place 5 stars has to have their head <unk> . we brought some out of town visitors to the <unk> railroad park the other night and had a blast . i think we spent $ 14 for the whole evening for 4 adults and
3 costco has something for everybody . i try to go here in the evenings after 7pm since this place is a zoo during the day . i had to break that rule when i decided that i was mad as hell and i was n't going to go to my
3 i enjoyed my maiden voyage to first watch this past sunday . my wife and i were here early before 9am so there were n't the crowds that i have read about in past reviews . i had `` the traditional '' which consists of two eggs scrambled with 4
4 awesome breakfast place as well . yesterday i had the western omlette which comes with country potatoes and an english muffin for $ 6.50 . there was so much delicious filling food that i skipped lunch yesterday . kudos habanero 's !
3 i have been to jason 's deli several times . i want to rave about their bowl of red beans & rice spiked with chunks of sausage for $ <unk> that fills me up . and do n't forget the free all you can eat garlic bread slices . this
3 my wife and i enjoyed the 12 inch sausage and grilled vegetable pizza -lrb- grilled vegetables is definitely out of my comfort zone -rrb- . the pizza tasted great , we spent $ 18 on this medium pizza , a little bit pricy in my opinion . they do have
1 went there for lunch today and spent $ <unk> for the buffet and a soda . the salad with the fresh vegetables was good and the clam chowder soup was ok . the pasta was n't the greatest and i did n't care too much for the bread or pizza
3 if you ca n't cook and need a good home cooked meal then head over to beaver 's choice . the average tab per person for dinner is about $ 15 . the 20-30 minute wait for the food was not a big deal . it gives you a chance
2 okay , movies are only $ 3 ... $ 2 on tuesday . popcorn and soda are reasonably priced . seats are pretty comfortable . wish they would a -rrb- put in <unk> in their lobby to <unk> the lines up and b -rrb- do the same for the snack
2 from may 20 , 2010 -- or those of you who love the mediocre food and service of caffe boa ahwatukee -lrb- no relation -rrb- , do n't go to the tempe big sister . tempe 's caffe boa , headed by chef payton curry , is sleek , friendly
3 picazzo 's has undergone a name change and new menu , but <unk> things are the same ... they 're just touting their organic and local qualities . their `` puttanesca '' pizza -lrb- artichokes , olives , feta , tomato -rrb- is outstanding , though has nothing to do
4 wonderful place . the interior is charming and the <unk> she is was friendly and inviting . seared kale , green beans , beets & sweet potato salad with basil goat cheese is out of this world . for vegans the goat cheese can be switched out for hummus .
3 my sister passed along a free movie pass so the hubby and i went yesterday . this place is really nice ! i 'm not much of a drinker , but the bar was impressive . we were the first of 6 people to arrive for the afternoon showing of
3 i really like switch . the crowd was a nice mix of people which is something i look for in a restaurant . we each started with a side caesar salad which had an abundance of cheese , it was the best caesar i 've ever had . i ordered
4 i 've been twice ... so far and enjoyed my meal each time . the burrata is outstanding . the pizza is to die for . the 3 berry cobbler is killer . the music is memorable -lrb- <unk> , run <unk> , <unk> boys -rrb- . ca n't wait
1 i do n't know if this restaurant is mexican , puerto rican or cuban , but i do n't get it . we split the monster quesadilla which has jack cheese , monterey cheese some tomato and jalapeno peppers . i went with the sweet corn tamale as my entree
2 the prices are unbeatable . the menu is extensive . my husband loves beef so this was the perfect place for him . unfortunately , this restaurant is not vegetarian or <unk> friendly so i will not be returning for myself , but i will pick up take out for
2 good , but the salad was not as good as remembered . still think its a great spot in <unk> !
3 we never go to breakfast , but glad we did . happen to be in the area and great place . good portions , good value . had the breakfast chorizo and was really really good . if it was a bit closer to home would definitely go back .
4 this is our spot ! sit at the bar , get good company , good drinks and a great happy hour .
2 food , really great . service , good . atmosphere ... great looking place , but not a really fun atmosphere . been here twice , friday happy hour and a wednesday dinner . friday at the bar was mildly busy , good bartenders . wednesday was dead , but
3 the food is very yummy . the coffee to die for . the place moves at its own pace ... which for some in this `` i want it now '' world may be slow . so go there with someone you want to talk to , take your time
3 we went for dinner . the staff is excellent . very attentive , prompt and super ! we split their burger and fries . delicious ! also , love the decor and ambience . but if you sit outside avoid sitting at a table where the waiting benches back up
3 two additional visits : one for happy hour . go the cheese appetizer plate ... bit pricey $ 18 for a <unk> plate . north has a better plate for $ 10 happy hour . also , the waitresses blood went cold the second she realized we were there for
3 been there twice . once for a yummy brunch . for $ 10 <unk> you get a choice of delicious meal and a beer or mimosa . service was very friendly and timely . i got the eggs on muffins with bacon and salsa ... very tasty . also went
4 one of my favorite hotels in phoenix . i worked there for a year and have stayed there a few times as well . love the boutique feel , the colors , the furniture , the great atmosphere , the art , the pool , the rooftop ... i have
1 went with a group of friends on saturday night . yes , there was a huge book of songs . it was my first time singing karaoke ... which means i needed a lot of drinks in me . they kept the martinis coming , but i ca n't tell
2 oh 5 & diner . we used to live in the neighborhood so we ate here a lot . not so much now , it was just really convenient . they do have great shakes and i always loved my biscuit with honey on the weekend mornings . i also
2 i bought a pair of <unk> from here once . i love those <unk> by <unk> <unk> . also the crafty burritos hang out here on the third saturday of each month and they have some amazing handmade items for sale .
3 excellent ! sometimes a little noisy . sometimes a wait . i pretty much always get a lettuce wrap cheeseburger , their bread is too big and sweet potato fries ! i love how the fries come out in little shopping carts . it was the first restaurant i had
0 disgusting . i would never eat here again . gary and i went to mill on sunday . we wanted to go to the bookstore and to try someplace new . when we walked in , he said , let 's go , i do n't want to eat here
2 outrageously large portions , good enough to share with the whole family . the baked beans are also fantastic as a side as well as the slaw . i 'm not a huge fan of the bbq sauces , but the meat is just right : -rrb-
3 delicious popsicles ! yumm ! while i 'm not used to paying so much for a fruit bar -lrb- since they come pretty cheap at the grocery store -rrb- the flavors here are amazing and fresh ! i was introduced to this shop by a friend who recently began working
4 marble rum cake is to die for . so is the tiramisu cake . recently they started selling macarons as well , for under $ 1 each , which makes a nice snack when you 're craving some french cookies : -rrb-
3 i went for happy hour and was pleased with the food and service . i agree with some of the past reviews that the food is nothing special . the guac was good , but i prefer the guac at the mission . there is something special about it made
4 the experience started out a little slow but quickly turned into a great time . we had the mushroom taco , pork taco and fish taco . the mushroom taco should only be ordered if you are vegetarian . the pork taco was outstanding . i do n't typically order
1 stay away . rude people . they changed the game i was watching and no apology . they were rude . i went down the street to the firehouse and was treated as a customer should be . to the tavern <unk> - customers have a choice . train your
3 i really like this place . great vibe and i am smitten with the hibiscus margaritas . we went around 7pm on a saturday . nice crowd but it was <unk> up a few hours later . server was knowledgeable about tequilas and was friendly and fun . loved the
3 we had a nice evening here . it feels like a `` cozy date '' restaurant and all was delish . came via a yelp search and was pleased at the results . first of all the margaritas are really really good . they make their own sweet and sour
3 we always go non chain and love this local joint . the fish tacos , shrimp quesadillas and burros are our favorites . lulu 's caters also . it <unk> ' t cheap but it is really good .
3 we really like this venue . it is small so there is no bad seat in the house . we had a general admission for a concert and are so glad we did n't get seats . they were crammed together in front . the lawn is <unk> to you
3 we came here based on good yelp reviews . delicious fresh and great . i am not a big breakfast fan so for me to be psyched is unusual . the restaurant is darling with exposed brick and <unk> <unk> . they moved down a block last year to accommodate
3 love crepe bar ! so excited that this place recently opened in my old tempe stomping grounds - if only it had existed while i attended high school nearby : -rrb- crepe bar offers both savory and sweet crepes and both aspects of the menu are enticing . on the
2 we checked out sushi roku at the w for a fun night out with friends and sushi . the restaurant was surprisingly quiet with an almost empty dining room . the dining room itself is serene and lovely and we were seated in a comfy <unk> <unk> table perfect for
1 this place just was not very good . my in-laws suggested it as they 'd been there before , we were in the area and needed to get dinner . it was initially quite promising , as it is in a cute little building that is decorated in a quaint
3 the restaurant is very nice on the inside compared to the outside . i nice place for a date . i ordered the tom <unk> gai and it was very flavorful , not quite as rich with coconut milk as at thai rama , but still very good . i
3 i would probably give it a 4.5 . the sticky buns are all they 're cracked up to be !! delicious . i ordered the filet and it was delicious and like butter . i ordered it medium rare , i know it 's not how ladies usually order it
4 i do n't think i can live without thai rama ! as i said in my earlier review , the # 18 soup is amazingly delicious ! the # 23 garlic chicken is probably my favorite dish ! i 've been ordering a different curry every time i go .
3 oh biancos . this is n't really a restaurant you can just say `` hey , lets go get a quick bite to eat '' . this is a commitment of time . there are other pizza places in phoenix , with perfectly good food . biancos though , it
3 the food was impressive . the fox concept restaurants never seem to disappointment and north proved that again . for starters we had the zucchini chips , which were the most addictive things i 've had in a long time . i really wish i had a continuous filling bowl
3 the atmosphere is moody and dark , which i 'm a huge fan of . there were comfy couches , and beautiful chandeliers hanging from the ceiling . the appetizers were fantastic . i had the tuna tartar , chicken wings , and the scallops . towards 11pm the bar
3 i really wish i lived in downtown phx so i could make maizie 's a regular brunch spot . the $ 15 mimosa buckets are way too tempting ... actually , it 's probably better i do n't live near by . we went on a saturday morning while on
4 beautiful people , tasty brushetta , good wine all go well with the good weather . no complaints , but this place could you an early acoustic jazz happy hour a little more regularly . great place in the sun !
3 love this place . the food is good too , but this dining is all about this setting . deep in the walnut orchard under shady trees . sitting across from the one in your life . it is 4 stars just because the service is getting a little weak
4 finally a raw food cafe that is n't in tempe . love their drinks and raw food menu . just wish their prices would come down bit . this is the type of place i could eat at everyday . i know it is good because the afternoon lull does
4 my couple friends from india spoke badly of this place . however , upon reflection , i ca n't think of a time where any indian friends , have ever given a favorable review of any indian restaurants . i ate here and loved it . i got the dosa
4 best martinis in the entire valley ! maybe even the world ! yes they are $ 13 each , but you ca n't drink more than two without stumbling out of this place . my favorite drinks are : - side car -lrb- sweet and tastes <unk> , but wow
3 i love the food , but its just pizza they are over charging and trying to make the place way too swanky . i have been to italy every <unk> chef can make delicious pizzas like these there . they difference is they do n't <unk> you or pretend its
3 love this place for me it beats chuck box , in n out , smash burger , five guys , about the only place it ca n't touch is <unk> . the onion rings are <unk> . i 'm not a big fry person but the wife likes the sweet
0 your kidding right ? i guess this place is cool if your drunk , but they local soup kitchen has a better menu .
1 good drinks , , an ok service . but i have had better steak at a fast food joint . an for <unk> crazy prices <unk> you should be ashamed don an charlie !! 70 <unk> for two sub par steaks and salads ... no thanks .
3 after reading all the reviews i had to check it out . unfortunately , i think i 'm going to have to go again . not that it 's bad that i 'm going again mind you , it 's just that i did n't really get to see it
3 i love every sandwich i 've had here - except the philly . how weird is that ? it 's my friend 's favorite sandwich , but to me it 's just missing a little something . on the other hand , the pork is amazing . add the <unk>
3 cost plus has grown with me . as a teen , it was a place to pick up something small here and there -lrb- cards , lamp , frames -rrb- , and dream about what `` my house '' would look like . in the early 20 's , i
4 after hearing someone say `` phoenix has a zoo ? ... really ? well it ca n't be that good if i have n't heard of it . '' i knew i had to write a review . -lrb- and yes , i did actually hold back from running over
4 we went to the farm to check out the farmer 's market and go to lunch . it was amazing . i ca n't believe this is only 15 minutes from my cookie cutter stucco house . it 's almost hard to believe it 's even in phoenix - though
2 did i miss the door where they do the `` extreme <unk> '' on the way in the door ? had i realized that my `` normal '' looks would have been so horribly out of place i swear i would have gone through that door . i even looked
3 i almost feel bad writing a review . i mean , yea , i 've been there several times . but my experience has been rather limited . it 's always happy <unk> time on the way home from work . since , as i 've mentioned in other reviews
3 dang , these other reviews make me wish i 'd eaten more ... this was one of our `` bitch about work '' spots so we pretty much just stuck to drinks , chips & salsa and maybe a quesadilla here and there . but still - i really like
2 lobster bisque . nuf said . soup and salad and i 'm good to go . or soup and burger or soup and whatever else i 'm going to get . pretty much we keep coming back to coach & willie 's for the lobster bisque . for food and
4 man , oh man . have i spent too much time here . beyond the standard trips for game play , we 've done several birthday parties including the pool table room , their dance club atlas and their fire & ice restaurant . i 've done corporate parties at
3 i have been to so many `` farmer 's markets '' that seemed to be selling more soap and candles than food , i 'd almost given up on the whole thing . until i found the downtown phoenix public market . wow . food is the main thing .
1 what is going on here ?!?! the last few times i have gone into lee lee they do n't have what i want . they never have clams anymore and they did n't have the shrimp i wanted or the live dungeness crabs . every time i come in here
4 love lee lee ! i get all of my seafood there beef is good too . the prices are great and the selection can not be beat . walking through the produce department is like traveling to an eastern country . i always find something new to buy and try
2 this was my first time here . we sat in the bar and caught the tail end of happy hour . apparently that have complementary <unk> <unk> , although i did not have any . we had a few cocktails and ordered some salmon and yellow tail sashimi and <unk>
4 this is my favorite place in downtown chandler for lunch . the atmosphere is clean and simple . i enjoy sitting by the huge front window watching the world go by . they have a tasting menu available for lunch for around $ 11.50 . it includes : spring rolls
4 i 'm in love ! i came here after purchasing a groupon ... we sat on the patio enjoying the great weather . our server was great and we quickly found out he was the owner/chef . they were offering two liquors that evening and one was a vodka filtered
3 this is a great breakfast or lunch standby in downtown chandler . <unk> is owned my the serrano 's family and carries some of the same menu items . i enjoy their lunch salads . get the 1/2 size and i promise you will leave full . the french fries
3 i stopped in for a few drinks and some food with a few friends . we sat in the bar . the female bartender was really unfriendly in the beginning but eventually warmed up . they have fresh squeezed juices and i love that !! i had a delicious greyhound
2 found this hidden place by accident . you order at the counter and they bring your food to the table . we started with shrimp and pork spring rolls . they were good and a large portion . when it comes to pho the choices are limited to basic chicken
4 all day happy hour on sunday ! i just moved within walking distance of north and i could not be happier . i have been a couple times now and love it ! their house wine is great and during hh even their reserve bottles of wine are half off
4 omg they have the best dolmades i have ever had . i 've searched high and low for them , including multiple greek restaurants and the <unk> . still no one can beat pj 's dolmades . i am also in love with the roasted bell pepper hummus . i
3 really hip hangout . i went at night though , and i imagine it would make a nice daytime chill place during summer . i met up with a friend who had a cabana rented , which was cool but it 's ideal for a small group ; pretty cool
3 the food is great , the prices are up there . it 's always freezing cold in the restaurant so if you 're not doing takeout bring your sweater . definitely get the side of mac and cheese , you wo n't be disappointed !!
3 as promised , here 's my `` make-up visit '' update . things improved dramatically since the last time i went . firstly , our server was n't an upsell machine . in fact , she was very polite and concerned about our order -lrb- mine was particularly attentive with
3 i 'm not a fan of what 's annoyingly referred to as `` tex-mex '' food , at all . it gives me the idea of <unk> like moe 's , or lame <unk> , run by people whose <unk> probably could n't pronounce `` cantina , '' that cater
3 this is a nice way to spend a day off . especially if , like me , you 're from a place that does n't have desert plant life and want to learn more about the mystical desert gyms like cacti , agave , et cetera . lots of scenery
4 - outstanding food . - fries are truly addicting ! - very inexpensive prices . - very clean . - questionable area . - plenty of parking .
0 -- service was slow ... no refills , never checked back , had to wait for check . -- pizza was pretty good . crispy toppings . -- parking was not too bad . park around the corner . -- too bad for the awful service here ! maybe they
2 i have to say that i usually like the culinary festival but this year was only so-so . we have been to the gap the last 2 years - for those that do n't know this goes on the last 2 days and you are able to eat and drink
0 this update does not <unk> to the service staff directly or even the overall food -lrb- as you can see from my previous review -rrb- . this update is solely based on the behavior of the owners . my girlfriend and i had a bad experience here over the summer
3 went here for lunch to get a cheesesteak and it was fantastic . lightly buttered , toasted , soft bun , and plenty of meat , onions , mushrooms , and green peppers on top . if you do n't want cheese wiz then you can get it with provolone
3 this is a cool spot . it does live up to its name in that the restaurant has a posh , bistro like ambience to it . you can get burgers like a la carte by getting them in 3oz , 6oz , or <unk> sizes , so it 's
4 i hike this almost every day . obviously , i love it . i take no breaks . <unk> , maybe . here 's what you need to know : parking can be tricky . if you 're going at peak times -lrb- get it ? -rrb- , the lot
2 have you ever had a <unk> drawn of you and a buddy ? did you worry that your enormous nose would be <unk> to eight times its normal yet already abundant size ? so while your female friend is cute , which you know the <unk> <unk> artist will <unk>
3 ok so here 's my deal with zipps on camelback . been there 1000 times . they have a great great veggie burger . like , super tasty . ca n't emphasize enough . but the last time i was there i had a really bad experience . my <unk>
4 pretty much no shopping experience makes me as happy as going to costco . their pizza is reason enough not to jump . big portions of life make me happy . i like the fact that it 's membership only . keeps the <unk> <unk> at bay . f-ing <unk>

4 <unk> , some of these reviewers make me embarrassed to be an avid <unk> . here 's a tip - if you are basing your eating out based on where you can get a steep discount , you probably are n't paying enough to deserve to be treated like royalty
3 we love the brunch here - they might have my favorite bloody mary in town , and the flatbreads and benedicts are delish . all-in-all , though , some of the dishes i 've had are just sorta ... meh . and not `` meh '' like `` meh ,
4 finally ! great vegan food in downtown phoenix . not that i 'm a vegan . but still . the owners here are really nice and will chat you up about your meal , especially if you order something vegetarian . the portions are smaller than most people will probably

3 i 'm not generally a big buffet person , but i can handle them from time to time for breakfast or brunch -lrb- not so much for lunch or dinner -rrb- , so when i was in town for thanksgiving i stopped in here with my dad , brother-in-law ,
3 if if was n't for a rude hostess i might bump this place up to 5 stars . that being said , this place still offers an awesome happy hour ! not only is there several , cheap , options but the sushi is actually good -lrb- let 's be

3 although i think on some level the atmosphere -lrb- how many jewish delis are there in the phoenix area ? -rrb- and <unk> proportions somewhat <unk> how good the food at chompie 's actually is , at the end of the day this is a solid restaurant with good food
2 i do n't really get this place . i used to go to mimi 's for breakfast every now & then -lrb- not just this one -rrb- and always found it to be solid . nothing spectacular , but a not notch above denny 's & ihop . and frankly
4 ummm ... so i have to bump this place up to 5 stars . i was here 3 times in a <unk> period last time i was in az -lrb- friday night , saturday afternoon , saturday night -rrb- . so yeah ...

3 <unk> is appealing , service is friendly & attentive . hawaiian punch is to die for ! i highly recommend the fish taco 's , very filling . the only negative is the hours , only open till 9 week days and 10 fri & sat .
3 i love that every time i walk in to a chipotle , no matter how many people are in line i still walk out within 5 mins . their veggie bowl with brown rice , fajita style onions with bell peppers , black beans -lrb- the refried beans have bacon
1 nothing too special about this place . just close to where we live .
3 absolutely loved this restaurant . your immediately greeted when you walk in , the service is friendly , the food is delicious and the price is just right . i ordered the pizza rustica , their version of the vegetarian . it tasted as good as it looked . the
1 the worst service ever . over priced , mediocre and bland sushi . not even worth the happy hour
4 wow . wow . wow . did i say wow , cuz wow . and i mean wow in the best possible way ! party of 7 came by on a friday night with no expectations , no reservations , and a 2 year old which can usually spell out

2 i use to love going to mimi 's on weekends for breakfast . maybe i should have stuck with that . went there on my lunch break around <unk> and was suprised that it wasnt entirely busy so i figured we would be in and out ... i was wrong
3 i had an amazing stay here ! the staff at check-in was amazing , the rooms were beautiful and the pool is awesome ! i wish they did n't stop service at the pool at 5pm during the summer or on the weekends . and , it would have been
3 i have not eaten at az 88 in years ! i was happy to find out that things had not changed since i had been there and that is a good thing ! my bf and i went there after an event and had a pretty amazing dinner . the

2 i would have to say that this place is as `` american '' as you can get when it comes to `` mexican '' food . the fajitas are ok and have a decent flavor to them . i wanted a little more than a pile of onions though ,
3 if you like simple , raising cane 's is the place to go . all they serve is chicken strips so do not come here if you are thinking you can get an alternative because you can not . i love the flavor of the chicken and i love the
1 i really was n't impressed with this place at all . after reading all the reviews i thought the burgers there would change my life but really my life was n't changed at all . they have a sign saying they were voted '' the best burgers in phoenix ''
2 this place was pretty surprising because i have driven by it numerous times but never had been inside . the inside is huge and looks like it can serve a lot of people , which explains why it looks so packed on weekend . the food is average but they
3 i 'm a fan ! plenty of rotating taps - they just did an arizona <unk> and have a lot of -lrb- random -rrb- arizona brews - and also bottles , all reasonably priced including their flights . this is a great place to watch a game or just catch

3 the only thing preventing me from giving jade bar 5 stars is the service . we arrived on a friday afternoon around 5:30 pm , and we were able to snag a high boy table near the window . this table was also right near the server 's station ,

4 very good . the place is beautiful and the food is delish . we got the special salad which was good . my wife got the bass which was out of the park good . i got the chicken and dumplings which was not my fav , more like chicken
4 this place beats bevmo 's ass all the way to the bank . they have it all - case closed . i have had several specialty items i have been looking for ... not only did they have it but the staff knew what it was i needed right away
4 love this place
3 i like crispy meat patties and butter atop around surrounding the burger . onions of the fried ring type i also like . i do n't like that did not have the fried cheese curds , so i like that i 'll have to swing on by this place again

3 minus one star for being the type of place where you 're always asking yourself `` ass or <unk> ? '' apparently , it can get way too crowded for its own good so you 'll be doing some serious rubbing as you navigate through the sea of yup .
3 it 's simple . i really wanted - scratch that - needed a pastrami sandwich on christmas . and thanks to some wonderful cultural differences , chompie 's was open . the rest is history .
4 five stars . the staff at the royal palms is so unbelievably helpful and courteous . i 'm not sure i 'm the type you might expect to find at a resort like this , but i 've never detected a whiff of attitude from anyone here . last year
4 i just watched the godfather here . i 've seen it maybe twenty times in my life , but this is the first time in a theater . dan harkins , i could kiss you .
3 this little place will surprise you . the burgers are awesome and the prices are reasonable . why ca n't we have more of this and less <unk> ?
3 never had a bad dish at babbo . the prices are fair and the staff is nice . it can get very busy at peak times . it is best to go on off nights or off hours to avoid the crowd .
3 the sub sandwich of burgers . seriously . i could only eat half and i can put it away . the patty is just so thick , i could n't handle it . i must really need to get laid if that last sentence about a thick hamburger sounded <unk>
3 recently scored two cruisers on craig 's list or <unk> or one of those internet sites i hardly use because i feel like i am going to get <unk> . now i can relive my childhood and ride bikes around scottsdale . only problem is i have n't actually been
4 it 's getting warm and that means it 's time to crash some pools . this was long overdue for an update . my family visited for spring break and probably spent almost every day at this pool . technically i was n't crashing , but nobody cares if you
2 it gets three stars for being next to lux -lrb- white and black chocolate mocha , mmm -rrb- . what a joke the hype is , seriously , 5 stars <unk> anything impresses you people - `` oh , it 's better than sandwiches in france '' and `` it
4 i really like sushi brokers . the service is not that great , but the creative rolls are fantastic . my favorite is the hawaiian -lrb- it has salmon and mango on top with some kind of sweet clear sauce -rrb- . it really is just another trendy scottsdale sushi
3 i like you carlsbad tavern , i really do . we are friends , right ? sooo , i can totally come back even though i was introduced to you while on a date with a guy who i 'm not dating anymore because he has a little problem called
2 if my best friend were writing this , sprinkles would get 5 stars . he <unk> his craving for cupcakes so often that they now give him free ones . seriously , he has a problem . just last friday before he met me for happy hour he called to
4 i 've been coming here for years and i just love valle luna . i am probably being generous with the stars , but over the years it has never let me down for a tasty mexican meal . it 's casual dining and the bar is pretty fun to
3 you know what ? i am really pissed . really pissed that none of this existed when i lived in north scottsdale . i had to run to apple because i got a tiny plastic ball stuck in the <unk> jack of my ipod and was desperately hoping they could
4 while it is true that touch of thai is nothing special to look at , the food more then makes up for it ! actually , i always get mine to-go . the panang and red curry are soooo good that i never get anything else . i 'm a
4 i 've been having dreams about the famous grilled chicken salad . it was so good , i wish i could go to the white chocolate grill every week and eat one . i keep thinking of ways to make that convenient for me , but in reality it 's
4 hands down , my favorite restaurant of all time . my grandparents have been going to avanti since the 70 's ! it does have a <unk> vibe and i think i have actually seen mob activity there before , but that is what makes it unique . the service
3 went to thai house again today and ordered the pad kee <unk> and <unk> king that prompted us to enthusiastically give thai house 5 stars . unfortunately we were disappointed . neither dishes were as <unk> and complex in flavor as the first time . we ordered beef with both
2 great service ! we had a sampler plate but did not try the green chile . after reading alex 's review , i 'll have to give the green chile a try before i can give sylvia 's another star . we <unk> a server down to tell her that
3 3 stars for the food with an additional star for originality , service and decor . we were a bit hesitant to try bombay spice after reading mr k 's review on their first location . it seems that the owners have taken mr k 's advice to heart and
2 we usually prefer the more hole in a wall kind of mexican , but got a coupon in the mail so decided to check blue adobe grille out . the servers were a bit overwhelmed by the lunch rush -lrb- it was later explained to me that one did not
3 4-stars for value . great place to fill up on cheap , tasty sandwiches before or after shopping at lee lee oriental supermarket . menu offers : - european sandwiches - asian sandwiches - gourmet coffee - smoothies , asian iced drinks and italian sodas - housemade ice cream we
2 having grown up in hong kong and having eaten dim sum in london , ny , la , sf and vancouver -lrb- actually <unk> -rrb- , i can confidently say i know my dim sum . good selection of <unk> dim sum when the carts actually come around and there
4 lee lee is like disneyland for foodie . whenever i 'm there , i discover some new interesting ingredients ... not just asian ones since they carry ingredients from all corners of the earth . my motto for lee lee is buy first , then look it up on the
2 why not more stars ? while barrio cafe does indeed serve up some tasty good mexican food ... i was expecting to be blown out of my mind , but that did n't happen . we started the meal off with a generous portion of guacamole ... fresh & chunky
3 a recent lunch at nee house changed my whole opinion of this restaurant . the crab and dried scallop fried rice was as good as the best fried rice i 've eaten while living in hong kong . the rice <unk> were perfectly al dente , not greasy , well-seasoned
4 our new local favorite ! they took our business from zoyo ... . we live in the neighborhood ... support !!!!
4 loved this bar , stopped in for the first time in march . outside and live music , heavy shots , and they have a cart on the patio that sells meat cups ... say no more .
3 guilty pleasure . but incredible . when ever my will is broke , i will come here . love the soda machine ... too many choices !!!
4 america 's has , by far , the best bean & cheese burritos in the valley . it 's huge , cheesy , messy , and is almost as good as my grandma used to make . today i scored an xl bean & cheese burrito , chips & salsa
2 china chili is one of those places you visit when you want something you know you 'll like and need to get in and out really quickly . i started working on central and indian school just around the time china chili closed prior to the lightrail construction , so
4 mojo yogurt is full of win . why ? 1 . you can sample all the flavors before deciding which one -lrb- s -rrb- you want . 2 . great flavors , including dairy - and sugar-free options . 3 . topping bar ! yeah , there 's the standard
1 awful . gross . disappointing . a co-worker and i were n't in the mood for subway , mcdonald 's , or einstein 's , so we decided to try chico 's tacos - a place i 'd driven by many times but had n't tried before . the items
3 awesome food and drinks . i have been here many times and i am always pleased . my favorite is the chopped salad .
2 very few healthy and vegetarian options . i ended up with the humus and vegetables , which were alright . the mojito was a super drink choice . the beer flight was a great way to try many different beers .
1 this place wants to be postino , but has worse wine and the food is subpar . we went on a saturday and out was so loud we could not have a conversation because our was too loud . we will not be going back , try postino if you
4 this is my `` go-to '' place for groceries when i actually want to cook something . chain supermarkets have such a limited variety of produce and ingredients . if you 're tired of paying for overpriced , <unk> , wax covered fruit , then leelee 's is the place
0 what the pho , man ?! the food is bland . it tastes like they cater to the elderly . the prices are high for the type of food you are getting . nobody should have to bay over $ 5.75 for any type of pho . i 've gone
3 my kids thoroughly enjoyed having dessert here . i am not too big on desserts , but the paletas they serve there tastes as natural as can be . . it 's a pretty healthy alternative to to other desserts . paletas betty has a great selection of flavors .
3 the staff here is always friendly . they 're always on the ball with the drink refills . you 'll get good food for inexpensive prices here . i 've eaten here and ordered off of the lunch menu and dinner menu . i really have n't had a bad
3 went back ... it was better then the first time ... but the service was not what it could be ... oh well , the food was good . need to work on the service they need to get wristbands or something . . never know who my waiter is
3 i am in love ... this place rocks ... i have been there twice in the last three days , and so far tried the mojo classic chocolate and the pomegranate and both were delicious ... so delicious that both times i got brain freeze from indulging them so fast
4 top notch . i went here with a friend , after a nice early evening of window shopping around the biltmore , looking at things that i would either never buy because they are hideous or just way over priced , but i must say the biltmore is so choice
2 i love you man !!! is the movie i went to see last night at this theater . so i go to this place because it is close to my house is really never that crowded , there are two reasons why this place does not get a <unk> rating
1 first time at frank & lupes in old town scottsdale , heard this place can make a mean margarita , but i did not see any being made tonight ... to say the least i was sort of stuck here , due to some <unk> of a cop ... but
3 being right up the street from our house , my fiance and i decided to give this place a shot one lazy night ... the food was pretty good , the service was nice -lrb- although we got take-out , so did n't experience the wait staff -rrb- . the
4 an appetizer , 2 huge dinners , and beer for 35 bucks . yes . lots to choose from on the menu . good service . we will be back .
4 i 'm going with five stars ev en with them serving pepsi . the white pizza is perfect as is the capri salad . <unk> taste home made food
1 i loved the baked ziti but the meatball was terrible . dry old . burned . no flavor . what <unk> me is why the menu says its one of their special items . clearly they do n't make them fresh
4 finally my streak ended . this place always treats you like family even when it 's busy . i do n't like chinese but when i have to have it this is the only place i like to go to . i love their sesame balls .
3 dear lola coffee . you 're like that <unk> one keeps going back to after the <unk> is long past . you know the kind , the kind that keeps coming back begging for `` another '' second chance , saying she 's sorry , saying she 'll change ,
3 we 've been waiting for bertha 's to <unk> for quite some time . i had eaten at their previous location a couple of times , but my wife had not . so we were really excited to hear they had opened during the week and were looking forward to
3 this place was great ! the service was good -lrb- we did hear another server complaining about her table right next to us , but whatever -rrb- . the menu was unique and offered several options ! the only thing was ... it was a bit pricey ... we did
4 the thing i love about this place is that its simple . sandwiches , salads , soups . breakfast and lunch . there menu is specific ... what comes on the meal and what health benefits -lrb- if any -rrb- . they do not serve soda . tea , lemonade
1 maybe i 've never owned a pickup truck or slept with my sister but i do n't get this place just the same . i might as well see stellar reviews for burger king or wendys . this place is fast food , processed , greasy , nothing special .
4 i have waited up to 15 minutes in the drive thru here for an iced coffee ... i gave this place 5 stars i have been late to work , threatening my career with a company i 've spent almost a decade with ... i gave this place 5 stars
3 this pizza is the only official <unk> napoletana pizza in arizona . although this could be a <unk> award it does n't mean it 's not delicious . this pizza is amazing , the ingredients are quality and the flavor of the sauce is what really puts it over the
1 a rare yelp disappointment ! just a touch about filiberto 's and that 's a very generous compliment . i ordered the two carne asada burrito combo with rice and beans . the rice was bland and room temperature as was the beans . my wife <unk> on something that
2 over easy has gotten too big for its <unk> ... they 've jumped the shark ! just visited the new location and came to the conclusion that this place thinks its too good for their own customers . the food is slightly above average , do n't get me wrong
3 sure the food is good , but out of my last 20 take out orders they got it right maybe once . the people making the food look so high you would think you were at cheba hut , but i just love that damn broccoli and wisconsin cheese soup
3 this was my <unk> first visit to p.f. chang 's and it was very satisfying . went for lunch on a friday and it was not very busy at all . i 'll get into the food in a bit , but first i have to applaud chang 's for
4 i popped into monkey pants for my first time not long ago . i guess the best way to describe the environment is <unk> tacky . it was christmas time so they had lights up , including the sexy leg lamp thingy from `` a christmas story '' , a
3 4 + stars and yet ... the first thing i have to point out is that i think it 's very aggravating when you point out a problem to a restaurant and they do n't care . take chipotle . i really like the place . sure , sometimes the
0 <unk> or <unk> ? i do n't know and i do n't care . dec 7th , i got home and considered my options . a stuffed pizza from oregano 's , god , that sounded so good . i called at <unk> pm and ordered the pizza . ``
3 i finally remembered to get the brisket plate this time . . and it was a little tough at first , but the bottom was nice and tender . missed a 5 star review by <unk> much . <unk> 'd on the sweet potato fries , <unk> , our server
0 waited 30 mins to find out the girl was skipping me on the waiting list . she said she was n't skipping me , that there were places for two people to sit , but not one . the last time i checked , one person is able to sit
4 i stop here everyday , when i can . the `` matador '' is the best coffee drink on the planet , it makes my coworker go in to this <unk> frenzy . like a mexican <unk> . the chocolate croissant is the best thing i have ever put in
0 $ 8 for a tiny sandwich with one egg , two greasy strips of bacon , and a stale muffin . they say it 's pricy because they get it local ? it has to have substance to be considered anything . so whack .
3 went here for the first time yesterday and it was great ! i love fried chicken and theirs is really great especially if you add on the louisiana hot sauce ... ummm ! shared a <unk> 's which consisted of 3 pieces of fried chicken , 2 waffles , grits
4 <unk> !!! i totally heart this place !!!! my friends and i came here for the very first time and ... it 's just ... so ... heavenly ! i just had to try a scoop of the pineapple sorbet and coconut sorbet . it was pleasant . after my
3 had a great time here last week with my daughters . it 's good to go soon after they get set-up -lrb- less stinky -rrb- . the rides were fun , the food awesome , and the games were the same old trickery - though now you pay for them
2 the interior is impressive and this might be great place to watch a game and grab a brew . however , the food quality is less than impressive . i will not come here again to dine . it is a waste of money for the bland <unk> generic style
4 in the evening the view from south mountain 's lookout is an amazing , surreal scene -- much better than that big ol' hole up north ... an endless , dreamy sea of lights that completely surrounds you ... i have been taking visitors here for almost <unk> , and
4 the fish market has been here awhile , and it is still going strong . for the price this is one of the finest seafood restaurants in the city . i adore their clam chowder -lrb- white -rrb- , and just about everything else on the menu . that have
3 other than an occasional excessive wait time the quality of product here is unmatched . defalco 's has the best grinders and cheese steaks around , plus they offer fine-dining quality pasta dishes to eat here or take with you . they also have a mini italian grocery with a
3 this is a wonderful little breakfast spot - a huge improvement after the last place that was here -lrb- le peep -rrb- . food is high quality and a good value , plus the staff are really on their toes . i thoroughly enjoyed my <unk> eggs benedict .
3 free car service to get you there and home safe ??? hell yea ! dukes is a divey , large sports bar with a million tvs , decent food , and cheap ass drinks . specials every night -lrb- $ 2 burgers on mondays -rrb- , karaoke on wednesday and
3 i liked their original little place on the other side of the shopping plaza just fine , but this is even better . great decor , amazing food and very reasonable pricing . put this one on your list .
4 this restaurant helped <unk> scottsdale 's reputation as a foodie city and cowboy ciao is still one of the most consistently excellent places that i 've had the pleasure of dining . the menu is sparse , and for good reason , every single dish is done to perfection .
2 decent dive bar for mesa -lrb- <unk> border off the 101 -rrb- . this is another place that depends on the quality of the band . the music is why most people are here , and you wo n't have much luck chatting after 8pm as the place gets loud
3 fantastic change of pace . i loved their swedish meatballs with mashed potatoes and their pork schnitzel is also amazing . all dinners come with a multitude of delicious sides . unfortunately , the atmosphere here is about as romantic as a <unk> -- luckily they are moving to a
3 i really enjoyed my first visit here . the burgers are <unk> ala burger king . no , this is not a gourmet burger , but a basic one done right . the decor is modern and trendy with big comfy booths . service is a little slow , but
3 great local dive bar which has been around for over 25 years now ... this place is really big with a massive , covered , <unk> outdoor smoking area . shuffleboard , pool , ping pong , and darts ... this place gets really busy , and much younger on
3 why is it that little run down places always serve the most amazing mexican food ? some obscure <unk> effect is at play i 'm sure ... anyway the chicken enchiladas were <unk> with perfectly cooked white chicken meat and served with a bold red sauce rather than the standard
2 this looks like a classy place to have dinner and a few cocktails with friends ... we headed here for drinks after dining at blanco . the place was less busy than i remember , making us <unk> a prime outdoor seating location possible ... the seven of us enjoyed
3 the shrimp tostada bites and the ny strip make this place a local favorite . they have a really happening happy hour too and are close to mega shopping opportunities .
4 grapevine has the best karaoke system in arizona and it runs every night after 5pm . they have another cute bar upstairs that 's covered but open-air and allows for smoking and conversation . they also have a huge upstairs patio for dining which tends to be very popular during
2 watching the suns <unk> and cleveland <unk> was a little sad . looked more like a sloppy college game to me . anyway , we enjoyed the nachos and the crowd . highlight of the night was getting caught in the rain waiting on a passing train to let us
3 first visit and while it was pretty slow on a sunday night , the place had a great vibe and potential . they only serve beer and wine but i think their decor and the film angle will serve them well . good luck filmbar !
3 again , for a chain this is an outstanding destination . i have never been let down here . always amazing food and excellent service , which is astonishing being that i live next door and have been here frequently . i have always loved houston 's best for lunch
4 locally owned for around twenty years this is a true neighborhood fixture . while it 's not going to win any <unk> awards the people and the food here are off the charts . i 'm talking about some really really good homemade food ! i loved this place from
3 this year we popped into the old town tavern on saturday to have a few brews before taking on the <unk> ... and it worked ... we were all having a great time by 5pm drinking and listening to `` boston joey '' belt out tunes on the patio -
3 i visit one of the yc 's locations almost every month . the process of picking your own ingredients and sauces , having them grilled for you , and the ultra fresh taste of food just cooked is unique . an amazing value at about $ 10 ! their hot
4 simply the best bar in all of scottsdale . sure , there are swanky nightclubs , hotel resorts , dives , and lounges - but this is a good ol' neighborhood pub with cheap drinks and live music every night . <unk> might be the most unpretentious bar in old
4 i remember these guys when it was may west over on mcclintock . anyway , i dropped in here the other day and it is absolutely old school perfection . every item i have ever ordered here has been above par and the servers go out of their way to
4 first of all i am not a huge sushi fan or even close to a connoisseur - however , on occasion the mood does strike . i really enjoyed this place , the atmosphere is nice yet casual , and the staff are really friendly . the sushi is fresh
3 i had a good experience , likely because of the great company ... anyway , evo is just north of indian school on <unk> blvd. . the atmosphere is modern with subdued lighting . i started with the scallops as an appetizer -lrb- decent -rrb- , then i tried the
4 as good as a hot dog gets ! this place has been around a long time , and for good reason . <unk> top-quality meats right from buffalo ny . must try the <unk> -lrb- with tons of toppings -rrb- and the savory onion rings . the brat and the
2 overall a solid value for lunch - the gyro 's here are well done and the hummus is fantastic . try the plain hummus with diced jalapeno 's on top - yum !!!
3 this is a new destination in old town . the atmosphere is hip and <unk> , yet remains relaxed and comfortable . we tried this on a saturday night around 9pm and were lucky to get one of the last booths available . once seated our waitress was a real
3 a great little <unk> in mid-town phoenix . very casual yet modern atmosphere . very busy on weekends . nice little smoking patio out front ... one pool table and one of the better stocked <unk> i have ever heard . interesting crowd !
3 an old school neighborhood sports bar with a huge <unk> patio . this is a very low key place to get some pub grub and a buzz while watching your favorite team . not being much of a sports fan , i still like it for it 's laid back
4 wow ! this is one of the best chinese food places in all of scottsdale . i have always loved flo 's -lrb- on frank lloyd wright -rrb- , but this might have <unk> it . the `` house special salad '' is freaking incredible , the shrimp spring rolls
2 overall decent place . i think networks greatest <unk> may be it 's location and the hours -lrb- open more then most hangouts downtown -rrb- . i have had several productive lunch meetings here and the food is decent . the nightlife is usually a little slow , and service
2 this place is old school to the point that the school needs to be <unk> ... i think the crowd here on certain nights might be great , but the place itself is just too rundown . we visited on a sunday night and were disappointed after all the positive
3 so this location has a chill patio surrounded by two indoor dining areas and a bar . very nice indeed . unfortunately they only have a few mixed drinks , beers , and wines - no full bar . oh , btw the food here is very very good !
3 finally made it up here on sunday -lrb- with a hangover -rrb- . we rolled in right when they open at 11am . got the <unk> cheeseburger with hatch chillies - it changed my life . the setting is really interesting too , you eat outside kind of like an
4 yup , this place is very good . friendly service ... check ! fair prices ... check ! amazing food ... check ! best lemonade i 've ever had ... check ! they are also very knowledgeable about their food ingredients , so if you have food allergies or prefer
4 six -lrb- 6 -rrb- different types of gluten-free beer . including 3 types of imported gluten-free belgian brews . ftw . -lsb- / end review -rsb- <unk> : i guess if i was n't gluten-free i would go 3 stars . their beer selection was pretty decent . they had
0 wait , a <unk> <unk> joint with hispanic sushi chefs ? lol , no thanks .
4 pretty much what everyone else said . excellent food , cheap prices , no-frills atmosphere . easily the best tacos i have had here in az , perhaps ca also . they use good ingredients , high quality meat , excellent corn tortillas . i did n't try to go
2 !! warning !! their wait staff will tell you -lrb- on multiple occasions -rrb- that their sauces are not made with wheat flour . unfortunately , this is only true some of the time . after breaking out in hives hours after eating here , i called and spoke to
3 pretty good chinese food ... nothing phenomenal , but good . good , tasty cantonese style chinese food . they offer good portions for a fair price . the price was a little higher than i am used to for dishes , but they tasted good and the portions were
2 it 's `` ok '' . i love spicy food , and like someone else said , some of their dishes seem spicy just to be spicy <unk> full flavor . their margaritas are too sweet , imo , but do pack a punch . i also think their food
4 the heard museum is truly awesome . it 's not huge , but they make the most of their space , including short films , longer presentations , and a huge display of <unk> in telling the cultural stories of southwestern native americans . importantly realizing that native american cultures
3 why did it take me so long to find this place ? it 's kind of tucked away on the side of a shopping mall with very little fanfare . if you peek in you may think its just a bar , and indeed , they have a great selection
3 a group of 18 , and as the lunch group staggered in <unk> , the 2 waitresses could not be nicer or accommodating -lrb- even up to splitting checks , wow -rrb- . i took the <unk> , most everyone really enjoyed the offerings from the $ 11.50 4 course
3 on a return trip , i purchased yet another designer purse ... this is getting to be an illness . more importantly i went thru the <unk> racks ... excellent to score a great bargain on clothes . i wrote too fast , up a star !
3 searching high and low for spanish ingredients , i would pick up an odd or end here and there ... and there is n't much in the valley , so i mostly ordered online ... but aj 's was the best one stop shop locally for imports from spain :
2 been twice now , owner and counter service very friendly . the food is ok when you have a need for chinese american food fix . deep fried items are really deep fried ... <unk> crunchy bits of chicken kind of thing .
4 armed with a new cookbook from cali 's wine country , i 'm excited to find duck legs and several lamb cuts -lrb- ground , shoulder , leg , etc -rrb- ... this store is just awesome for the variety they offer ...
3 i thought i was just the uncool kid not <unk> . . but i quickly scanned the reviews and did n't see anyone mention ... rock spring 's cafe <unk> n heat !!! every first sat of the month , it 's all you can eat bbq at their outdoor
3 i am excited about this place , even though i have not had many <unk> to try northern style chinese food . think dough , and do n't mistakenly believe it 's the same dough <unk> / stuffed in different ways . the kind owner lady proudly told me each
3 my coworker likes to eat here when we 're at the mall over lunch , and honestly , the place had to grow on me -lrb- seriously half a year -rrb- . i 've worked out my formula -- a half sandwich -lrb- winner : roast beef <unk> -rrb- and
2 this place has been on a <unk> of owners over the years . . if i 'm counting right , 3 owners in the past 6 years ... the worst was the pompous <unk> who `` renamed '' those on his staff w / limited english such as <unk> and
1 really nice counter service for our to-go order , got a <unk> <unk> of their menu . both spring and crispy rolls , a rice dish and a wonton pho soup . the rice dish was charbroiled pork plus shrimp which were pretty small and sort of dried out looking
2 finally got a chance to try this place today for lunch . tried the tom yum and tom kha soups - both are delicious although i prefer tom yum . spicy thai lettuce wraps were enjoyed by my wife . i had the yellow -lrb- chicken -rrb- curry . good
2 the gelato is great but they do n't have a very big selection . there 's another place a few miles up the road that i prefer but stop here on occassion because its closer .
1 i do not like saturdays here . the day definitely does matter when it comes to this place . the crowd is young , even the ` tenders ! like , under 25 young . <unk> , casual , retro , drunk , snobby , loud , rude , semi
1 i am so torn between 2 & 3 stars . this new `` vig '' just ... was n't . it just was n't the vig i 'm coming to know & love . we showed up around 12 or so on april first friday . parking is a disaster
3 thank you <unk> for not giving me a judgmental look because i 'd been out all night & came in still <unk> from st. patty 's . just , thank you . i 'm such a <unk> ... me : `` ummm can i get the veggie omelet , but
3 if the food was n't so darn expensive i 'd give 5 stars . so many beers , so little time ! we went on a tue & it was n't that crowded at all until the hockey game ended . we sat at the bar . food : -
3 good asian food , ca n't give a complete review because i am very <unk> and order the sweet and sour chicken every time , but that itself is great ! the pre-meal salad is also good , coming from someone who is not an avid salad eater . the
4 i discovered freddy 's a few months ago , and it has since worked it 's way into my lunch rotation since it is fairly close to where i work . the burgers are unique compared to the norm , if not a little greasy . the staff has always
2 the location of this place is pretty unfortunate -lrb- in the ghost town that is city north -rrb- . and i might be spoiled by other yogurt shops , but the variety seemed to be lacking . the saving grace would have to be the 1/2 price tuesday twitter word
3 i have n't tried to many items from here , but the chicken parm was good , i had some chicken dish for lunch one day that was n't the best . the bread was fresh from the oven so the butter melted as soon as you spread it ,
4 i 've driven by this place countless times , but never went in until a friend told me about the 99 cent beers and free pizza on friday nights -lrb- after 10:00 -rrb- . i was skeptical and was sure there was some sort of catch , but there really
2 i 've stopped in here a few times for lunch , especially when i 'm in the mood for some sweet potato fries . they are ok more often than not , though i am not a big fan of the olive oil addition . on my most recent trip
3 i like this place . food is pretty darn good , it 's simple & reasonably priced : -rrb-
1 i love coffee and try places all over . i really , really wanted to like this place . the coffee is average . the pastries are average but expensive for what you get -lrb- americano is $ 4 , muffin $ 3 -rrb- . the wi-fi is ok but
4 the desserts are excellent . nothing more to say .
4 z tejas has been and always will be one of my favorites here in the valley . first , the good is great quality and great value . you can get a great meal for $ 15 . i know people knock it because it 's a `` smaller ''
3 sky harbor has always been an easy airport to get in and out of . it 's pretty much a giant loop . and since the renovations and whatnot , it looks awesome . they 've even changed up the signage , making signs bigger and brighter . the layout
3 came here expecting the worse just based on the average reviews for this place on yelp . and i have to say , i was pleasantly surprised . the staff were super helpful in recommending alternate beers and they even give you samples to make sure you 'll like something
3 the place is awesome . love that its a dive ! it 's close to old town 's douche <unk> , but still far enough . the place is laid back with some awesome beers . there 's a pool table and the patio is heated during the colder months
3 i really like the boba here . they have an extensive menu , full of different boba flavors and different ways to get it . i like my taro and getting taro is usually my way to judge a boba place . the taro here was n't too sweet and
2 the place is pretty fun . love that there 's karaoke and goldfish racing ! i like that they expanded their patio area . have n't gone for their happy hour or anything . their drinks are <unk> . i remember thinking that my beer should 've been less since
3 love this place . and it 's so close to home ! i love their selections of beers ! i love that the servers there are so knowledgeable and helpful when it comes to trying to figure out what beer i want . thanks to all the random samples ,
4 i love ra sushi . this location and vibe is amazing . i love the waitresses and its always a great time going there . in the evenings and on weekends sometimes they have these amazing djs making your happy hour even happier ! i think their vegetable roll is
2 this is my local taco shop . i like their tostadas and bean + cheese + rice burritos . they are reasonably price , and quick . they have a drive thru which is a nice feature in a taco shop ! make sure to ask for sauces .
1 i 've been walking past big <unk> around 2pm to appointments in the area , and it always smells soo good . my boss , co worker and i were in the area for lunch and we stopped there on my endorsement . it was kind of a disappointment .
3 grab your hula skit and bring your <unk> attitude ! maui dog is an oasis of the <unk> combos that you rarely find anywhere other than the beautiful hawaiian <unk> . it 's small and fun and full of tasteful , effective <unk> decor . i tried the tiki dog
2 yelp rating : high ; expectations : high ; reality : so-so . i ordered what the server recommended -lrb- carne adovada -rrb- , but there just was n't a lot of flavor -lrb- a rare fluke ? -rrb- . i think i 'm going to have to go back
4 i do n't drink coffee , my tummy does n't like it ... well i should say it gets very angry when i drink even <unk> coffee drinks . the interior is trendy urban industrial , and there 's a huge fan to keep their covered outside area as cool
3 very pleasant hip restaurant . try as many bruchetta options as you can ; each order comes with 4 pieces -lrb- potentially 4 different toppings -rrb- , and all the ones i got were delicious : brie & apples with fig spread , tomato jam & fresh <unk> milk cheese
4 went here for az restaurant week ! amazingly , my fabulous foodie friend , jan -lrb- she looked stunning in her gorgeous black dress -rrb- setup our dinner there . omg , so many things i 've never tried before and absolutely loved ! legendary puffs , <unk> . check
3 great atmosphere and really yummy food . if you want drinks , go during happy hour ; for food go during dinner . in the dead of summer the flies are not a problem , mostly because the doors are closed .
4 save this place for a special occasion : anniversary , special birthday , <unk> date , valentine 's day ... and go all out ! posh does n't have a traditional menu ; in fact , they do n't have a menu at all . come prepared with a desire
3 good breakfast place ! went here with my parents this weekend for breakfast . i must say everything was great . we were seated promptly , order was taken in a timely manner , and food came out fast and delicious . i recommend getting the veggie egg white omelette
3 delux is the <unk> ! great service , diverse menu , tasty food , and kitchen that stays open till 2:00 am ! now that 's what i call competitive advantage . if you like burgers get the delux burger ! you ca n't go wrong . i am mostly
2 i 've been taking advantage of the holidays to try out the various places on mill ave in tempe . i work about 5 minutes away , and a friend suggest <unk> , so i decided to check it out . it is definitely a bar that sells food rather
2 i like smashburger burgers . they use good meat and ingredients - not at all like the typical fast food . they can get soggy pretty quick - which is n't necessarily a bad thing . they are on the pricey side . the burgers justify it . it 's
2 good , standard food . definitely a chain that 's consistent - i 've been to several around the country , and they 're all pretty much the same . i go for meetings , but only once in a while on my own . it 's a bit pricier
4 the wife and i were looking for something low-key and random to do on halloween so we gave this place a try . it was pretty early -lrb- 8ish -rrb- so the place was n't very busy at all . that was a good thing because this <unk> we could
2 i was not excited to dine here . i was soured on anything that chris bianco could come up with after the absolute pain in the ass it was to eat at pizzeria bianco . however , aside from the pain in the ass parking , them not taking reservations
3 i have been to this place twice so far . the first time i had no idea what to expect since i never heard of it before . i honestly have no idea what to compare it to but i guess the closest thing is texas road house judging by
4 my wife got me the best gift ever for my birthday - the master teppanyaki chef experience -lrb- <unk> -rrb- ! i love teppanyaki probably more than i should and definitely more than anyone in my family so i do n't get to go as often as i would like
3 went here a few nights ago with a party of 4 . we just missed the dinner rush and had the place all to ourselves . there are tons of reviews on here that pretty much cover everything , but here are some points to consider : * water is
0 my 1st . experience here was pretty good up until i looked at my online bank statement and saw that they charged me 3 times . i was expecting a charge for the tickets and another charge for our food , but there was a random $ <unk> charge <unk>
3 i went here for dinner on friday night . it was about 8 and the place was pretty dead which was odd yet nice . i guess this place does a fair amount of pickup orders so that is probably why the place had only 3 or 4 more people
2 i really ca n't give this place 4 of my stars yet . i 've been here about a dozen times over the years and it has always been ... well ... just ok . it is a pretty solid place that <unk> out a pretty good array of food
2 my wife and i went here for lunch today . the place was n't very crowded and the service was fast and friendly . the food came out pretty fast as well . we both ordered a 1/2 sandwich and 1/2 salad . the salad was pretty unique in that
4 ocean club , along with all the other restaurants in the mastro 's group , is as good as it gets . while pricey , the service , decor , food and selection are all top notch . i have eaten at all of the mastro 's restaurants several times
3 this is the exact same thing as thai basil down the street . however , thai elephant is more expensive , serves alcohol , and you can order just a cup of soup instead of an enormous bowl . but do n't get me wrong ... both thai basil and
3 my wife and i went here last night at about 6:30 ish . it was n't crowded at all . it is a great looking place and has a really cool vibe to it . the other reviews on here cover it pretty well . * grilled <unk> salad -
4 i went here for dinner with a large party on a sunday evening . we had a reservation so we did n't have to worry about a long wait but we did have to wait until our entire party arrived to be seated which i guess is pretty normal .
4 i would n't call this the best pizza ever , but it is very very good . i 've been hearing a bunch of buzz about this place so naturally i needed to give it a shot . i 'm not a big fan of the `` sweet '' sauce
3 i went here last night with a party of 6 and i ca n't believe i 've never yelped this place before . i 've been here several times over the years and pretty much everything to be said has been said on other 's yelp reviews , but here
2 my wife and i went here last night for dinner . the inside was packed so we took a seat on the patio . it took about 15 minutes to be acknowledged by the waitress who said there was some confusion over who was taking our section and that she
3 went there last night for a brewery tour and some sex and the city 2 thing . the tour was interesting and dieter was cool as always . after the tour my wife and i sat outside to have a beer and some dinner . i had the wedge salad
1 i do not understand why everyone and their mother is opening up trendy burger places . actually , i think i 'm going to open one up on scottsdale road and shea and charge about $ 15 for a dry and tasteless burger . oh wait , there already is
4 this place is excellent ! here is my run down : * hot goat cheese and wild mushroom arugula salad - i split this with my wife . while it was very good , i would n't recommend splitting it because it was n't that big . i 'm really
2 i love it when a unique new bar/restaurant opens within walking distance of my house so i was very excited to try this place . my wife and i finally made the walk last friday . we arrived just as happy hour was ending and the place was packed .
2 * 5 stars for uniqueness - this place has very interesting food and flavors that are n't common around here . * 5 stars for the staff - everybody was very fast and friendly . * 5 stars for coolness of the location and the establishment - i mean it
3 i 've been to this location a bajillion times . the food , service and decor is pretty much like all the other paradise 's in az but for some reason i like this location best . i went there yesterday afternoon for lunch and for some reason they did
4 my wife took me here on my birthday for breakfast and it was excellent . the weather was perfect which made sitting outside overlooking their grounds an absolute pleasure . our waitress was excellent and our food arrived quickly on the <unk> saturday morning . it looked like the place
3 when i want something asian this is my jam !
2 i 've only been here to check out the food at gallo blanco so i have n't had an opportunity to view the amenities or the quality of the rooms . everything outside seems to be under construction , the elevator does n't work so thankfully i 'm not staying
1 kona grill is a beautiful place but you definitely pay for the scenery in the cost of their meals . i ordered their chicken & broccoli stir-fry and when it came out i was unimpressed with the amount i got for $ 15 . there was about a cup of
4 i loved the place . the atmosphere was great . the staff is friendly . the pizza was great . it can get a little pricey when you order your own pizza and start adding things to it but its well worth it . i can also say that i
3 great food . love the atmosphere . <unk> a place to check out !! take a date !
3 good price . pretty good gyros . con ... they need to clean the tables down .
0 food was way overpriced for the taste . beans overcooked . tortillas seemed stale . server was horrible . avoid this place . dont waste ur $ . sorry bout <unk> .
0 i must say that i was amazed that i had purchased a groupon now to use for lunch this afternoon and they were not even open . it looks bland on the outside , i really could not see inside . i get the feeling that i may have been
3 i was here last sunday and must say that i was pleasantly surprised . i had passed this shopping center on thunderbird numerous times and wondered what the * & & ^ % was in there . now i know . the restaurant cuisine is modern american . what i
2 the other day i stopped into dillon 's on central avenue just off of the canal . i typically ride my bike by that location at least once a week , so this time i decided to stop by for lunch . the atmosphere was different than i had expected
4 the buffet is wonderful . a wide assortment of indian food at about $ 10.00 per person . the chicken dishes are simply terrific . they also provide bread on the table and a fountain drink for $ 1.00 . the decor is inviting and the staff are nice .
4 i finally found a bakery in town that has some of the same pastries , breads and cookies that i had growing up in michigan . i bought my son a smiley faced cookie and one with sprinkles . he enjoyed them quite a bit . i bought some chocolate
3 all of the food ordered at my table was very tasty . overall , a very reliable hardy italian food place .
1 went with a group for work . initially i could n't find it -lrb- it is actually in the mall -rrb- and then had to circle around to find parking to avoid the $ 6 valet . food was ok . i had the kimchi chicken -lrb- i do n't
3 great drinks , friendly staff . menu is very pork oriented -lrb- a major plus -rrb- . everyone at my table was very pleased with their main courses , but the bacon and cheese biscuits were dry . overall , great place and i will return .
2 i should start to lower my expectations when i try out new places . recently i 've been walking into over-hyped places only to get an average experience . its 4 pm on a wednesday afternoon , and the place barely has 1-2 families eating there . that 's ok
4 <unk> . so , driving by gelato 64 for years because it is right next to lee lee 's , i decided it would be in my best interests to try it out . if i did n't , my asian <unk> might have been taken away . there are
1 while i 'm not buying the whole yogurt fad , i will admit there are some pretty good yogurt places around town . yogurt is good when its done right , and when there are some ` exotic ' flavors to try . acai berry from yogurtland is absolutely one
2 good food . very simple menu . i tried the street tacos and the ` bombero burrito ' . street tacos were good , salsa selection is somewhat limited , but that 's ok , the tacos are good and the pricing is justified . the bombero burrito is also
4 i really enjoy going to dutch bros ! they always have friendly service and everyone is having fun ! i always get the kicker and its amazing ! tuesday 's are 2 stamp tuesday which are awesome ! i recommend going to dutch bros !

4 i found the service , food , and environment very fun and enjoyable . what a neat view to watch the maintenance people get the <unk> ready for tonight 's d-back game . a fun friday lunch with the girls .
4 such a fun evening and a nice treat . i love the comfy seats and attentive service .
4 did you know ... lucky strike has a weekday special where you can bowl a free game with your lunch purchase . what a cool way to spend an office day lunch hour . the service and food were excellent as well . i did not expect the food to
4 i had the mr. ruben and it was delicious and the 1,000 tasted homemade . wow , just wow !
3 i went for a baby shower and they served appetizers . everything was very good . the guac was nice and fresh with not too much onion . we also had good service that kept our iced teas filled .
4 this place is neat ! there is something for everyone . there are all kinds of cute clothes , <unk> , <unk> covers , shoes , baby clothes , dolls , and i could go on and on . the lady at the sales counter was also very welcoming and
2 neat store . i am a pc , but i did enjoy playing with all the toys . the store was pretty busy . i found it surprising that we were not greeted . i would go back for another look when the store is n't so busy .
2 this is one of the new stable of eateries on the 40th that is getting a lot of buzz . it 's right next door to the vig , and is always busy on weekends , which is the only time i can make it in . i really enjoyed
3 the best aspect of tcf is the ambiance . the interior of the restaurant is an <unk> theme -lrb- i do n't see the connection -rrb- and it is perfectly lit and <unk> for a dining experience . the food is so-so , with reasonable prices . the cuisine is
3 awesome location , both in <unk> border and also the tempe location ... 1st experience in about 2008 in tempe . . lil crowded for lunch , but well worth it went a few times , then in 2010 experience <unk> newly opened , great look and roomy even though
1 ok , tried sauce in chandler , n now this one ... unless you are into over spending for less food just because it may be a little healthier , then have at it . . the flavors have been bland , and leave out of there for about 12
3 cornish pasty is one of my favorite places for lunch when i have the extra time and even better when we are able to spring for a beer . there is something for everyone on the menu here . i have tried a variety of their pasty 's , but
3 one of my favorite places to frequent downtown ! the blue corn enchiladas are my favorite . the wait service here is always spot on and its great that they have added a patio to the place for extra seating . usually their steak and chimichurri sauce is spot on
4 wow ! how did i not know about this place before now ? coconut 's fish cafe is a <unk> eatery with surf board tables and benches . there is outdoor seating as well , but you order first from the counter and then they bring the food to your
2 good prices for happy hour . cool red and black decor inside . i appreciate the entree menu including listings f or <unk> or less . i think you just have to know what you 're ordering . my veggie delight was simple , yet tasty and healthy . my

3 i 'm always a little skeptical when i walk into a restaurant on a friday or saturday night and it 's almost empty . that 's never a good sign . however , mijana proved to be a great new place for tasty , ethnic food that has lots of
1 we went during the week and we were the only customers in the place . the service was <unk> 'll say that right off the bat . not that the staff had anything better to do , as we were their only customers , but the guy who turned out
3 finished a great hike today and did n't want to blow it on greasy food afterwards . pita jungle came to mind !! this place has such a great menu and even though i 'm always tempted to get my favorites i tried something new today . everything is always

3 i will always like four peaks for what makes arizona great ... drinking outside on a great patio . just awesome . that 's really why i come here . i have fond memories of this place and many happy hours . it 's also where i got to know
3 enjoyed new years ' eve here at the stone rose lounge . the event was mostly outside around their outdoor bar . although it was a very cold night , they did pretty well positioning all those heat lamps everywhere . the seating looked very pretty , but it was
3 while in the area we wanted something for lunch but knew we 'd be having dinner out that same evening . not wanting to fill up too much we ordered an appetizer and entree to share . the lettuce wraps with shrimp were so good ! fresh and crispy veggies

3 i discovered this place online when i did a search for good sunday happy hours . to my <unk> t they do n't really have a happy hour menu . $ 3 house wine , a few other drink specials , no food specials . that was about it .
4 i used to visit this farmers market weekly a few years ago , but at some point mcclendon farms pulled out and it just was n't the same . now they are back and it 's more awesome than ever !! mcclendon farms has the best produce and their organics
3 this bar is an old renovated house in the heart of the artsy `` first fridays '' area ... and what a cool place it is . their beer menu is very , very impressive , but they do n't <unk> . they also have some wines by the <unk>
4 woohoo chinese food ! found out about this place from neighbors . it 's close enough to walk from my new condo . great service . once you step inside you get the feeling that you are in san francisco for chinese dining . we loved the walnut fried prawns
4 durant 's is the bomb ! first visit to durant 's last night . i agree with other yelper 's . durant 's is bad ass ! do n't be fooled by the old building . the parking lot is behind and they have valet if you are into that
4 it was friday and we did n't feel like going out . pizza you say ? great , let 's either fly to chicago or get it delivered . been searching for good pizza since we moved to midtown . we decided to try something new ... pino 's came

2 i have eaten here several times and the sushi is always decent . not the best sushi ever , but definitely decent . it 's one of many valley sushi restaurants that are fine for getting a sushi fix , but not if you 're looking for a stellar sushi
3 definitely 2 thumbs up for the french toast ! it was absolutely delish ! my friend had the waffles and they showed up covered in whip cream and strawberries ! yum ! she said they were delish too ! this place is in a good location , with lots of

3 great place to go to for happy hour and cheap food/drinks . parking might be an issue if you go at their peak times . you might have to park your car at the nearby safeway lots and walk over . great service and delicious food/drinks , ca n't go
3 great location , right next to hilton resort on the sec of scottsdale rd. & lincoln dr. in scottsdale . this location is much smaller than the other locations , and the noise level was actually too loud for me as this is a very special celebration for me and
3 this place is crazy busy every time i went . if you do n't make a reservation and just show up expecting to be seated in more than an hour wait . always call ahead if you know what time you will be there or you 'll be waiting forever
1 had the pho tai there . service was n't bad , but the food was overpriced and medicore . you 're better off going somewhere else nearby like khai hoan or pho thanh .
4 tuesday night happy hour till 2am is what keeps bringing me back . $ 2 wells , small <unk> , and draft and bottled beer -lrb- including corona and blue moon -rrb- . the happy hour menu is pretty substantial , consisting of various sushi rolls , nigiri , and

4 santisi brother 's has awesome pizza and the best calzone i have ever had . i ca n't eat them anywhere else and i crave one about once a week . there are tons of tv 's covering the walls in the main dining room so if you love sports
2 i have to take a star off for the spotty service i received the last time i was here for lunch . i understand there was only one waiter at the time but the restaurant was not busy and we waited forever to get our food and we had to
3 i gave d'lish a second chance and the service was much better this time ! the guys who work here are funny , friendly , and make you feel welcome . i like that they use all natural ingredients in everything they make here and i think that 's why

1 i would give it 1 star , but thought that was a bit harsh , and i was n't there very long . the whole set up made me very anxious . the music is deafening and the acoustics and patrons talking make it a difficult place to relax .
0 i was on the hunt for a good croissant . croissants are one of those things i find tricky . most of them are terrible in these parts . i went to the bakery next to federal pizza owned by the <unk> hoping to find a good one . the

3 count me as a happy customer ! nice outdoor seating , good service , consistent food -lrb- after 3 visits -rrb- . nice little gem tucked away in the parking lot behind houstons .

0 this more so goes for all corporate movie theaters ... do the major film companies still question why people download movies ? how about the $ 7 minimum to get in ? way overpriced , extreme unhealthy food choices ? or sitting through 20-30 mins of ads ? $ 30-40
3 really good beer and beer selection . my favorite beers include their sunbru and the arizona peach . the seasonal <unk> is pretty intense and the pumpkin porter is amazing . their food is pretty good too . i am a fan of their soft pretzels , side salads ,
2 same menu as all the original -lrb- and only one true to my heart -rrb- . always start with the cilantro jalapeno hummus , add some sriracha and enjoy . i like their starters such as the fresh mozz and tomato dish , and on the cheap check out the
4 i chose this restaurant for my 50th birthday and it was well worth it ! we arrived about 15 minutes prior to our 5:30 reservation and were promptly seated . we were made aware that being we were celebrating my birthday , that we would be receiving a personalized menu
4 we took our two <unk> there for a much needed bath - being that it was too cold to bathe them outside . everyone did really well . great customer service and a really nice retail area . pretty much anything involved with grooming they have to offer whether you
1 one word for my late : water . not really sure what went wrong . on the other hand , right next to the gelato spot , which is worth something ...
1 i used to be a huge huge fan of this place . but , recently they seem to have quality control issues . one issue has been the bread -- which used to be nothing short of awesome . one a couple of recent visits -lrb- off the lunch time
4 wow . i have never been blown away by breakfast as i was here . never . simple . hearty . filling . good price . what more can i ask for ? i ordered -lrb- ca n't remember the name ... my bad -rrb- a croissant with eggs ,
4 i noticed the reviews here were mixed ... you either love it or hate it . i had passed this place long before guy ever showed up and was pretty impressed with their menu . i just never had the chance to eat here because i 'm either here in
2 what i remember most of the 3 times i 've been here is that it 's cold . like the ac blasts constantly at 65 . i bring sweaters . yes , <unk> . sweaters . the food is <unk> . does n't that <unk> a health code violation ?
1 i used to think this was a solid 3 star place . but not anymore . i 've left the valley officially as of last week and was sad to go . before i left , i made it a goal to eat at my favorite places , with chompie
1 they have <unk> hot miso soup ! i know that because the last time i was here , our waitress poured half of my miso in my lap . with no apology . and no offers to comp the soup that probably has left my <unk> unable to function .
4 the pluses : - amazing happy hour . seriously . the flatbread for a whopping $ 6 is enough for me for 2 entire meals - wine pours are $ 1 an ounce -lrb- $ 6 or $ 9 glasses -rrb- during happy hour . <unk> ! - staff :
3 i 'm normally one to shy away from restaurants that appear -lrb- inside and out -rrb- as if they 're going to give me the worst case of e. <unk> / <unk> <unk> i 've ever had . but i just do n't care when it comes to carolinas !
4 damn , i miss this place ! i used to live at the <unk> 's apartments -lrb- big mistake -rrb- but on the plus side , i was less than half a block walk from this place . when i moved to scottsdale and had to actually drive to the
4 the awesome catering manager i was talking about is still there ... and still awesome ! catering orders $ 50 + they will deliver for a $ 10 fee . ask for a catering menu and they 'll include a 10 % off coupon for orders $ 100 + .
3 decent enough place . i 'm not a big fan of the old town scottsdale scene and this is one place i could go without <unk> on the <unk> . food is nothing special but certainly better than typical <unk> . great patio ! to melissa h below , what
2 super fresh food but the line is too long for a <unk> restaurant and ordering my food was kinda a hassle because the menu is like over your head ; it 's hard to see . it 's like they tried to copy chipotle but offer better quality food .
4 best bar in tempe .
4 great restaurant concept ! the food was super healthy and very yummy ... i 'm coming back soon .
3 this place is half market and half restaurant . the restaurant is very casual and had a great lunch <unk> for a small restaurant ; the buffet which was $ 7.99 . the flavors and spices were really good , i 'll be back . .
2 you get the feeling you 're in chipotle when you walk-in the first time , you stand in line order your food then pray you find a seat . i ordered the large <unk> and their smashfries which came to $ <unk> with tax -lrb- not great but not too
4 burger was fantastic , great service , great atmosphere , check it out .
3 this place gets slammed at lunch and i do n't think the restaurant does that well of managing the rush . i have been here a few times and you typically need to wait longer than usual for your food . the food quality is good and the service is
1 it gets two stars instead of one because the burgers were actually decent . other than that , it 's your usual <unk> sports bar and the bar staff has the worst attitude + ca n't pour a decent draft beer . i could understand the guinness i ordered but
3 i like cheeseburgers - i really do . i 'm not all that picky when it comes to them but i can appreciate a good one and lucky boy has good cheeseburgers . i usually get the ranch burger with cheese and bacon - it 's a good size ,
3 had family friends come in town and they wanted good mexican food and good fajitas . <unk> had both - the bean dip and salsa they bring to the table were excellent . the service was great and our entrees were wonderful . will be returning again soon !
3 i 'm not sure why i have n't written a review for jobot yet - i 'm there at least once a week and it has become my go to coffee shop . their toddy is the best i 've had in phoenix - it 's well made and a
4 i seriously love middle eastern bakery . i usually get take out but every time i 've eaten in the service has been great - the owners take time to answer question about the food and you can tell they care about their customers . i usually get the vegetarian
4 to keep it simple : la bocca is sexy , posh , upbeat , fun . the staff is always super down to earth , respectful , and attentive . i love the energy of this place . . the food ? phenomenal . fresh ingredients . . delicious wine
4 this place is heaven . i love the self serve bar ... and mixing in various flavors to make one heavenly delicious dessert . who could ask for anymore toppings ? there are dozens of combinations possible . oh , i love me some mojo and feeling like a 12
3 my favorite dish is the bone-in ribeye for 2 . it 's a special that you have to ask for and it 's usually available . the fleming 's potatoes are delicious , and the lava cake dessert is a great ending to a great meal . the wine selection
3 french toast with carmelized bananas , pecans and carmel sauce is delicious ! we went on july 4th and we waited for 20-30 minutes . not sure if that 's normal , but the service was friendly and fast .
3 went to this place due to the yelp reviews and also because it is owned by the same owners as metropolis , a new wine bar cafe in scottsdale . the food was inventive , which i really liked . we had lettuce wraps with ground lamb , roasted red
3 sat at the bar where they cook the food and that is the best seat in the house . they have a pretty good happy hour , all of the food and certain glasses of wine are 50 % off - good deal . food : the happy hour menu
4 love this place . cocktails are fantastic , innovative and great bartenders . the food is incredible . i finally tried the chopped salad -lrb- famous and on facebook -rrb- . the salad has smoked salmon , israeli cous cous , arugula , tomatoes , sun dried <unk> , pistachios
2 this place is always packed so had to try it . had the breakfast tacos with turkey sausage . very flavorful and good salsa . my bf had eggs benedict . although the eggs were cooked perfectly , the hollandaise sauce tasted greasy , rather than buttery , lemony .
4 even though the temps are over 100 for what seems to be like 9 months a year these days , i always make time for the soup here . tea light is only like 10 minutes from the office , and it is one of my favorites . i 've
3 let 's get this out of the way first , i 'm not a big fan of `` fancy '' steakhouses . i tend to think they are stuff , too old fashioned & boring . that said , this place proved to be an incredible night out & meal
1 it 's not that i do n't like this place , it 's just that it 's very run of the mill . bison witches does the standard sports bar <unk> college drinking hole thing . that 's all that can really be said about this place . you ca

3 alright - the first rating would have been an ` a-ok ' but they got an extra star for the eye candy bartender -lrb- s -rrb- . lol . the bartenders were quick and on their game and it was nice not having to wait forever and a day for
4 <unk> / <unk> : a folded pastry case filled with seasoned meat and vegetables aka amazingness ! yes , amazingness is a word . a friend and i had decided to check this place out , and absolutely fell in love . i ordered the spicy asiago chicken pasty :
4 cheap , quick , and freakin awesome ! oh did i add that they have free access to their vacuums . it 's the worst when you pop your quarters in and you have just a lil more to go and bam - it <unk> off . definitely do n't
3 i pass this spot daily and finally had the opt to stop in and grab myself an iced coffee . there is a sign on the front of the cash register with a woman talking on her <unk> and says `` we will not serve you while you are on

3 looking for your not so typical bar - big bang is definitely a good option . let me <unk> you tho , if you do n't do well in crowded places , this is not for you . friday & saturday nights especially make for an overcrowded venue and wait
0 the short story : the management is unfriendly and <unk> if their staff makes mistakes . <unk> , the lead bartender , trains the bartenders to intentionally pour the draft beer with extra head so as to give customers less beer -lrb- i 've heard this is because of a
0 this place annoys me so bad ... it has potential to be a decent place , if it werent for a few major problems . first , they charge a cover like every single night ... -lrb- and as someone else said in a review , im pretty sure the
3 a very nice , modern ball park . ive been here for ball games , and ive never had a bad seat . the diamond club -lrb- i think thats what its called ! -rrb- is a cool place to hang out if you need more distraction than just a
3 an extensive menu and a <unk> bakery give this place lots to offer . clean atmosphere , tvs , friendly staff . a solid choice for any time of the day .
3 great atmosphere and patio with bring your dog encouraged and get a treat from your server . i had a great deal with their happy hour pitchers for six bucks . the pizza and pulled pork were both good
4 cool bar , bike friendly , good draught selection ! told the bartender i drink everything and that he should pick me a good beer , the result was a great suggestion that i enjoyed thoroughly . this building 's layout is kinda odd with a loft and a couple
3 i liked the food and had a good meal . the decor and the seating arrangements were a little off though and i never really felt comfortable . its tucked away in a strip mall so i guess its one of those place you have to know to find and
3 took a while for the food but it did taste very good ! luckily i wasnt in a rush so the delay for the grub was not a big deal .
3 this place was great . i 've been passing it going to and from work daily and finally on a friday afternoon , my coworkers and i stopped by . there 's no self parking , there 's only valet -lrb- <unk> cash -rrb- . we sat on the patio
3 i keep hearing about this place and finally on a thursday afternoon , my coworkers and i made the trek downtown . we got there around 11:30 am so it only took us a wait time of 15 minutes to get a table -lrb- i heard the wait is usually
2 my co-workers and i came to eat here last friday . one of them really wanted sushi and i 've been wanting to try this place , so we thought we give it a try . we all got sushi , i got a little bit ahead of myself and
1 up until today , i had n't been here in years . went today at 10:00 am and was quite surprised at how busy the restaurant was . i was even more surprised at the prices . there was n't much on the menu for under $ 10 - for
3 we 've always had a great experience at this burger joint . the staff is friendly and helpful . the burgers are some of the best around - i think that most of the people who are complaining about greasy burgers are <unk> the <unk> of the burger with grease
4 i use to always go here . always always always . . i only stopped because i moved downtown . super strong drinks . super cheap . super random crowd , only thing in common is , professional <unk> .
4 <unk> <unk> , sunshine or <unk> sun roll . for hot stuff , firecracker -lrb- chicken -rrb- or <unk> <unk> -lrb- beef -rrb- are both delish . & always a gin press or two or three ...

2 matts was closed . -lrb- monday ... * <unk> -rrb- we went here . super cheap . good quality breakfast . i will return .
2 had dinner on saturday night . cool retro decor . we split a wedge salad and the grilled cheese . both were very good . my gf ordered the beef stroganoff and i ordered the pork chop . she liked her entree and i liked the pork chop until i
4 great drinks ! blue cheese balsamic burger is tasty . so is the lamb kisra . lettuce wraps are good . sunday brunch menu is great . cool modern decor . great service . always a place to ck out if yr downtown : -rrb-
2 i came here to have a meeting and i could n't believe how difficult it was too find . it sure would be nice to have a sign that faces the street , but that 's probably too `` commercial '' for this place . the tiny parking lot was
2 i came to bandera for a double date , and overall we had a pretty pleasant experience . i booked a reservation for 6:00 on a saturday night . when we arrived we had to wait 20 minutes before we were seated , even though we had a reservation .
2 my fiance and i tried out this place the other night by placing a to-go order . we both liked the food and were impressed with the spiciness of the dishes . the meat was lean and the wide noodles were amazing , but i thought the veggies lacked freshness
3 i freakin love this place . the food is so darn delicious . i only have a couple complaints about the place , but the pros far out weigh the cons . the hallway like establishment is a little too cramped for my style , so i usually call in
2 we randomly stumbled into pattie 's one night after having dinner in oldtown scottsdale and had a pretty good time . this place is definitely a dumpy dive bar ; kinda reminds me of a dirtier dos gringos . i liked the layout of the bar , partly inside ,
2 stopped by deluxe last night . it 's got that fun , it 's - <unk> 're - <unk> ambience for people who want to feel like they 're going out when they eat . the tables were all lit up blue , the furniture is very modern and the
4 i have been going to the pita house since i was in high school . the food is insanely delish , they have the best hummus and falafel in town .
2 the chefs at benihana are always amazing . the food was all kinds of delicious , but the customer service was lacking . we had made reservations for two tables , and when our party was seated we were taken to one table with 11 chairs with some chairs placed
4 i would n't change anything about casey 's -- i love it all : the open air , the door guys , the servers , even the bartender who takes out his love for michael jackson on patrons every sunday night . -lrb- also , there 's a special place
3 great location . usually amazing shows . however i do n't usually come down here unless there is someone or a band specifically i enjoy playing here . great local bands are always here though and the art is always enjoyable .
4 this is one of the very few downtown hot spots that are classy , helpful , kind , patient and fun places to be . this is such a great restaurant because they give you gourmet dishes and high class style for moderate prices . the staff is so amazing
4 everything about this restaurant is on point . from food selection to seating and atmosphere . i go here frequently and service is outstanding .
4 i have never had an unpleasant experience here . ive sat in multiple areas of the restaurant ... the upstairs being my favorite . i love the dim lighting and contrast in <unk> architecture . incredible seasonal food . wonderful service . i once stayed pass closing time without realizing
3 this bar is pretty fun and more laid back than some others in the valley . it 's a little hard to find , tucked behind some restaurants in park central mall . all in all it 's a little small , but it 's cozy . they have a
4 the thai food here is relatively americanized , but hey , it tastes great regardless . the portions are large and they offer a wide variety of dishes . one unique feature to wild thaiger is that in addition to being a thai restaurant , it 's a thai bar
4 the valley 's light rail caused a lot of <unk> when it was voted into effect -lrb- by a <unk> -rrb- , while it was being constructed -lrb- with a movement to stop the light rail , even while streets were torn up to install it -rrb- and now that
3 probably one of the best malls in the phoenix area . fairly new -lrb- 2001 maybe ? -rrb- and clean . good selection of shops with a large selection of restaurants surrounding the mall . theater is nice as well .
2 if you prefer locally-owned over starbucks , then come here . but do n't expect a whole lot of seating in this small coffee shop .
2 pretty fun place to go to . when it is busy there seems to be 1-2 beer pong tables going ... and maybe a game of flip cup . it is normally a open table for anyone who wants to play -lrb- or maybe i am just pushy that way
3 i like coming here in the morning and having a breakfast burrito and then going outside and sitting in the morning sun . it is nice too , if you happen to prefer a coffee or tea instead of a juice with your breakfast burrito then you can go next
3 cool place . wear whatever you want . sit with whoever you want . chat , have fun ... and quit worrying about life . ca n't wait to take a date here for the <unk> dinner . : -rrb-
3 i have a few places that i like to take out of town guests and guedo 's is on that list . i 'll be brief . pros : - good food . - generally fast for making on the fly cons : - cash only -lrb- *** update :

3 this place is always crowded on the weekends it seems . i 've never been here when it is not busy . it is fun and it has options . want to chill ? well , hang out on the patio . want to dance ? well , there is

4 best patio in town . order the sangria pitcher and take a load off . i wo n't bore you with a long review other than recommending those two items . recap ... step one , get a table on the patio . step two , order the sangria pitcher
3 hate the prices and the line . love the cupcakes and the look on my wife 's face when she is eating one . take your girl if in the area . you will get major brownie points for <unk> on cupcakes . highly recommend the carrot cake and chocolate
3 first i have to say that i 've only been once and only had appetizers -lrb- several as i was with a group on business -rrb- . we had cocktails , pizzas , and several of their cheese and meat trays . i was n't excited to go as i
4 st. francis is one of my favorite restaurants in phoenix for the following reasons : - it is trendy and chic with a cool indoor/outdoor bar and an upper <unk> seating level - it is neither in a strip mall nor is it part of a fancy , sprawling resort
4 if you want authentic , delicious mediterranean food , head to eden 's grill ! i 've been a handful of times and have tried quite a few menu items - the appetizers are all spot on and the entrees are huge portions . some of my favorites are :
2 had the chicken salad croissant , it was actually very good . the place was cramped and service was confusing . just an average place , but a decent backup if you cant get a table at the crepe bar next door .
4 best chicago style food in phx valley . i 'm from chicago myself and can tell you this place would be a top chicago food joint . the owner is from chicago and gets his beef fresh locally -lrb- portillos ships frozen beef from chi -rrb- . the <unk> is
2 three doors down from just relax . after a soothing 45 minute foot massage i carried the asian theme to noodles ranch . cool interior with blue walls , upside down red umbrellas and old photographs of vietnam . since this was my first visit i opted for the $

3 parking can be difficult at lunch time but worth the extra effort . wide choice of salads , sandwiches and homemade specialty breads . the sonoma salad with mangos , goat cheese and <unk> dressing makes an excellent selection along with a generous freshly toasted blt on thick whole grain
3 drove by this place so many times and decided to give it a try . did n't care so much for the waiting in line gig . perhaps it 's so busy and the place is small they have to resort to that , not a huge deal . had
1 this event is pretty chaotic if you 're a newbie at this . even veterans of this were a bit confused . i guess they switched to tickets instead of using cards for the <unk> season . would probably have used a punch card instead cuz keeping track of these
2 went to luci 's recently with the wife for a mid-week breakfast . i had thought that the food was going to be just <unk> . but was pleasantly surprised to see they offered ` hot ' food . we both ordered <unk> sandwiches , mine had turkey included with
3 the wife and i went here on a recent date night before meeting some friends in scottsdale for some bowling . we arrived around 5:30 and were able to be seating on the patio quickly -lrb- luckily it was n't too hot yet -rrb- . our server was with us
2 we went here for dinner on opening night . this culver 's there were a ton of employees working , and we were greeted by a couple at the front door . there were also several working the register , though it seemed to take longer than it should before
2 we went here for an early dinner on a recent friday night . i had been to the original location many years ago , whilst the wife had never gone before . only a couple of tables were taken , but as we were there the place got a decent
2 more like 3.5 stars ... we went here one mid-week morning about a week ago . i had read the reviews and looked at the menu online and thought this place would be right up my alley . first thought when we drove down high street ? plenty of good
3 the ambiance is just ok but the people watching and entertainment factor on my night out made it ok to round up . i did n't try the food . out on a rather impromptu night out we stopped in here after 10pm on easter eve . anna m. had
2 i remember this place from it 's more grand days , when malls were the `` in '' thing . living in the <unk> of rural northern az at the time , my trips to the valley would often include a visit here -lrb- mostly due to its proximity to
3 my friend tina t. invited me to join her for a wine and henna event that they host thursday nights during the summer . for $ 10 you get your 1st glass of wine and a henna design . while here we also sampled from their happy hour menu .
3 we found this place completely by chance on a rainy sunday . situated in a strip of shops on 16th street just south of thomas , the neighborhood itself can make some want to put <unk> to the metal and <unk> straight through . but i am kind of the
3 -lsb- solid 3 stars for food and 4 ... dare i say 5 stars for ambiance -rsb- sooo <unk> on my reviews ... i have been here a few times . mostly to drink but i have been here to eat too . they have over 60 beers on tap

4 as good as it gets in the valley . has to be the best and freshest sushi i have had here . three of us went in after 9pm on a friday night . the best part about rolling in late was the reverse happy hour . nice list of
2 i guess i was expecting more . while i dig the clean open vibe and the location , the menu left me wanting more . i was hoping for more wheat , soy and dairy free options ... on this trip i sat at the bar and decided on the
2 i am glad i tried this place . i had heard rumors and stopped in here with a coworker who loves it here . i enjoyed the samples they provide and ordering is a little tricky for the first timer but they are ready and willing to help you out
3 i sit here <unk> between 3 and 4 stars ... it is solidly a 3.5 . this was my second time here during their relatively new brunch service . first time i stopped in and enjoyed a cocktail -lrb- mai tai -rrb- , which was superb , very well mixed
3 a craving hit me ... one i love but do n't indulge in often ... egg salad sandwich . i am probably one of very few people who will order it when i see it on a menu . having only been to the downtown deli once before , i
2 -lsb- solid 3.5 stars -rsb- not having tried this place yet , as i was running errands on my lunch hour i decided to stop in . so i have this thing ... one that <unk> me to order egg salad whenever i see it on a menu . here
4 locally raised beef , pork , lamb and chicken ?! yes please . they have great weekly specials and any option you go with here is <unk> ! do n't blink or you will miss their main shop or you can pick up a selection of items at the phoenix
3 i kept hearing about this place from some good friends of mine . they would frequently mention their visits and their food and the friendly personal service from guedo himself . well i finally got to try this place out for myself . <unk> our way in from the parking
3 <unk> my mom was in town and as my birthday drew near she asked where i would like to go to dinner . i had 2 area restaurants i had not tried on my list and centurion was one of them . we <unk> up and walked over . the
4 usually i stop in here for my veggies and other grocery items that i forgot or could n't get at the saturday market . i had yet to stay and try any of their deli or food that they prepare on site . do n't ask me why it 's
3 what 's not to love about <unk> ? if they do n't have it you probably do n't need it ... heck they may even order it for you . i have been on a lambic kick and to my surprise i found many varieties to consider . their prices
3 4 stars for service and my beer <unk> .5 for food ... i have come to love yard house for their beer selection and variety . i mostly have come to love many of their beer blends . i had an old favorite there which was a <unk> peach cider
3 a neon <unk> with `` munchies '' <unk> within it <unk> you into an open door of half of an old house in a quaint neighborhood . very simple interior , with not many if any real place to sit and eat . but that changes regularly . they obviously

4 what else can i say that has n't been said already ? i 'm weirdly glad that they 're not closer -lrb- in fact very far away from me -rrb- because i 'll be there every day = <unk> tons of weight ! my baby loved the mango lassi flavor
3 we first ate at roy 's at their kauai location . i 'm glad to say that their food is as good in the desert as in the middle of the ocean . service is always good , food for the most part has been delicious , save a couple
3 i 've been to both locations , and i wonder if is fair to rate them together or should i do it separate ? the phoenix location is way to small for me , i do n't like feeling like i 'm almost sitting on my fellow diners lap and
2 make sure you 're <unk> when coming to this mall . this mall is where all the wan na be <unk> hang out that do n't feel like driving to az mills . unfortunately this used to be a nice mall a few years ago , but now , ghetto
3 furniture is actually not bad , but is clearly ikea . meaning you 'll know when you see it in other people 's houses . lots of cheap <unk> type things too . i came this last time to <unk> the free parts bin for an extra bed frame i
3 first time at this location , and it stands up with the rest the of the double d 's . sandwich was well made , delicious , and i wanted another after i was done .
3 really good hidden find in downtown phoenix . great cocktails and food . the music and atmosphere is something you would see in san francisco . such a great surprise .
4 i ca n't say enough good things about windsor ! if i lived up the street i would be a regular twice a day . i decided to show up for brunch this time . they have the coolest bloody mary bar with all the accompaniments from , fresh grated
2 i really wish salt lounge well . i assume this a happenin ' place late hours , but somehow i do n't think so . the concept for the three restaurant and bars near the movie theater is brilliant , even though i do n't think they are from the
4 best darn mediterranean food i 've had in a long time . my favorite is the chicken kabob 's and also a fatoosh salad . i mix the salad with the rice and chicken and the combination is so amazing . i make a similar salad at home , it
2 i love aj 's for a great coffee and ice tea selections and this one has the best selections . the store reminds me of <unk> farms back home because of the over the top prices . i would rather grocery shop at whole foods and get just as good
4 well fox concepts has done it again ! i went for my second time with my husband for lunch . i had <unk> soup , minestrone soup with italian sausage and he had the cheeseburger . the cheeseburger was the best i ever had , it topped <unk> 's cheeseburger
4 this place is dangerous ! the food and service was the best i 've had since i moved here to phoenix 4 years ago . i ca n't wait to go back ! we had the fries with gruyere cheese served with a side of mushroom gravy . the fries
3 judge it for what it is , right ? it 's a trader joe 's , and as tjs go , this is middle of the road . not the nicest location not the worst . not the best parking , not the worst , not the cleanest store ,
4 yup . that good . it 's all kind of a <unk> , but i remember being pretty exhausted , and totally famished . someone in the group got on the phone and called ahead to tottie 's to make sure food was waiting for us when we arrived .
2 very interesting ... its good but not wonderful . its perfect for your in a rush sushi craving ... basically this place is subway but with sushi . you can build your own rolls or pick from one of their signature rolls . i always make my own -lrb- adds
2 so i have been in to this place several times and i would normally say they are worth giving five stars but my last visit was n't so great . there beer selection is one of the best ! you can create your own six pack and even by growlers
4 i 'm in <unk> . in love so much i have a problem . no but really i think this place has <unk> my shopping addiction . 250 $ shoes for 18 $ yes please !! seriously i 've found jimmy <unk> for 18 $ . 1000 $ handbags for
2 just had a quick bite to eat here . thought their platters were half off after 5 on tuesday . not so ! anyway went with the short rib tacos with pineapple and habanero . good not great . husbands carne asada was perfect and divine . pretty busy there
4 such a <unk> gem . a must ! if you live close by want a casual cool bar .
3 great quick service and fresh salads !
1 yuck ! this place has gone downhill . i ordered a salad with roasted chicken and asked for red onion ... he said they did n't have any ?! your a burger bar , really ? my salad 's chicken was soooo dried out . embarrassing ! french fries horrible
3 i really like this place . i have been numerous <unk> of times and i keep wanting more . the friendly bartenders , the exciting chef -lrb- eddie -rrb- . the best part of this place besides the good food and comfort level is their all night happy hour .
2 i went to taco <unk> last night and started off with a house margarita for half price during happy hour . -lrb- $ 4 -rrb- it was very fresh and tart you could tell they didnt use sweet and sour , which is a good thing . i ordered 2
1 i was really looking forward to eating here because i had read good reviews . maybe we went on a bad day . they were very slow but it took way too long to get our food and they screwed up my friends order . i got a chicken ,
3 this is a great place to bring friends and family who are visiting from out of town . the food is just your basic tgif and not really worth writing about . most of the time i 'll just grab a tall beer -lrb- usually kiltlifter -rrb- and walk out
4 i was in town on business and so i did the solo dinner out at barrio cafe . usually solo dinners go by quickly for me , since i 'm usually just hungry , ready to go back to my hotel room after a long day on the road ,
2 when in phoenix on one of my many business trips there , i recently asked several people about where i could find `` the best '' mexican food in the city . as a native of san diego , i was longing for some good , no-frills mexican food like

1 i hate to have to give durant 's such a low score but this is the second time that i have experienced crappy service and mediocre food . this used to be my favorite restaurant when i moved here 6 years ago . i would rave about this place and
0 uh ... how is it that this place has so many good reviews ?! i love me a good burger and there are a few places in town that serve yummy burgers , delux being one . in <unk> we should have gone there instead but we , my beau
2 this place was pretty decent , but i would n't include it in my list of favorite barbecue joints . i ordered the pulled pork sandwich and mac and cheese , both recommended by the server . the sandwich was <unk> , which gave me a chance to try the
1 i really do n't get what all the fuss is about . there was really nothing special , nothing even average about the place . the burger had no flavor to it - just tasted like ordinary ground beef with seasoned salt . the fries were n't all that great
4 the bbq pastrami has taken its place among my favorite sandwiches . plenty of breads to choose from - i got the kaiser roll on my most recent visit , but i 've had several different kinds before , always great . i 'm not sure what makes this sandwich
3 seems like a great little breakfast hangout . i tried the <unk> -lrb- pork , bell peppers , onions , tomatoes , and eggs -rrb- . this was a good breakfast - everything was tasty and seemed like good quality ingredients . i 've heard good things about their pancakes
3 this was a pretty nice place to stop for lunch . nice environment , friendly and attentive service , and pretty good food . it 's a small menu , but there are a few things that look to be worth trying . this time i went with a french
2 i 'm not a fish fan , but the group i was with was , so as long as there 's some <unk> on the menu , i 'm fine with it . it 's a nice place , and the service was friendly and attentive . the cocktail napkins
3 we go here whenever we go to pho van a couple doors down , and ca n't resist having a little gelato no matter how full we are after dinner . they have a zillion -lrb- seriously , no fewer than a zillion -rrb- flavors to choose from including dairy
3 got ta love postino . great service , great ambiance , great selection of wines , & great bruschetta . in my best tony the tiger voice ... `` they ` <unk> <unk> ! ''
4 kept hearing good things about the happy hour here so we finally stopped in . and wow , ca n't believe it took us so long to check it out - it 's now one of my new fave places . the happy hour is incredible ! for $ 3
2 we ordered take-out from joe 's for monday night football . i called in the order and actually had to call back twice to make changes , and the girls taking the order were super nice and patient . with a 20 minute -lrb- or so -rrb- drive home ,
3 hubby and i love this place . good service , great food , ok prices -lrb- hence the 4 stars -rrb- . have had the fondue appetizer twice here and it 's awesome . get it on happy hour ! dinner entree i had was a chicken dish with mashed
4 omg . i ca n't stop thinking about my meal here . went for brunch on a saturday morning about 10am . got a table for 4 right away . server was quick to greet us and brought our drinks just as quickly . i ordered the huevos rancheros -lrb-
3 went here for a friend 's birthday on a saturday night . got there about 9:30 p and it was pretty empty . sat at the bar and although the bartender was pretty quick to serve us , she was n't the friendliest bartender i 've ever encountered and there
1 did n't care for it . expensive , small portions , and mediocre cooking . go a few blocks west to saigon pho if you want the real thing . but this place is <unk> , whatever that 's worth to you .
4 this is a very good and busy buffet . food tastes quite fresh and quite good . big selection and some good stuff - more when the price goes up , nights and weekends , but good all the time . sushi - which i 'm usually afraid to try
1 21/2 rounded down to 2 -lrb- elsewhere i 'd give it a 3 , but there is too much good competition around here -rrb- i came here because my favorite , hue gourmet , was closed today , wednesday . i 'm not a big fan of this place ,
1 duck with curry and pineapple , medium spiciness ... but i thought that it was very <unk> spiced ... but everyone else seems to like it ... so maybe it 's just me .
4 my fave sports bar . amazing food , great service . <unk> shells on the floor ... must have menu items are the jess jess wings , pretzel sticks and edamame ... but honestly everything i 've had there is good . for the vegetarians , try this ... patty
3 ahhh ... what can i say about phoenix sky harbor airport . i 'm no airport expert but i travel enough to know what i like and do n't like . so sky harbor is clean , there 's continuous improvements and upgrades and people are pretty friendly . getting
3 i used to go to yc 's all the time but this place has been replacing it . i am not sure why ... maybe the $ 1 sake during happy hour ? anyway , today there was a special for $ 6.99 bowls so my friends and i went
3 here is the breakdown ... cheap authentic chinese food . be sure to order off the chinese menu and not the american menu . one menu contains sweet and sour <unk> . that 's the menu for all the americans that have never really know what the difference between chinese
2 there are some good dishes here . pricey but good . the atmosphere is nice too like a little intimate tea house or something . i feel that for the amount of food for the money , it 's not worth it . they do serve some food that no
1 we tried this out last night . we wo n't be back . there is no indication when you walk in that it 's a <unk> restaurant . we stood like idiots at the hostess area until <unk> asked us if we needed something . we sat ourselves , and
2 ok . i 've given local breeze a few tries now . last time was for brunch . husband and i both ordered egg-white omelettes , the healthful aspect of which was completely <unk> by the gallon of oil that our plates were swimming in . every time i eat
2 this place gets 3 stars because there were some 5-star aspects and some 1-star aspects . 1-star : * too pricey * no <unk> nosh * our appetizers were plain and boring . we got the <unk> -lrb- one little corn tortilla stuffed with plain shredded chicken and smothered in
4 well , anyplace that gives me reason to <unk> food into my face until i feel like i 'm going to explode is worthy of 5 stars . brisket : nice mix of <unk> . ribs : <unk> . smoked chicken : moist , meaty , rich . fried okra
2 i 've been to the place on shea a few times and have always been impressed by the food and service . i just moved to central phoenix and was excited to find <unk> right down the road . same good food , different crappy service . i ordered for
2 three stars instead of four because i have a fundamental problem with restaurants that serve lunch food at dinner time . it 's the main reason i have n't yet been to carly 's bistro or postino . i want something hot to eat with a knife and fork ,

4 came here again last night for an order to go . we called on the phone but , you can also do your order on line . our order was ready as promised when were arrived . they are open till 9:30 even on a sunday which is great !
3 this is a really nice little place located in downtown phoenix . parking is quite good in their private lot , but if it is full you can always park on the street around the neighborhood . it is a house that has been changed to a lovely little eatery
4 for my 200th review i am choosing brio tuscan grille . first let me say that it is a beautiful building , looks just like a villa in italy to me . the colors are just what they should be . inside is beautifully decorated , and wonderful music is

2 i have to say this is not my favorite location . i find the one in chandler much better . staff is far more attentive in chandler location , as well as more knowledgable about the food they carry . the food even seems better there . we had always
2 well this place has been here for as long as i can remember . at least 20 years . they used to be wonderful ! one of the best places to go . but , they sold and changed staff but , kept the name . i do not know

3 lets just say that i go here for lunch at least twice a week . as does the rest of my office . it is that good . not just because its a hop skip and a jump from my building , but every sub i have ever had here
3 i ca n't understand why so many people give this place terrible reviews . its a sports bar for <unk> , what do you expect ? i do n't care what anyone else says , this place makes the cut for any sports fan in need of a venue with
1 there is nothing i hate more than a snobby waitress who is inattentive in an empty restaurant . there is no reason for this . i 've been a waitress before , i know how it works . . you make around $ 3 an hour which means your living
2 minus the 20 page menu and bad reputation for being overpriced and not that good , i kinda like this place . so shoot me . i came to this location for a drink , so i ca n't say anything about their food , but doug , the bartender
4 holy delicious cupcake batman ! okay , i have n't actually been to their location , but today , my new office neighbors were gracious enough to deliver 2 dozen of these scrumptious little treats to say hello . . well <unk> ! i 'm not sure i 've encountered
3 i have been to maize 's a handful of times , and have never been disappointed . however , those handful of times i was celebrating something or other and was drunk . . this past weekend , i actually went while i was coherent enough to legitimately critique and
3 any place with a <unk> <unk> as an owner and red sox memorabilia plastered on the walls automatically makes me a fan . the fact that their pizza is delicious makes me an even bigger fan . all these people who say the counter service is rude have obviously never
1 there is always a first - and this was my first experience with americanized vietnamese food . it did n't taste awful , it just was n't very authentic . we ordered a bun dish , a tilapia dish and a bowl of pho . i may possibly go back
3 mmmmm mmmmm mmmmm . omg . where do i start ? when i was little , we lived next door to an old italian couple . the wife would cook `` gravy '' every week and once in awhile she would invite us over to have some pasta and gravy
1 if i had to judge this place in less than 10 words , i would say - disappointing nobu <unk> that left my wallet empty . wow . what a huge disappointment . i came here for my birthday the other night . after my husband dropped over $ 400
4 this is a great place . the treats here are delicious and the sandwiches are yummy too ! the prices are right too . like i said , just a great place all around . they are even open late , convenient for just about any time . sometimes the
3 i just moved back to az from la and i 've been dying for some good pho . there are not many places here like there are in la and when i found this place i was super excited because it was nice , not dingy , and looked clean
4 simply awesome . the drinks are good and the boba is fantastic . boba tea house has a huge variety of flavors available - everything from the simple -lrb- mango , peach , thai tea , etc. -rrb- to the more exotic -lrb- taro , lychee , <unk> , red
4 lo-lo 's has some of the best food you can find in phoenix , and they honestly make the best southern food i 've ever had . their fried chicken is absolutely fantastic - it 's just so moist and flavorful . their mac 'n cheese is also excellent .
4 love the `` argentine po-boy '' sandwich , and the thyme shoestring fries are my favorite side . many mock meat alternatives which are quite tasty . i am a total omnivore , but love a good veggie meal . just two or three tables outside , but great to
1 i love sushi , but try to avoid the ra sushi restaurants . i was invited to meet friends for happy hour , so i thought i would see if anything has changed since i was here last . no . service was mediocre at best , the waiter was

3 great happy hour specials and a fun place to go with friends .
4 fave date spot . food is always great . love the wine and cheese selection .
4 decided to upgrade corbin 's on the strength of having happy hour 7 days a week ! <unk> ! had the tenderloin sliders and grilled ahi with horseradish aioli on the hh menu and they were amazing . cocktails were great . if you need me on sunday afternoon from

1 i 've always liked luke 's , it 's authentic italian beef ... how can you go wrong ! well , today was the exception . spent $ 25.00 for two beef sandwiches , with everything , two pepsi 's -lrb- medium -rrb- and a large order of fries .
3 i was craving for italian food the other day and what 's better version of italian than having a perfectly good spaghetti . this food has been my most favorite since my sis in law always took me to this place and order the linguine de mare -lrb- seafood spaghetti
4 so i 'm leaving on a jet <unk> . . do n't know when i 'll be back <unk> ... well i always get so excited everytime i go here . its just the whole feeling of going on a trip or just picking up business clients or family or
4 beautiful place to watch fireworks on 4th of july ! a truly romantic place as you can see the moon reflection on the lake and as you walk on the park , there 's a lot of colorful lighting that lights your way . this is my great escape place
2 it 's a japanese fast food . i 'm very impressed with the service , the owner spent some times to greet everyone . i ordered beef bowl teriyaki but the beef teriyaki is a lil bit over cooked and the smell of the burning beef just overwhelmed me .
3 this place was voted best brisket in the area so i popped up there with some friends and we tried a <unk> of different items . one thing that caught me off guard was the pulled squash sandwich , so i ordered it . the pulled spaghetti squash on a

4 cute little place with great teriyaki !! business owner is a very nice older lady , she <unk> walks around the tables to check if everything is well . the service is outstanding , teriyaki was delicious with rice and veggies . also if you get a large drink ,

4 oh red velvet how i love your silky and fluffy self !!! so delightful and tasty !! tammie coe 's cakes is one of my top favorite , from their ooey gooey cup cakes to my all-time favorite red velvet cake slice !! the cake is fully rich and splendid
3 ***** great breakfast spot on mill !! : -rrb- i had one of their hot sandwiches the focaccia <unk> , cut up grilled chicken breast pieces , tomato , gooey melted provolone cheese , light mayo on a cheesy focaccia bread with added minced jalapenos and lettuce to mine !!
3 this is a great place to go and watch the games . the buffalo shrimp appetizer as well as the grilled shrimp entree are both great ! my friend always gets the monte cristo sandwich which is amazing . on game days it <unk> be best to get here early
1 over priced for what it is . a good place to have a couple drinks for happy hour
2 very trendy place and atmosphere . food was ok . the ice tea was not that great as they do n't even have regular ice tea . would be a good place for happy hour and appetizers .
2 this is one of my favorite stores to shop at if im looking for organic or something quick where i can just stop and pick up something to make a simple dinner . love their deli , they have all kinds of salads and wraps . their garlic parmesan pita
4 this place is pretty new and is amazing . love the decor and layout . the whole style is southern style but chic . i ordered the prime rib sandwich and it was amazing , along with the avacado and fried green peppers . service was great , extremely prompt
1 not many options . sandwiches bland . roast beef dry and shredded .
2 i 'd give this place 4 stars if not for the chaos ... i ca n't blame the place , it 's popular . problem is it 's almost like a chuck e cheese with all the kids ... very loud . the pizza is stellar , no doubt .
3 i 've been here many times , i just forget to check in . this is becoming one of my favorite places as it 's very cool crowd and it just seems with the open bar you can see across invites more people to interact . the service has always
2 so perhaps i need to get more <unk> in my reviews so yelp will grant me elite status and i can feel better as a human being . : -rrb- so here we go . <unk> but to the point . there are a few breakfast options here in old
3 we stopped by on saturday after going to the burton barr library . my mom actually used to visit this place regularly when she was pregnant with me , she <unk> it 's just as good now ! i was pleasently surprised to see the garden fajitas on the menu
4 i 've been to this ball park several times over the years and i 'm impressed at how well it 's keeping up . i 'm always impressed how clean it is , we were most recently out for fan fest <unk> and again everyone was friendly and the place
4 i love this place still ! it 's amazing and for they have a delicious <unk> burger and some very yummy salads ! service was once again great , and i 'm happy to see some place so consistently good in the west valley that seems to be hard to
4 visited for a book signing and it was great . event was well organized , staff was friendly . definitely my new go to bookstore for when i pick up paper books .
3 not as good as the one in los angeles . it 's pricey but expected in a place like this . unfortunately this is the second time i 've had bad service even before the other half of our six member party showed up . just did n't feel it
4 my favorite is the chicken katsu . just like back home with one scoop rice and authentic mac salad . the cooks and servers are always friendly and the food only takes as long to be made to order . great portions alway have one order for lunch and dinner
4 my boyfriend and i started meeting friends for nfl sundays here and i 'm definitely a fan . good drink specials , great wings and a ton of tvs . the servers are friendly ... no complaints : -rrb-
3 i head to romanelli 's for their deli section and eat in ... their food is fantastic . true italian food ... no one i 've been there with has been disappointed . make sure you come hungry because portions are big and you will leave stuffed . they also
3 i am definitely a fan of joe 's farm grill . my bf and i went on a sunday morning for breakfast and we were definitely pleased . you order at a counter , find a table and wait for your buzzer to beep when they are ready . the

1 <unk> ! i mean ... <unk> !! i guess the endless cheesy <unk> finally got to me . despite my instincts , and the signs -- <unk> logo , aforementioned cheesy <unk> -- i decided to give it a try . the decor was cozy -- <unk> with wine crates
0 i could no longer resist this goofy , red and white striped , old-fashioned sandwich shop . when the craving for a good sandwich kicked in , i decided to give it a shot . as soon as you enter , you are <unk> visually with <unk> -lrb- well ,
3 the coronado cafe seems to be real hit or miss based on the reviews below . i can understand some of the points on the misses , but for me , it was a hit . phx seems to be populated with several of these former houses turned <unk> .
3 what a cool space ! we needed <unk> on st pats , as the corn beef and cabbage they were serving at the irish pub did n't exactly float our boats . we found <unk> at hannys and had a great experience . their pizzas are light and tasty .
1 i was excited about the prospect of pastabar - hipster italian dining in downtown phx . unfortunately , i forgot that too often hipster is synonymous with pretentious . i thought i liked the ambiance of the place , until i found out that supposedly the paintings on the wall
3 i ended up here on st. <unk> day , because i need a true irish drinking experience on st pats and i was told this was the best phx had to offer . and while this ai n't exactly like being in chicago , it 'll more than pass for
2 first impression ... confusing . we parked and walked through the patio where a sign read `` see hostess to be seated '' . when we got inside , there was n't a clear setup for the hostess , there were just these 2 girls -lrb- 1 standing , 1
2 a total dive . it 's a decent size bar . there were only a handful of people in there and it seemed like the ones sitting at the bar were regulars and knew <unk> and the bartenders . they have pbr ... awesome . my husband had a jack

2 my first impression was that it 's `` colorful '' . seriously , everywhere you turn there 's purple , pink , orange , yellow . i liked it . second impression , <unk> at the front desk was so nice and so sweet . she explained everything to us
3 it was really neat getting a sampling of the new bar menu that outback will be introducing in the near future . the drinks were all delicious - i had the sangria and skinny rita . i could n't even tell that the margarita was `` skinny '' - it
3 upper crust is going through a major identity crisis . on the door it says `` patio lounge and wine bar '' which makes you think of postino or some upscale snooty place , but before you even walk in you can see all the tvs showing sporting games through
3 warning : you must have patience in order to come here . but , your patience will be rewarded . the yogurt selection is among the best ; very unique and delicious flavors . i also love how they have `` <unk> '' , in which they give you suggestions
3 at a friend 's recommendation , i went here with my husband and another couple for dinner . i am glad i took that recommendation . it was surprisingly slow for a saturday night . we sat on the back patio that had misters and cool fans that were cleverly

4 love this place ! great outdoor patio with misters , looking out to the lake . food is fantastic , large variety in menu options , best kids menu around and excellent customer service . and to top it off , their prices are very reasonable . a great value
4 my puppies love this place ! when banana was a little one she had a big problem <unk> on anyone she came across . wag and wash accepted banana with open arms . and always had a mop and <unk> available when it was due for her nail appointment .
4 delicious delicious delicious lolo 's will satisfy your craving for southern cooking for the change in your pocket . the option to have all white meat is there although when you come to a place like lolo 's go all the way . the staff is nice and welcoming .
2 it 's a modern strip mall . not very big , but with a few decent restaurants -lrb- by valley standards , not for visitors -rrb- . it feels like they tried to trend it towards professional <unk> rather than families , but they fell flat . everything here is
0 this is easily the most disappointing experience we 've had this year . frustrating - making us `` sign in '' by giving them our phone number , which they 're already texting to get us to sign up for their mailing list . frustrating - over-priced , mediocre food
2 this place is good for happy hour or day drinking during the week . i ca n't say that i would go on the weekend because it just is n't my crowd . it tends to cater to the young and hip crowd who think that a drink called ``
4 my husband has been raving about this place for months and i finally went today . i kept thinking , its just hot dogs , what is the big deal ? but i was thoroughly impressed and i will definitely go back . the owner and cook were friendly and
4 i have now been here twice in one week and that should be all of the review you need . the pizza is as good as i have had here in the valley and if you go on a weeknight there is no wait and the service is so fast
3 i have always been a fan of chipotle 's food but have n't really been <unk> to sit my ample butt down and give them a review . sure the tasty burritos the size of mom 's meatloaf should be worth a few kind words and their delicious guacamole is
3 this serrano 's is my favorite because it is cozy , dark and the service is really fast . i love that you get salsa and bean dip here , and that both are very good . the food is seasoned well and if you add some hot sauce it
3 lo <unk> is a nice little italian restaurant within walking distance of my home . if it was not so close i probably would have never noticed it . i go for the `` early bird '' dinners between 4-6 when you can get smaller portions for great prices .
2 stopped in the other night to grab some sushi after a seeing a movie . the place is small , but has a good friendly vibe . the food - there were 4 of us and we decided to share . we had 3 rolls - spicy tuna -lrb- very

3 here is the quick & dirty : the pho is damn good and very reasonably priced . the rest of the food we got was just so so . that said , since i love pho , i would easily go back .
4 stellar ! one of my favorite places to eat in all of phoenix . sunday happy hour is rock solid - $ 5 small plates -lrb- many -rrb- and half price wine . the menu covers everything you could want - steak , chicken , fish , sandwiches , veggies
3 stopped in for saturday lunch with my son . the place was fairly crowded . although i think that there were more employees then there were customers . that said , we share a couple of tacos , a burger , and some fries . all were good . the
2 <unk> lunch joint . large selection of sandwiches and quick service . slightly higher on the food chain than subway or blimpie .
3 love this place ! i meet my husband here for lunch as often as i can . it is a bit pricey for being a fast food place but the food is so good . i always get the pita pizza and the pasta salad . excellent place to eat
0 i hate to leave a bad review because i really like the decor and feel of this place . i have been here three times in the past year and i am just not crazy about the new menu . my husband had the lasagna last night and could not
2 god , i miss panera bread . that said , this place is a distant second . it 's soups and salads are very good . the sandwiches are consistent and good for a casual lunch . bakery is ok .
3 i have to admit i did n't think i was going to get an as good meal as we did . we ended up going because we got a restaurant.com gift certificate and thought we 'd try a new place . we 've always passed it on camelback and many
3 one of the best sushi restaurants in scottsdale . great place for happy hour -lrb- try the <unk> beef burgers for $ 2 -rrb- . happy hour is from 4-6pm , and after 9pm , so its a great place to go for a later dinner -lrb- its opened until

3 pretty good bagels for arizona . definitely remind me of new york bagels .

2 it had been eons since we were at the wcg , but somehow it seemed like a good choice as with our party of four , we all wanted something different and the wcg menu delivered . first of all , let me proclaim that i was shocked at how
2 in a word ... disappointed ! we arrived in time for happy hour and ordered a number of items from the discounted hh menu -- gyoza , sliders , shrimp tempura , fire dragon rolls and calamari . they brought everything at once -- it hardly fit on the table

3 i love this restaurant ! i 've to the tempe , chandler , scottsdale , and phoenix ones . this location is pretty unknown . the food is still great . the ambiance was a little unwelcoming . the bathroom is super cold , like they want you to go
2 good place for a quick lunch . daily lunch specials are pretty good . fast , friendly service . <unk> soup .
3 this scottsdale location of the national chain does not disappoint . the entire dining experience is very upscale . the vast array of meats are all very well prepared by their excellently trained staff . each of the servers in the restaurant are able to help you , so service
3 fun place to sit and have a few beers before the games at jobing arena . the people watching from the patio area is pretty darn great . wide selection of beers and appetizers . pretty good selection of happy hour items . the service can be a little hit
1 woah ! go to the bathroom ahead of time ! i was shocked at how dirty this place was . there was a huge hole in the ground and fences up to protect people but really for the price i paid for the ticket it should be a better venue
2 i enjoy their happy hour tons but hardly ever eat her for a regular meal because of their frequent dining club card offers are just a joke . they used to do awesome things for birthdays and <unk> but now it seems like the red mask card is a huge
4 this was an amazing spot ! the wait staff is my only concern since the hostess did not seem what was going on but sitting at the bar was the best ! i did not eat any food but trying the sampler beers was amazing . i would have wished
4 all the food is amazing . the <unk> , bruschettas and platters are great balance for the wine selection they have . sundays and mondays are prime days to check this place out for conversation and a nice bottle . i jump in here because the location and finding parking
4 i 've eaten here quite a few times and i absolutely love it . the first time i went i was with a group and as not sure what to expect and it was always a pleasure to dine here . the grilled artichokes are amazing . if you had

1 wow . i used to love this place ! the desserts are now terrible . the foccacia that i was addicted to is now identical to the packaged pizza mix made by hamburger <unk> . the chicken soup noodles were n't cooked . the only thing that is still good
3 on our latest visit here , we ordered the meatball sub , and the eggplant parm sub -- specifically because the owner sent me a very polite e-mail . he was right . the eggplant this time was not greasy . it was delicious and perfectly cooked . the flavors
3 solid mall with tons of store options to choose from in every price range . it was clean , easy to navigate and even though it was a weekend and it was a little busy , it did n't have that crowded tight feel of some other places . i
3 this location was great ! we have been to other gelato spot locations and they were all good stops , and this one takes it to the next level by adding pizza and other menu offerings to the mix . we did n't realize that this was something that they
3 we were in the area to see a show in the jobing.com arena and this particular location was in a shopping plaza near there . they are on the end corner close to the movie theater and this offers a decent view from both inside and the porch outside .
3 this is a great little spot for a night walk and some window shopping , a weekend stroll for lunch and actual shopping , or bringing that visiting friend / family member to show them the artsy side of scottsdale while getting a bite to eat from a great restaurant
3 this ikea has an extra large parking spot , so even though you may be a bit of a walk from the door , you can always find a spot . it 's set up like pretty much every other ikea we have been to . second floor is the
3 i love this place . it 's hard not to enjoy yourself at a midget bar . i would n't eat here under the <unk> of circumstances but for a few drinks and a good time with friends you can not beat it .
2 do n't kid yourselves ... this is n't great bbq . it is good though . the sauces are pretty bad . that 's ok with as i like to taste the meat and not an overwhelming sauce . it 's tacky in it 's atmosphere but comfortable . you
2 not sure what the hype is . i 've been here several times and its a decent breakfast place . one item i do like are their waffles . these waffles have the smaller squares like the ones you make at home . they 're pretty solid .
3 great natural ingredients , simple and wonderful .
3 this is a fabulous market if you are looking for asian products . the meat department is varied with almost any meat you can think of conventional or not . the pricing on conventional items such as chicken or steak or short ribs -lrb- which was i was looking for
3 definitely old school , kind of dark , well run place . we had the trout special -lrb- 17 -rrb- and crab cakes -lrb- 19 -rrb- -- came with a full salad bar with all the fixings -- a really nice salad bar . crab cakes were good and trout

1 i was all enthused after reading the great reviews on yelp . this place is run by a nice family and it is clean . that being said , this is not your top-notch chinese food . if any yelpers have been to ny or san francisco , you know
3 i struggle a great deal figuring out how many stars to give four peaks . if i could give the beer more than five stars , i would , but the actual brewery really drags down their star average . i love the rustic , no ac feel of four
1 people must come here for the owners or the pizza , because what we experienced last night was just mediocre . the penne in cream sauce was just plain . presentation was <unk> . caesar was okay . chicken was dry and there was a bit too much dressing .
2 i 'd give them five stars if the servers were n't <unk> all of the time and the bathrooms were n't a mess . and by mess i mean the <unk> dispensers are broken , some doors do n't have locks , and they smell bad . otherwise , the

2 beautiful property , nice place to spend a lazy weekend morning . but the food is overpriced , and really small in quantity . i got the italian sandwich with meats and <unk> and cheese ... it was good , though very much on the salty side . my friend

3 this restaurant is 1 of my very few favorite vietnamese restaurants in phoenix area . one of their main selling point for me is the restaurant is extremely clean and nicely decorated . also , i never have to wait too long for the order to come out . the

3 came here for brunch with my girlfriends , and i just fell in love with the ambiance , the service , and especially the dessert . we got duck confit sandwich , croque monsieur ou madame -lrb- sandwich of ham , gruyere and <unk> sauce -rrb- and veal <unk> -lrb-

3 if you do n't know or love harlows ... well then get on it . this place with it 's casual morning after atmosphere and large menu is just what any hangover would order . greasy , cheap , tasty , and fast . the wait staff are always friendly
2 food is ok . standard fair . good selection overall , and friendly staff . seems always busy and for me it was the only option open on new years day before we ran out of patience and just wanted breakfast . not bad ... just never been blown away
3 so i 've always loved this place ... it continues to expand and grow . breakfast is wonderful and light , homemade english muffins for egg and avocado sandwiches = awesome ! fruit mixtures are tasty . great coffee and sweets . then we have the pizza !! fresh local

0 beware ! place has become pretentious . cover for women now and expensive drinks .
1 the service was great , but the food was meh . we had the bruchetta as an appetizer . the flavors did not blend well at all . they should be considering it 's an italian resturant . we ordered the shrimp lobster <unk> to share . well , there
3 i 've been here twice and i 've enjoyed it both times ! okay , honestly , i 've been here twice but both were for its happy hour , which is decent . i would n't be able to tell you the exact prices of their happy hour menu

2 it was ok , the meat lack some salt or some magic spice -lrb- like other places -rrb- . the place looks kinda crappy but attention is ok . still i think i 'll stick to my carl 's ... more juicy and tasty
3 for one single reason ... attention was awesome !!! we were a group of more than 10 and they made a great job taking our orders and helping us to pay . food tasted really good , every body left with a happy face and some , we had to
3 love their heffe <unk> !! and they have other kinds of beers that taste good . their appetizers and sandwiches are well served . it get 's crowded in their happy hours so make sure to have patience to find a spot to park .
3 mainly for their drinks and the happy hour on wednesdays !!! we had many different things for food and all tasted really good . the place has nice decoration and you really feel comfortable wherever you sit . the 5th star will come when they do n't force you to
2 this place is a real hidden gem ! in fact if you are distracted you will miss it over and over . a really tiny place and usually gets very busy . we were a group of 6 that because of the change in time with our reservation , some

2 first of all - you know this is n't sushi , right ? yeah , its not . and quite frankly , its not a dinner spot either . do n't let that asian menu fool you ... the tables are awkward to sit at , the plates and portions
4 sidebar is a great downtown spot . always a good vibe , good music , nice mix of people and great cocktails . perfect for a nightcap after dinner at one of phoenix 's many unique downtown restaurants .
2 i do n't get it . i really do n't . i feel like i could be stoned to death in phoenix for saying this but duck & decanter just is not that good . first of all , it 's in a parking lot . like , seriously by
2 do n't know about the nightlife scene here -lrb- anymore -rrb- but you really ca n't beat their happy hour . its the good ` ol 2-for-1 cocktails and free food until 7pm ! ca n't beat that .
3 for some reason i find it incredibly difficult to find a good sandwich in this town - its either subway or a sit-down restaurant so i was thrilled when i found sacks ... a happy medium . it 's perfect for a midweek sandwich with coworkers . its a no-frills
3 dreading the long week and need a quick fix before the weekend hits ?! head down over to this <unk> of upscale delight that serves up a tasty mediterranean menu that will keep your wallet and plastic cards happy . if you are savvy with the fox concept brand ,

4 the <unk> and build up by food media was no joking matter as i can finally attest to one of the most <unk> pizza joints on american <unk> ! as the great bobby flay had once announced to a crowd of phoenicians that bianco 's pie can very well stack
3 the quality of the sushi here is fantastic . the last time i came here i had one with foie gras and it was just delicious , making it unique and distinct from the usual . for desert , i had green tea cheese cake ! the bomb ! the

4 first , there 's a $ 10 discount on the entire fixed menu during happy hour , which -lrb- i believe -rrb- runs from 3-6 . if posh is usually a little out of your budget , this can be a <unk> , especially if you 're going for the

3 bless them , lee 's is now open until 8 pm !
3 this place was way cooler than i expected . first of all it 's huge . they host events -lrb- an art gallery when i was there -rrb- . they have a prohibition theme , so they have all these drinks from `` prohibition era '' that are pretty rare
2 i guess maybe i had high expectations about this place with so many great reviews . sure , it has local ingredients and a hipster ambiance , but the food just did n't seem that great . i got the grilled chicken sandwich , my girlfriend got the crab cakes
4 phoenix , we need to seriously recognize that we have a great thing going here and <unk> it . we 're <unk> cool , our best restaurant is a pizza place , we 're a tough crowd who has a artistic bent , we need to celebrate that . sucker

3 fantastic to find a theatre that plays <unk> movies stuffed with car <unk> , gun <unk> and curse words . better than that , this theatre caters to the independent and more <unk> unique movies . i saw the namesake here , as well as paris j' <unk> . this
3 trendy , yes . small , yes . dark , yes . but i like this place . the doorman was friendly , as was the bartender . my friends and i found a place at the bar and watched the room fill up . it was a friday night
3 best damn salad i 've ever had in my life . based on that alone , i give houston 's 4 stars . perhaps someday i 'll venture back to sample their dinner menu .
4 since <unk> ... that 's how long i 've been a phoenix fan . yes , since the days of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , majerle and coach paul <unk> . sure , it may have been the beginning of `` the <unk> era , '' but to me
4 delish ! i ca n't even begin to tell you the number of different dishes i 've ordered here , but each one always satisfies . there 's always plenty to take home for second servings . the service is average - definitely nothing to complain about , but certainly
3 4-stars for this simple reason : it 's low key and unpretentious . whether it 's tuesday or saturday , there 's room for you . it may not be at the bar , but there 's room . i prefer this place on a weekday . sit at the
4 one of the best places on roosevelt row , made has a plethora of things to catch your eye and keep your attention . from funny gifts to thoughtful ones , this store is a gold mine , if you 're looking to please a friend , partner or work
2 `` hand rubbed meat ca n't be beat . '' that 's what a t-shirt reads . it 's hung up on the wall next to other things , like posters with catchy phrases and local <unk> of hap 's being the best bbq around town . this place is
3 art . everywhere . even in the architecture . that 's what i like about the phoenix art museum . from fashion to photography to sculpture and the revolving door of special exhibits , this museum has an appeal . sure , you may not encounter the <unk> of paintings
2 ahem . this place turned me off . from the parking lot having valet -lrb- and almost no open spot for me to park -rrb- to the cold shoulder i got when i walked in , i felt very unwelcome . instincts took me right to where i needed to
2 matt 's big breakfast ? i 'd say the only thing big about this place is the wait . when you walk up to the tiny place -lrb- it looks like a miniature brick block that you 're not sure is big enough for humans -rrb- , you <unk> your
2 i do n't really like going to this theater because it 's <unk> to not only a huge mall but also game works . but , alas , you can bet you 'll find a parking space - you just may have to walk a little bit . the theater
3 so ... i caved and i 've been back to rnr and this time around , it was a lot better . the bartenders are nice , the service i 've had has definitely exceeded my last experience ... the only thing i have n't really tried is the menu
3 okay ... so i kind of cheat . i write about places i 've already been to but i 'm new to yelp and trust me , i have a new destination planned out <unk> shortly . what ca n't i say about the <unk> ? i 've heard about
4 why i have n't written a review for windsor earlier i 'm not sure as i 've been going there since it first opened but it 's a good one so i guess better late than never ! the owners of postino just ca n't go wrong i 'm convinced
3 i love chinese food and i wish i could eat it all the time , but then i would be like 600 lbs . they have a great dim sum ... its a great deal ... and i really enjoy their dumplings . they have great lunch specials which include

3 can i just say that this place would have gotten 5 stars but the staff was lacking ... our waiter was amazing and he <unk> <unk> moon ... it was delicious ... its a half <unk> <unk> mandarin and half a shot of peach <unk> ... with an orange slice
4 talk about one of the best burgers in town ... in fact i think houstons and this place have the best burgers in phoenix !!!! i took one bite and i was in heaven ... it was a whole new take on a burger but not too crazy !! i

4 this little place is great ! i just tried it today with friends of mine at lunch ... it 's a cute little cafe and they bake all their baked goods ... i only had the little red velvet cupcake but the frosting was delicious and the cake was so

4 my new favorite spot . $ 2 <unk> after 10 , at least on saturdays . there 's nothing i can knock on this place . reminds me of the great restaurants in which i used to work . the beet and watermelon dish with fresh goat cheese and pumpernickel
3 great fresh sushi and hamachi kama . i spent a half hour talking with sushi chef sun and sakana has become my sushi home away from home -lrb- sushi on <unk> in tucson -rrb- . the service is very accommodating , although one time i went the waitress literally screamed
3 yep . i am fine ! good , quick , and tasty american favorite ! how can i not be dammit . everyone go check it out at least once . if i was gf i be all over the shakes they have too . quality service as well !
4 this has to be one of thee best breakfast spots in metro phoenix ! the service and the quality of food at the price point is out of this world ! make this place somewhere you regular hit for breakfast .
1 z pizza you are nothing special . rubbery salty crust . your whole pizza is merely so so and your slices border on abysmal . staff did n't seem to care if i was there or not . the owner was there and that was more important than my late
0 sushi brokers is the ra of sushi bars . -lrb- see what i did there ? -rrb- i have been only once and was so disappointed i could n't drag myself back . it 's one of those sushi bars that make up for a lack of quality product by
3 yeah ... ... . what everyone else said ... ... food is great . restaurant is small . line is long . service is great . if they delivered this would be the world 's best breakfast place . even if they had take out . but delivery ? that
1 i guess i had more expectations of this place from seeing it on food network . the food was good but the service , decor and music was not good . i only gave 2 stars since i enjoyed my meal . my daughter had the pizza and i had
3 first time here ... love their motto ... `` breakfast , lunch and bacon '' . visited with my boyfriend and his 2 children . enjoyed the food a lot . had breakfast of an omlette filled with <unk> , red and green bell peppers and turkey sausage . it
4 i have traveled to scottsdale for years and always have enjoyed old town . this place has change a ton with more new , hot restaurants , places to live as well as the nightlife . the art walk on thursday 's is a great event . many of the
2 this is a great place to enjoy <unk> teppanyaki . the are a ton of options including steaks , seafood and veggies where they put on a great show . some of their food is excellent , especially the filet . i 'd pass on most seafood , except the
2 this is a busy place with an inexperienced waitstaff . the restaurant is located a pretty good hike from mainstream scottsdale , so the advantage is little , to no tourists . the servers are covering a lot of tables and the menu is extremely broad , maybe too broad
4 i read in the arizona republic a great article about `` maui 's favorite '' opening in scottsdale , thursday . i was so stoked , as this is one my all-time favorite spots for fish tacos . i even planned my day around eating fish tacos for lunch .
2 maybe i 'm a bit spoiled having a hillstone , r & d kitchen and bandera all within walking distance . so , when i go to houston 's in another city , i expect it to be as good as home . this scottsdale location has some of what
4 i brought the work crew out for dinner at the roaring fork . every single person was amazed . personally , i have had a ton of great meals here , so i was n't surprised . this trip was : starter : new pork wing appetizer with the old

2 maybe the santa monica fairmont <unk> spoiled me , but i was n't blown away with this property . several years ago , when the <unk> was a fairmont property , we had several events at the phoenician and it was truly 5-star . however , for some reason the
4 i love that kierland commons has so many unique shops and excellent restaurants . the outdoor feel v fashion square 's big anchor store feel is pleasant . bobby 's and zinc are excellent places to eat and now that the quarter has filled out across the street , there
4 this is my favorite restaurant in a city crowded with excellent choices . mission is in it 's own league and continues to be creative . i 'll quote my prior review : `` the almejas al vapor is an incredible dish . '' words do not do this restaurant
3 food is yummy , depending on my mood it seems over-priced at times . decor is awesome , clean nice bathrooms . drinks are usually delicious but sometimes inconsistent . the best time i have had here was later in the evening for an appetizer and drinks at the bar
3 i went here with a friend for some food to go and had a good experience . i got the pork torta and my friend got 3 tacos , one chicken , one fish , and one steak . my torta was okay , the pork seemed extremely salty though
3 the only issue i have with this place is parking when it 's busy , but really , that 's not even that bad ! the coffee is yum , the pastries delicious , and when i need some brain food after studying their hummus plate always hits the spot
3 i have bought a few different things here but mostly i go here for the irish bacon . if your a bacon fan you really need to try it , it 's awesome ! they also have grass fed beef
3 i was in arcadia today and saw this place so i had to try it out . the menu has some variation from the normal thai restaurant as well as some classics . i decided to try the jalapeno curry . i was surprised it was not as spicy as
4 this is my favorite asian grocery store and fish market in phoenix . i come here and pick out my fish then do the rest of my shopping while they fillet them . they have a very good selection of fresh produce and various asian specialty items . this is

4 i went here last night for a burger and tried the standard with cheese and added the jalapenos . i loved the burger and it was definitely one of the best burgers i have had lately . the service here was exceptional , they seemed like they really wanted to
3 ate here yesterday with a friend for breakfast . they had good friendly service and the food was very good also . i tried the mexican benedict and was impressed , it was original and had good flavor . my friend and i both really liked the potatoes they serve
3 went here for street tacos tonight and they were very good , nice little place and you can have a beer with your food while catching some sports on the television . i 'll eat here again next time i 'm in the area .
2 i am a fan of alcoholic ice cream and this place is a-okay in my book . i got one scope of the black russian -lrb- kahlua -rrb- and it was good . my scope was $ <unk> -lrb- including tax -rrb- , which may be a bit high ,

3 chompies offers my personal favorite fish and chips in arizona for breakfast i have really enjoyed the teh <unk> french toast , it is amazing with a extra kick with the <unk> sprinkled on top . i have always enjoyed the personal service even when the place is crowded ,

3 got to give them four stars , above the crowed , cooked to order food here is simply great . yes butter burger is a fun time but the real mean is their entrees fried chicken and fried cod , they keep their fries clean and use a great breading
3 five stars is awarded for great food and its atmosphere . a half star is taken away for service , i have n't seen much <unk> or extra hands to assist the waiters . the total experience at az 88 is hip and relaxing i love to bring people from
3 lights at desert botanical gardens , wow , the blown glass brings a new beautiful look to the dbg . bring a special someone here to stroll around after or before you go to dinner . chihuly is a display of blown glass with amazing colors and arrangements mixed in
3 any place that has belly dancers shake their stuff in your face during dinner gets high marks in my book . i think the belly dancer -lrb- s -rrb- are there only on the weekends around 8 , but you might want to check it out . loved the food

3 been here many times and always enjoy myself . good wine , and there always quick with the fresh bread to start the meal . chicken piccata is sooooooo tasty . i would like to try more items but usually stick to this one . i had the linguini alla

4 so the resort is great , ca n't say anything bad about it . sure , the <unk> ride is kinda cheesy i admit , but come on , it 's pretty unique for the <unk> desert . live music is usually pretty good grown up flamenco stuff , hey
3 this place packs you in like sardines but that fact aside i liked it . had the fish special and it was amazing . super light and tender with a tomato sauce -lrb- not marinara -rrb- on top . the eggplant parm was good with a huge side of pasta
4 holy cow is this some yummy bbq . hubby went on opening day and stood around in the az sun , just to get some grub . he 's been talking abt it ever since . we went today as a family and he was not kidding ! the ribs

3 as we arrived at fnb we immediately felt right at home . there was a faint smell of toasted marshmallows in the air and the hustle and bustle of chef <unk> badman 's small open kitchen felt like being at mom 's . the warm glow of owner/manager pavle <unk>
4 for the phoenix metro , it does n't get much better then this ! they even sell tapioca <unk> for my occasional much needed bubble tea fix ! plus they sell tendon and trip for pho . . oh the delights and treasures in store for me on each visit
3 by now , i 'm guessing that everyone has been to postino winecafe . if for some cosmic reason you have n't made it , you really should . sometimes you just are n't ready to go straight home from work . that 's when it 's time to tap
