3 we love mojo ! its not as evil of a treat and the flavors are so yummy ! a minor downfall is how the mix-ins are sometimes hard to reach and i 've seen a girl literally put her whole head into the bar and that grossed me out with
3 this is a casual spot to eat with friends before going out into old town . servers are hit or miss but just this last visit our server was very flexible with the menu and willing to <unk> things to make us happy . they recently added sushi to the
4 best steak in town hands down ! great crowd , live music , professional servers , wonderful menu . the lobster mashed potatoes are a must try on the menu !! i had one martini and could n't finish the second because the first one did enough damage : -rrb-
1 we went for lunch and i made the mistake of ordered the shrimp tacos and a <unk> because i was craving them . the fiance -lrb- yes , we 're engaged ! -rrb- ok , so he ordered a burger and kiltlifter . the food came and my tacos were
4 from beginning to the end , durants was flawless . no windows in the place , and red booths fill the room . a large inviting bar , and old rat pack feel from the place . if i could afford to dine here often i would be one fat
2 my wife really wanted to come here . i used to think this was the best in town , but things have changed . it seems like every time i walk away from here my thoughts are on `` i just paid $ ... for that ! '' it seems
4 just wonderful ! i love the coffee here . the atmosphere is war and friendly . a lot of friendly people hanging out .
3 these 4 stars are all based on expectations . what do you expect when you go to greasewood <unk> ? what are your expectations when you go to a bar that has mostly outdoor seating ; picnic tables ; open fire pits ; <unk> <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ;
3 the food & beverages at moto are awesome . the service needs a little help , as they do n't always check on you to see if you need another beer or a water refill . they might just need more staff . i award 4 stars because i know
3 what a breath of fresh fresh air . the owner of this restaurant actually took my <unk> criticism and made some very positive changes based on them . how awesome is that ? regarding the rice , apparently the staff who previously told me that they used chicken stock was
2 i like the comparison to lady & the <unk> that nathan s. made in his review . this place totally reminds me of that scene too with the red & white checkered table cloths . the service at anzio 's is usually very good . the salads are very good
3 i 've always wondered what a breakfast pizza would be like and i finally found out at my visit to scramble . i ordered up the garlic spinach , thyme & mushroom brizza -lrb- which also comes with some type of cheese , possibly provolone -rrb- . this thing was
1 seeing the word `` hippies '' in the restaurant name had me stoked , as them <unk> hippie types got to have some vegetarian food , right ? yep . i walked up to the lil window and asked about the veggie options , the guy behind the counter informed
3 i 'm giving <unk> n <unk> 4 stars for their mini-golf . four separate courses , plenty of creative greens & <unk> , lots of decorations , statues , structures , fountains , everything that makes up a good miniature golf course . oh , and did i mention they
4 alright loving hut , let 's face the facts , i love you and you love me . your `` <unk> '' of using `` love '' in your establishment name has paid off , as you have enamored me with your delicious , 100 % vegan food as well
4 great food , great portions , great prices .
3 had a great happy hour there this week . great food and <unk> recommend the moscow mule .
3 love the view and good food . had the lobster carbonara as my meal with the king pao green beans . they are both listed as sides , but make a surprisingly great pairing . enjoy !
2 not too impressed with the food , luckily we were with great friends so we had a fun time .
3 great food and service . only <unk> cause of outside patio furniture was horrible and prices .
4 <unk>
1 i was not impressed with the sauce . and the beef seemed real greasy . im use to sliced beef instead of shredded . corn bread fell apart into a million crumbs when i took it out of the wrapper . i just wasnt impressed at all . the people
2 my very first try of ethiopian . went at lunch hour . selected menu items 3 , 4 , 5 . 1 meat and 2 vegetarian . the food came out within a minute or 2 - so they must have some buffet line inside . the food kind of
3 a trendy looking restaurant and bar . we ordered the ribs and grits , seafood <unk> , <unk> down cake , roasted cauliflower . also enjoyed a few cocktails . everything was really good - really like the blue cheese grits . i recommend !!!
3 wanted to go to a gastropub , and ended up here . this is a really nice place inside . comfortable seating of all types . a big bar . the kitchen is wide open for all to see . the restrooms are clean and nice , too . we

2 convenient - close to the house and easy . this was my first time here and it was eh . i got the beef and broccoli - i know , not a traditional thai dish by any means , but i was in the mood . the sauce was good
4 this is our go to delivery pizza . they always say it will take 45 minutes , but they are here in 30 and sometimes under . we live very close but other places have n't delivered as fast as these guys . we usually end up ordering on sundays
4 although some of the guys seemed a bit confused around lunch time , the service was great and quick . this was my first time eating here and its great pizza with great ranch dressing . we had pepperoni and cheese slices with a salad . the salad was big
4 i love everything about this place and i eat at a pita jungle at least once a week . here 's why i love this place ... first , the waitresses are all super cool and <unk> . if you 're a <unk> chick with a couple of tattoos ,
3 happy to stumble upon this place while looking for a munch on our way to a concert at the marquee theater . really , really good carne asada . we had burritos , and the trio chip platter which includes chips , salsa and guacamole . the guac and the

3 three things on the menu . pizza , calzones and salads . that 's it . all done very well , in a great atmosphere with attentive service . the pizza menu has no suggestions , just a list of toppings , accordingly , you have ... no meat lovers
3 -lrb- keep in mind there are few choices for hawaiian style fast food in az so this might influence my review -rrb- . i love going here when i have a craving for hawaiian food . i usually order the bbq mix <unk> <unk> of beef , chicken and short
3 nice place to try a different kinda of sandwich if you 're tired of chains like subway . i love their housemade mozzarella , local tomato & basil : food was fresh and the bread was excellent . i also tried the tuna with red onion , <unk> olives ,
1 i 've been to buffalo wild wings before , but my first visit at this location was during ufc 117 . if you come here to watch fighting events like ufc i would recommend arriving 2 hours before the main card starts if you want a seat inside . i
3 i would go there much more if i was closer . always find very interesting items . like it when they sample the food . i got hooked with the lasagna and have been buying it ever since . this store as with other trader joes can get super busy
3 i have tried a couple other vietnamese food restaurants and think tea lite has the freshest ingredients and best overall flavor . # 1 or # 3 depending if i want more beef or spring rolls . the pork ball sandwich is also tasty . the soups are great when
3 easy to find what you are looking for . parking lot is big . it is nice and clean . fyi . i do n't shop here for the gas .
2 it would get 5 stars if sandbar patrons did not take all the parking spots . that is very annoying !! last night i could not find a place to park , so i went to albertsons to purchase my alcohol . take notice total wine , you are losing
3 one word ... chicken tikka masala ! ok ... it 's one word if you say it like i do . i like to say it fast so i can hurry up and get past the ordering part and on to the eating part . this place is awesome .
3 this place is fantastic ! customer service was great and the prices are very reasonable . we kinda wandered our way into the chinese cultural center on a lazy sunday afternoon , i needed to pick up a couple of things from the market , and have been craving some

2 i know artists * in general * totally hate when you compare their new stuff to their old stuff ... but here goes ! i absolutely loved sens. . . and fate . sochu house is n't quite there for me . do n't get me wrong , the food

4 ever since my bf recently discovered frozen yogurt -lrb- yeah , he 's a little slow to jump on the bandwagon -rrb- , we 've been trying different yogurt places around town . i usually get dragged to a yogurt dessert after eating ridiculously large meals , so thank goodness
4 pane bianco is a great place to take out of towners . my sister was visiting from chilly boston last weekend , so i was determined keep her outdoors in this beautiful weather as much as possible . after roaming the downtown phoenix farmer 's market , we enjoyed lunch
4 what a drive , but what a nice was to spend an early afternoon ! i had a groupon to use , so a friend and i hiked south mountain and then went over to the farm for lunch . we stood in line raving over all the delicious food
3 i 'm pretty <unk> , but yard house has avoided my chain restaurant <unk> . they have a wide variety of food and beers on their menu . i had been with friends several times and had n't found any dish that stood out , then i went with one
3 my boyfriend and i went to district before a concert at the us airways center . perfect location for a downtown event , plus they will validate your valet parking . we went in time for their happy hour -lrb- which ends a 7pm -rrb- and sat at one of
3 i 've been in tanzy for drinks -lrb- they definitely have some good ones , but the one i remembered was the ginger sangria - memorable in a bad way . it tasted like <unk> or as my boyfriend put it `` this tastes like a hippie '' -rrb- .
3 a nice selection of yogurt and toppings . i usually get the tart yogurt with fruit on top , but they have a variety of other good flavors . reasonable pricing -lrb- <unk> compared to other yogurt places -rrb- . i 've always had friendly service . good product ,
2 some of our food was good , some was eh . my boyfriend and i went to stax for lunch last friday . neither of us had been there and we wanted a place with patio seating . we started looking at the menu and matt said he was going

4 a true owner operated gem in scottsdale all because razz knows and cares . he is an amazing chef who is fearless and cooks and <unk> seamlessly throughout the evening . his food is wonderful and complex with many layers of flavors and ingredients you will often not find elsewhere
0 what happened to this place ? it used to be one of my favorite places and now the food has gone way down hill . worse , our family has gotten food poisoning the last two times they ate there so it is no more for us . what a
3 great food for sure but that is it . unless you are shopping for groceries then do n't expect much of anything you would not find in a cafeteria . yet for some reason this place just works . the service is unusually good in a place like this and

2 if you love beer then come here . great craft tap selection , plus they include the serving glass type . my favorite menu item , so far , are the spam sliders . spam you say , yes ! give it a try , it is far different then
4 yeah , its that good ! this place has a complete relaxed atmosphere . there were several customers sitting outside with their dogs enjoying their favorite fro-yo . if i am craving frozen yogurt next time or any type of dessert for that matter , i will be stopping by
1 we no longer buy our meat from this place because the quality of service and product has been going down and down over the last year or so . after having to throw away the ground beef for the second time , we finally made the switch to <unk> for

4 i considered lying and stating in my review that the dogs were awful solely to reduce the number of people waiting in line for them , but i realized that would be extremely selfish . i am astounded that the hot dog i ate was as good as it was
3 worth a visit . the food is solid , the atmosphere interesting , the prices surprisingly cheap . mimosas and bloody marys -lrb- big ones -rrb- for 3 bucks . that 's what i 'm talking about . i 've eaten here twice and both times the service was good
3 solid diner style breakfast place . the food is nothing special , but it 's always up to par . the price is reasonable as well , and they always seem relatively clean .
3 tuck shop you 've got nothing on lo lo 's chicken and waffles . i wanted to love your chicken and waffles , but it was too weird . cheese in the waffle ? the pork tenderloin saved the day for us . it is well worth returning solely for
3 the cheese selection is very large and reasonably priced for the kinds of cheese available . that is not to say that duck and decanter is cheap . i prefer the staff at the north central location over this location . duck and decanter almost has a monopoly on unique

2 i have been coming here for a few years , it is not my first choice . it seems we always have a birthday or someone else 's get together , the food and service is good , however for my personal taste it is not something memorable .
2 not very impressed with this place . the food was ok but nothing i would go back for . if my friends want to meet there again , i might go . i did n't care for my chicken chopped salad . i had time that afternoon , so i
3 this is an outdoors person 's heaven . that is not me , but i can appreciate it . i came here because they had a killer deal on keen shoes for the kids . we love those shoes , but paying $ 50 a piece can bite , so
3 what a fabulous place . we had a blast last night and we ca n't wait to come back with the twins .
3 this location has it down ! they know how to handle families with kids . we come here about once every ten days . they are very fast and always bring the kids food first , which makes for a more relaxed time -lrb- if you can relax with two

2 i was hoping for more out of this place : -lrb- i do n't think i will be returning for a round 2 . place could work on its service a little .

3 i love dive bars and unlike many other dive bars , monkey pants is one with a younger crowd ... one where you will not be the only person without an <unk> card in your wallet . the bartender looked like the main male character from -lrb- 500 -rrb- days
4 i can not believe i have n't reviewed coach house yet . this is truly my favorite bar and always my ` go-to ' spot . great location in old town but without the typical scottsdale crowd . lots of parking . great bartenders . cheap and strong drinks -lrb-
4 one of the best restaurants i 've had the luxury of dining at in decades . i could n't in good <unk> deny my worst <unk> the opportunity to eat at such a <unk> venue . the short ribs were melt-in-your-mouth <unk> fantastic . the signature cocktails are so fanciful

3 every time i go there it seems to be about the same great atmosphere . excellent service , cheerful wait staff , clean restrooms , tables and the selection in live music is awesome . i always recommend any of my friends to this place when we want to hang

3 the food was fabulous . the service and atmosphere were wonderful . on a beautiful day like today , it was the perfect setting to sit out on the patio . it is worth saving room for dessert . i took half of my lunch home so that i could

4 i love this place . it has the perfect lunch portions , atmosphere and menu . i think it would be hard to find a better place for lunch . yum !
2 the setting reminds me of an upscale diner and every time i have been in it has been packed . i usually opt to sit at the bar because the service is much faster . last time i came in i had the veggie omelet , and while drowning in
2 i frequent this valle luna often because my grandmother loves it . it has been one of her favorite restaurants for over 3 decades and what <unk> wants <unk> gets . the <unk> decline in the customer service has become painfully obvious over the years . the food usually arrives
4 holy canolli this place is fantastic ! how have i never been here before ? the set up of the restaurant is very open and they <unk> in old school tunes , frank sinatra , harry james and tommy <unk> . it really reminded me of <unk> bucco 's sister
2 switch is a standard three stars . i love love love fez and do n't want to diss the <unk> ... but the food here is pretty bland . they could definitely update their menu , at first it seems decent , then you realize the items are the same
3 why did i love this place so much ? + free <unk> icecream + loads of organic produce and bread + no high fructose corn syrup -lrb- unless you get a soda -rrb- + excellent spicey tortilla soup + quick , healthy and delicious + my bf got the potatoe
1 i had lunch here again the other day and i realize i was either very high or absolutely starving last time i ate here . this visit i pretty much had the opposite experience . the food was horrible . the salsa had chunks of tomatoes as big as my
2 tasteful atmosphere with a great patio , a cozy bar area with stylish mood lighting , a sleek dining room <unk> with red leather chairs , leafy potted plants , and mirrors along the <unk> walls . they have a good variety of dishes to choose from , all prepared
3 best damn zucchini fries i have ever had , sprinkled with parmesan and served with a home made ranch . they are in no way healthy and in every way delicious . these things will blow your mind . my favorite is the samburger $ 10 , applewood smoked bacon
2 closed , it is now called <unk> .
3 i am officially a dropout . this fox restaurant is humongous ! the transformation of the old motorcycle shop was perfectly executed -lrb- see pics -rrb- . the dropout bar is big and gorgeous , the inside gives you full view of the kitchen and the awesome <unk> working behind
1 perhaps i had too high of expectations , but tee pee is no bueno . the only saving grace was the salsa , spicy and delicious . i ordered a bean and cheese burrito , enchilada style with extra garnish . the plate i was given spent way too much
3 went to fuego again the other night and was equally impressed . i got the camarones patron -lrb- which i think is my favorite dish so far -rrb- and it was spicy and delicious . the service was excellent as was the sangria .

3 i can never go wrong with a restaurant from fox concepts it seems ! the bar area is definitely good ` people watching ' and i love the modern contemporary decor . where did they get the lighting for the bar area ? the menu is healthy mediterranean and i
1 over-priced , over-crowded and every time i have been there ... it has confirmed that they pour the worst martini ! but if you are looking to ` people watch ' this is the place - the interior permits a great open ambiance with an open area overlooking the bar

4 matt 's big breakfast is the best breakfast in phoenix . fresh , organic , and wherever possible , local ingredients , cooked up to perfection . delicious coffee . crowded , especially on weekends . worth the wait . get there early or after rush hour on weekdays .
2 good variety of <unk> food , big portions . not sure about how healthy the food is - it seems a bit greasy / fatty . but there 's definitely something here for everybody in your party , meat lover to vegetarian .

2 cabela 's is a good store to go and just browse . the animal decor is by far one of the <unk> things here . also getting any <unk> <unk> here is a good thing because the people here are more knowledgeable then your typical walmart sports department worker .

3 great choice for lunch in phoenix ! i ordered the pad thai which was the perfect amount of spice . i 've never finished an entire plate at a thai restaurant , but i did here . the portion was decent but not gigantic like other restaurants in the area
3 i 'm a sucker for <unk> that have been featured on the food network or top chef . i 'm also a sucker for a hearty breakfast . over easy fits the bill for both . we arrived around 10:30 a & only had to wait about 10 minutes .
3 i went to zoe 's kitchen for lunch last week & had a great meal . i ordered the chicken salad & fruit plate which was pretty big . by the time i ate the chicken salad & fruit i was so full i could n't eat the remaining greens

2 this is the type of restaurant you only go to once . i have now been there twice - once at the old location , once at the new one . the reason you only go there once ? holy wait time , batman . i 'm sorry , but
2 from what i remember -lrb- it has been a few months -rrb- , the food was ok , and the ambience was quite lovely . it 's a converted historic home , so it definitely has a lot of charm . there is handmade art on the walls -lrb- some

4 went for a weekday lunch with the boyfriend because this place was so highly recommended by matt s -lrb- who is currently `` the duke '' here on yelp 's new check-in app -rrb- . we barely found this place because it 's tucked into the corner of a strip
3 i 've been to teakwoods a couple different times and have enjoyed myself each and every time . my last visit was one of the most memorable . we were there in large group and they ran out of the larger draft glasses on the last 2 of us -lrb-

3 went there for lunch today ... i was craving a burger when a coworker suggested this place . it was exactly what i was looking for . the sliders reminded my of a place that i frequented in <unk> , nj called white <unk> ... the sliders that chicago hamburger

0 yes , this has dropped to a single star for me after our last experience . we went in for a weekday lunch , so it was n't super busy . i 'd say the quality of the food is the same . what caused the change ? the german
2 this was a tricky review to write . i really wanted to like this place , it came so highly recommended , but my experience was less than ideal . we went on a thursday for their $ 25 couples menu . i 'll start at the beginning ... the
4 this has been a staple for me since moving to arizona in 2001 . i 've gone every year , and have only gone twice in street clothes . every other time i 've gone , i 've been in `` <unk> '' -lrb- clothes that fit the <unk> -rrb-
2 this place is more about the scene than the sushi . i just do n't think that the sushi is anything to write home about .
1 i used to be a regular here , but have stopped going because of the atrocious service i received on my last visit . i will admit they do have some decent food and , depending on who you get as a server , the service can be decent too
1 this place was just ok for me . the service is slow and they do n't make enough use of the outdoor patio dining space . they only had 3 tables out there and the space could easily and comfortably accomodate at least another 3 tables . i had the
2 i must say that i am very impressed by the ownership . within <unk> i received a response to my review from tom . this tells me that the owners are serious about getting things right and genuinely interested in their customer 's feedback .
3 jalapeno cornbread ... <unk> . known for <unk> chicken and it is quite good and so is the rest of the menu . i could get full on the cornbread and be fat and happy and ready to go . there usually tends to be a wait on the weekends
3 boar 's head meat and thick toasted bread make these sandwiches some of my favorite . the soups are okay , but put them in a fresh bread bowl and who cares ? the southwestern club is my fave with the tasty raspberry mustard . the sandwiches are huge but
3 i will be the first to admit , we went here for lunch and this restaurant is probably more of a dinner stop . so , keep that in mind with this review . first and foremost , the food was excellent . my spinach ravioli with garlic creme sauce
4 in the heart of old town scottsdale , los olivos delivers mexican food with an old style flair . the decor is festive and the some of the waitstaff appear to have been working there forever . first of all , they serve two distinct salsas . i am not
3 this place has amazing deals ! they have happy hour daily from 3-5 pm and again from <unk> ! the lunch specials here are from <unk> . i love the # 5 sushi roll bento . it comes with soup , salad , spring roll , crab <unk> , california

4 i do n't know much more to say to add to the other <unk> reviews , but this place is pretty epic . my mom and i decided to try out a new joint for my birthday lunch and i found this place via my yelp iphone application -lrb- win
4 blue nile offers something for everyone . they offer raw foods during mondays while the entire week they offer dishes for vegan , vegetarian , and carnivores . the staff is very friendly , but some days the service can be a little slow which is quickly forgotten once you
4 if you wake up one morning and ponder about where to go to get <unk> <unk> , kangaroo , and/or quail then let me tell you my friend , posh is your place ! i made reservations to sit at the counter and i would highly suggest doing the same
2 i enjoy pf chang 's and usually come here for lunch for their yummy vegetarian wraps . yes , that is under their appetizer section , but i always get it for my meal and am always super satisfied after all my lettuce cups are gone . they do offer
4 the crab soup is to die for !
0 i used to be a regular here at gallo blanco , although i have to say this place has gotten a little <unk> ! we took our sister in law for her birthday and arranged for a table of six , we also asked the hostess if the outside tables
2 no frills here . they come take your order , it comes fast , it 's cheap , not much of an atmosphere . try the <unk> and chicken - it is a nicely crafted dish when they actually stir fry it , the other day they deep fried the
4 darn good coffee !
4 this place is great ! right when you walk in the door you get greeted by girls with smiling faces . i did n't bother looking at the menu because you could tell that everything about this place was fantastic . when they asked what i wanted for lunch ,
2 the food was good but not spectacular . the atmosphere and service was great . i love the bocce ball court is great . fun to play while enjoying a <unk> . i 'm very willing to give this place a 2nd chance .
3 you have to try this place . first time was a great time . i ca n't wait to go back . everything was very good and fresh .
2 when on a wed night and as the reviews said it was packed . i liked the laid back vibe the place gave and neat menu on <unk> , i tried the raspberry <unk> beer and it was excellent . the only think holding my experience back was the lack
3 i have heard great things about this place and it was nice to finally get there . the atmosphere was awesome . i went for a friends birthday so it was nice being able to show up dressed up and still feel comfortable when others were in casual clothes .
4 i must say that oregano 's is my second favorite restaurant , ever . no matter which one i go to im always pleased . i took my mom here for her birthday and service was great , staff was friendly . my waiter was a tad <unk> weird but
3 i went to this place when it first opened and i thought it was overrated . but i recently went back to meet a business client and it has changed ! the service was great , the food was excellent - now i know why it is always packed now
2 first time venturing into this new spot after a movie . it was about 10pm and were lookin for a snack and some drinks . was not packed as a normal spot is for a saturday . which was good . we walked in and there was not sign or
0 i say i will never return after waiting 1.5 hours to eat mediocre food , but i do it anyway , maybe it is me hoping that it will be better the next time i go . it was as disappointing as the last 8 times have been there !
2 made an 8:15 reservation on yelp for a late <unk> dinner with the mrs. last friday . wanted to check out cowboy <unk> , but then saw the reviews about cph and decided to give it a try . got there at 8pm and was greeted with a smile .
4 wonderful , welcoming service . my friend and i cam here for a girls night and just loved it . everything we ate was incredibly fresh and delicious - excellent pad thai and curry !! they make everything fresh to order , which translated to wonderful meals , but not
2 lovely , rich food , adorable atmosphere , spotty service and prices that are about a third more than they should be . if you 're trying to wow a date , or just have drinks , this is a great place . for dinner , for the money ,
3 wonderful warm welcome and delicious bagels ! my husband and i came in for the first time and i felt like we came over to a friend 's house . the owner offered to let us taste the bagels , made me a special order sandwich , and told us
3 always yummy thai food - pad thai , curries , kung pao , spicy eggplant - all delicious . the prices are reasonable , especially considering the generous portions . the service can be a bit on the slow side if you come at a busy time -lrb- noon ,
4 i 've been through a lot of airports and this one has some of the cleanest and most modern facilities , friendliest employees , shortest lines and nicest restaurants . clean , easy to navigate , lots of parking options , frequent <unk> from off site parking , and food
4 this place has been a favorite for a while - wonderful food and drinks for girls night happy hours and such . my husband and i chose to throw our <unk> dinner here and it was an incredibly positive experience !! first of all , the back patio is beautiful
1 looks like solid <unk> are the thing here . was seated quickly , order taken quickly and first round of drinks all appeared . going quite well . the garlic fries came out shortly after and that 's when it started to go from 4 stars <unk> . cajun pasta
4 after a couple of years going here i am upping it to a well deserved five . i realized this after being on a low <unk> diet for 2 weeks , eating nothing with salt , dairy , seafood or more than 6oz of meat a day , i waited
3 i think i have found the secret power source that <unk> the awesomeness that is captain bill 's . firstly this place has more bumper stickers than a vw <unk> convention , secondly the paint scheme could be a landing light for the white <unk> but i digress let 's
1 in context of eating prior to hockey . we 've usually avoided this location on game night since the 30-45 min waits rarely fit in with our <unk> saturday , <unk> , we made a deliberate attempt to get in , waited 30 mins . got in around <unk> ,
4 it 's not that the food is spectacular ; it 's only very good as a matter of fact . houston 's gets five stars because they consistently produce very good food along with impeccable service and a cool dark ambiance featuring great 60s ' jazz in the background .
1 decor : dark and depressing . the photos on their website are <unk> , so expect none of the fun colors and atmosphere . service : really slow ... i do n't care if you spend an hour making my first appetizer , you have to get a drink in
4 they have a great selection of superb beer . the service is always friendly and prompt . they have really good food that will blow you away considering the <unk> , micro brew setting .
2 i think the lady behind the counter did n't like me . could 've just been me . i do n't know . it 's just how i felt . when my boss first told me about this place , i thought he said `` al <unk> '' and i
1 the salsa they hand you with the chips tastes like , i do n't know , agent orange ? it does n't taste good . my tostada was swimming in a pool of grease . my enchilada was decent . the taco i had gave off an aftertaste that was
4 i ride my bike to work . today i was running a little bit later than i usually do . i had the slightest of hangovers , so getting out the door was a bit more delayed than is typical . i was riding my bike down scottsdale rd. .

3 their hours overall are kind of sucky . like , i do n't think they 're open on sunday . i love pizza on sunday . oh , how i do . sunday is my lazy day -lrb- i do n't do shit ! -rrb- , so having a nice
3 tempe farmer 's market is rad . their selection has grown immensely since today and when it had first opened . it 's not a one-stop , get all your groceries for the week kind of place , but it works <unk> as a neighborhood market with a few necessities
3 this all around one of my absolute favorite places to go whenever i have the energy to make it out there . it 's not far from where i live , but you have to understand , i 'm incredibly lazy . if i can get away with it ,
1 i saw a really great show here with my girlfriend and friend . the venue itself , i think , has too many bizarre rules and they are pretty disorganized . going to take a piss , i 'd just bought a beer and , hey , i kinda like

3 my daughter and i had a <unk> day last week . she had a dr. appointment and it would have been silly for me to drive all over trying to get back to work so i took the day off . we went to the mall and she spent gift
4 this is still a 5 star store . they have everything i need and then some . but i searched and searched for the sweet republic ice cream and , sadly , i did not see any . maybe they were all out ... i hope that was the case
2 i received a gift card to amc for my birthday so i decided to take my daughter to see <unk> last weekend . a $ 25 gift card bought our admission but did not cover a kids snack box , a medium popcorn and small drink . i have to

3 this is located in the same area as red seven computers so when i came to pick up my laptop i has already made up my mind that i was going to have lunch here . my friend vicky t. had tried this out and i know she has good
2 meh . i had an amc gift card so we went here on afternoon . it 's an older theater . the inside was fine , seating is good with high backs and all . the floor of the theater was sticky and that 's a pet peeve of mine
3 i will preface this by saying i did not go for dim sum , i went for dinner . saturday night and i did n't feel much like cooking so i checked yelp and found china king . when i pulled in the parking lot there were almost no cars
2 was a cool spot due to its support for <unk> athletic events and loved the location in scottsdale . would probably check out again .
3 i 'm far from any kind of casino expert , but this one i do enjoy . it truly has a little bit of everything for everyone . the casino itself is pretty large with a nice variety of slots and blackjack tables . a nice element is the bar
4 oh yeah , i 'm a fan . the bistro is definitely off the beaten path , we almost could n't find it . i 'm so glad we did . the chili relleno was very much to my liking . the sauce that covered my entree was spicy and
4 i like this place , alot . it 's classy , spacious , and the food is excellent . i did n't know what to expect when i decided on the bento box for lunch . everything was fresh and delicious . salmon , grilled asparagus , mixed green salad
4 yes , it 's as good as everyone says . both the shrimp and fish tacos were fresh and flavorful . they put a nice spin on the guacamole too . i 'm going back next week and can hardly wait .
3 i 've always looked forward to going to an original pancake house . this was my first visit to an oph outside of illinois . i ordered the spinach omelette with a side of bacon and of course pancakes . the omelette was supposed to have cheese in it ,
4 i 'm pissed that i shared my desserts with my husband . he did n't appreciate the freshness or the quality of the ingredients . this place is awesome ! next time i go , which will be next week , i 'm will not share . the lemon cupcake
4 amazing breakfast burritos ! heat up so well the next day , go here at least once a week !
3 great place for breakfast ! awesome combinations , friendly fast service ! omelet was super good and so were the pancakes . we will be back for sure !
4 great <unk> and fun place for families !!
3 this restaurant is great ! . mike , the celebrity look alike - lol , was amazing as our server . i had chicken pepper pizza and my fella had the lobster ravioli . <unk> had caprese salad and <unk> . all of the food was delicious and the service
4 <unk> 's charlie has nothing on me . we walked into a room where four scoops of gelato was only the beginning of this <unk> coma affair . we then walked into the back kitchen and there were 5 tables full of any sweet treats you can imagine . scones
4 what a fantastic dining experience from the very first impression to the last . the entire experience was just terrific . i had called earlier in the day to get directions and parking information . the woman on the phone was just so wonderful and friendly . i was happy
3 the food is delicious , the service was grand and very attentive , and the decor is delightful . it really is a pretty restaurant . they have the best churros with carmel dipping sauce . i ate a lot of them in spain and it is hard to find
3 i am reviewing sunday brunch at <unk> . lovely and outstanding ! james our server was a dear , the food was delish ! i wish i had more room for all those wonderful desserts , very unique menu , veal stroganoff . vanilla bean soaked infused fruit salad with
3 i was a little nervous reading the reviews about kids in bars which is not okay and not like one yelper wrote , `` innovative '' by the owners . hire a babysitter if you want to go out to a bar . a non <unk> play area in a
3 i used to go here years ago when it was a casual cheese steak sandwich shop . they sold the business 6 years ago and redecorated the place to a small intimate italian restaurant . the food is great . <unk> here are still delish ! service was good ,
4 mary beth from the museum contacted me this morning after reading this review in an attempt to make my experience better . i was most impressed by the call . i will update my review after we take the trip . i appreciated the reach out .
4 i finally went to lo-lo 's yesterday for a late lunch or early dinner . after dreaming and hearing about it for years we visited the new scottsdale location and were not disappointed . there was no wait . we did go off hours though . my guy tells me
2 ok a short and sweet review . a place to get stuffed for cheap . this place has slices for $ 2.50 for a piece of pizza that is actually half a pie . the pizza is n't the greatest but not the worse i ever have had . small
3 how in the world have i missed this place ? this place transplanted me right back to my ny roots . i can just see this place in queens right up to the timely , <unk> iron enclosed small patio area that opens up into a shady parking lot .
2 i have no idea how i lived here so long and have never eaten at this location . it seems <unk> . i even worked at the pointe when it was located at south mountain for many years and still never went to this phoenix staple . i was determined
3 i went in today <unk> to sell some cds for my landlord that a <unk> left behind . i was treated very well . -lrb- much better than the last time i was in -rrb- i also received an email in regards to my prior review from the store manager
3 despite having about as many restaurants per <unk> as is physically possible , old town offers up a pretty meager selection of wine bars -lrb- and good mexican food but that 's a topic for another time ! -rrb- . luckily , 5th and wine has upped the <unk> since
4 there 's a reason oregano 's has an hour wait on a regular monday night : awesomeness . luckily , it 's almost never as long of wait as they say , and you can always relax and enjoy a beer or cocktail while you wait . our last visit
2 eclectic or just `` off '' ? i really ca n't knock anything about the food , but i ca n't rave about it either . the decor is a combo of modern -lrb- think citizen 's public house -rrb- and one of the stores you find in old town
4 while harkins is my favorite movie theater chains . i like coming to this theater because they have the <unk> . <unk> is one of the biggest movie screens in phoenix . it is always fun waiting a new movie at harkins . most of the time i come here
4 if you have not been to trader joes then you are missing out . the reason why i say that is because everything at their store is awesome . first the employees are amazing . they are always asking you if you need help or just saying hi and welcome
4 i like coming to this amc on the weekends because the movies are only $ 5.50 before noon . it is pretty cool that we are normally the only ones in there . also the staff is always really nice and the theatres are really clean . : -rrb- if
4 last night we went to angel 's trumpet with our friends andrew s. and erin m . it is a cool new local restaurant and bar in downtown phoenix that opened a couple of months ago . they have a huge variety of draft beers and a great selection of
2 it is fun coming to studio movie grill . i like the concept of this movie theater where you can order food or drinks and watch a movie at the same time . the downside is that the staff is always walking around when someone needs a refill or wants
1 this was my first time here and will probably be my last time here too . i will admit that it was a cool place to go to and see the biggest organ in the world . the restaurant is two stories ; they only take cash or checks for
3 today i had the club sandwich for lunch and it was without a doubt one of the top five sandwiches of my lifetime . a club sandwich seems easy enough to master but lucky strike threw an egg on top and change the game . mind = blown . also
3 superb job by the copper blues staff during last night 's grand opening . the crowd was asses to elbows but we never waited terribly long for snacks or drinks . when you consider it was a hosted bar and the girls probably were n't making a ton of money
3 i saw `` the glass menagerie '' at herberger theater last night -lrb- <unk> -rrb- and not only was the play great but the herberger staff made the entire experience memorable . as a <unk> i appreciated the attention and thoughtful each <unk> received . i 'll definitely be back
2 i understand the comparisons to hooters -- cute gals serving up cold suds and wings to a mostly male crowd -- but the kilt has a much more sophisticated menu and <unk> draft beer list . some of the downtown girls are a little green -- this location just opened
3 viet kitchen opened a second location at <unk> w. adams st. in downtown phoenix -lrb- tucked between downtown dining <unk> the hero factory and z pizza -rrb- today and it was packed ! while i kept it light with the spring rolls -- extremely fresh and they use the clear

3 best breakfast in town ! but enough about the food , i 'm writing to <unk> you with <unk> of my <unk> with the <unk> servers i 've ever seen . i do n't what exactly it is , but whomever does the hiring at this joint deserves a firm
3 great lunch buffet ... for some odd reason when i wake up hungover the only thing i want is plate after plate of indian food . they have the usual assortment of curry dishes , vegetables , and bbq 'd meats , as well as sauces for the naan .
3 i am so happy this place just opened ! chances are if you 're a fan of great sports bars you 've been to one of their other locations , but this new location on indian school is one to go out of the way for . after entering ,
1 one word best describes this place : overpriced . i had the miso soup , the seafood yaki soba , mint lemonade , and shrimp tempura , and our table split a lotus on fire roll . the lotus on fire roll was great . spicy and tasty . ca
3 there are a lot of pizza joints in the valley , and reading the reviews of each one , you 'd think they all serve the best pizza in town . the parlor is no exception . i did n't think the parlor would be the best in town ,
4 i will admit , i have always been a <unk> . the moment someone labels something `` best -lrb- whatever -rrb- in -lrb- wherever -rrb- ! '' my immediate reaction is to think there is a giant media <unk> <unk> to trick all the <unk> <unk> into thinking they 're
4 my favorite restaurant in gilbert . this is my kind of bbq . i 'm a huge fan of pulled pork , and their pulled pork is perfect . i like the pulled pork so much that i have n't been able to try any of their other meat selections
2 the first time i walked in here , it was crowded . not wanting to wait for a table , i decided to simply get a sonora burger to go . it was decent ; the <unk> patty was unique and kept the meat nice and moist . i recently
3 now this is good caribbean food . we wandered in a little after noon , and the place was empty ... four tables , and the nice lady who runs the place . i could tell right away that this was going to be authentic . i ordered the curry
4 beaver choice is an excellent place which i have had the chance to visit three or four times . this is about as home-cooked as you can get in a restaurant . it 's like eating at mom 's house , if mom happens to be swedish . i 've
1 i 've been here three or four times now , and i figured it 's about time i review this place . first of all , the only reason i ever come here -lrb- after the first trip , of course -rrb- is because someone else is buying . because

3 i 'd keep going back just for the sweet potato chips and the patio dining . it 's a perfect place for lunch . two can share many of the menu items . we loved the pear and gorgonzola flatbread . the service and the orange blossom iced tea helped
2 tapas papa frita is a good place for tapas . location and decor is great , you 'll like the patio , the ambience , the service . we 've tried it twice , once by ourselves for lunch and once with a party of eight for dinner . there
3 four of us went there for dinner on <unk> . it is newly opened and the atmosphere is elegant and spacious . the menu runs closer to <unk> rather than mexican/american . among us we had the pork tamale , the chicken & mushroom quesadilla , the guacamole , the

4 considering the lack of dive bars left in downtown phoenix , the bikini gets 5 stars , otherwise it would get 4 . we started going there about 6 years ago when we lived in the <unk> story district . we love dive bars , and the best time to
4 wow . i 've been reading the other reviews and i 'm honestly shocked . i 've been coming here since it first opened and no one knew anything about it . i liked it better when it was small and unknown , but that 's because i could enjoy

3 awesome wings ! they 're big and meaty , cooked to our <unk> of crispy and with a really good <unk> sauce . actually i do n't think i 've ever had a bad meal at seamus 's . it 's not fancy , it 's just a bar with
3 went here to have lunch and they serve such a great selection of appetizers that we order off that menu and shared ! good food , well prepared and pretty good service for a very busy sunday afternoon . they have a good mix of food with a fresh sushi
2 this is a great place to eat `` except '' they are hit and miss with food quality and level of service . on occasion when my wife and i stop on for lunch , there always manages to be some issue with the food in one another 's meal
2 great great food , but go to the bank first and check you account balance cause the prices are ridiculous . guacamole is very different but in a good way . appetizers are amazing . main dishes , although flavorful , are incredibly expensive . their version of carne '
3 this is a really great theater for a mall . with each theater they all have their different attributes and pluses and minuses . this is a clean theater and close to parking and other restaurants . what i like the most is that there are other eats and activities

3 found this place as we were driving by wondering what we felt like for lunch . glad we stopped because this place is a keeper . the staff is legit , service is decent considering how busy it was during the lunch rush and the food is just amazing .
3 perk eatery definitely has its perks . it 's convenient and easy to spot , large enough so that a wait on a sunday morning is n't bad at all and has outdoor tables for enjoying a leisurely sunday brunch day . plus , they had some pumpkin pancakes that

2 not bad for taiwan food . the dumplings were pretty good though . the service could have being better ... they need to work on customer service . the eggplant and tofu dish was interesting . the seafood pancake was n't that impressive . hey ... i was very hungry

2 i think we ordered the wrong items . i had a slice of sicilian pizza , my date had the spaghetti , and we split a salad . salad was just ok , pizza and pasta were decent but nothing to get super excited about . if i lived next
3 this place is a hidden gem in the city of glendale . it 's in a grungy strip mall that most people would not stop or give a second look at . but , once you step in , the restaurant gives off a nice ambiance . the food is

4 organic and tasty . went there for my daughter 's going away event . they were so sweet and gave us the big room .

3 this location usually has a wait during peak hours , but that is because it 's tasty and worth the wait . i have never had anything that i did n't like . i have tried the pablo picasso mexican salad , which has a really nice chipotle dressing .
3 i have been to butters twice , and thought it was great both times ! i have been for lunch , and had the turkey burger with sweet potatoes fries , and for breakfast , where i had an omelette and pancakes . both meals were really tasty . the
1 not what i expected . the food was nothing special , especially compared to other fox restaurants . the restaurant itself is a nice place to go with a group of people . the margaritas and mojitos were alright , but there are definitely places to find better in the
1 perhaps and it is very possible i do not understand the concept of restaurant week . it seemed it was or is to attract potential customers with less than average prices for above average food and service , you know so we will come back when we feel like spending
3 have been several times over the years and have found each visit a nice comfortable place to get a decent meal . good service , good food and right price .

1 not much needs to be said about a bar devoted to being <unk> . the various signs with catch phrases and college <unk> attest to this . `` i like your pants . especially on my floor , '' says it all . perhaps a devoted patron of this bar

1 i really like the atmosphere of the vig uptown , i just wish i could say the same for the food . it 's just not vegetarian friendly . yes , they have a greasy vegetable sandwich , and yes , they can <unk> many menu items to be vegetarian
3 so this place was pretty neat . we met my folks there for lunch on saturday . i am a huge fan of le grande orange , so when they suggested it , i was pretty stoked to try it . the restaurant itself has a modern yet organic feel
3 with a `` <unk> '' here and a `` <unk> '' there ... everywhere a `` <unk> '' ! sorry that was the first thing that came to mind when i was asked to go to the farm for lunch . as first timers , we were a little confused

1 let me start by saying , as a vegetarian flemings is not the most exciting dining selection , but i decided to give it a try for the sake of my bf and he 's carnivorous appetite . as good guests do , we called ahead and made reservations .
3 i always have good time at this place . i could write a page about geisha , but the previous reviews pretty much sum this place up . * self <unk> bathrooms -lrb- ladies only -rrb- * fantastic happy hour pricing - the veggie pot stickers are the bomb !
0 i hate to break it to you all ... but the long awaiting delivery of an h & m store in scottsdale , turned out to be a huge disappointment ! ever hear the saying `` good from far , but far from good '' ? this pretty much sums

3 not much to say here , but if you have n't tried oregano 's yet ... stop what you 're doing and go now ! they have a huge menu with tons of tasty stuff to choose from . we almost always split a large whole wheat thin crust pizza

3 bourbon steak is an excellent restaurant . yes it 's on expensive but that 's to be expected . the only thing i had a problem with was the service 2 out of the 4 times i have been there . they need to have better management in my opinion
3 a decent place to watch the game and other sports . the service is not the best there but you are not going there for the best service . this is what i call a <unk> . the food is pretty good nice portions for the price . the staff
3 this is a great neighborhood spot for some traditional sonoran mexican food . i usually get the blackened chicken or shrimp burrito and it is always very consistent and good . they make all their own salsas and they are very good . the habanero sauce is their hottest and
3 good food at a decent price . only problem when i come here is it seems i am the only customer so not much on ambiance or social scene .
2 it is a nice large airport with many amenities while waiting for your flight or to pick someone up
3 classic scottsdale dive bar . this place has been here for 30 plus years and is a great spot in downtown scottsdale . very chill and very inexpensive for all drinks .
3 i have only been to black bear diner for the breakfast and the food is fantastic ! lots of great tasting food for a low price !
1 finally went to postinos after many people telling me how good it is . i went in with high exceptions and i was let down . our food was overpriced and honestly not that good . we ate on the patio and the misters were leaking on us , my

3 best kept secret for breakfast in old town . i ordered the open faced breakfast sandwich and was so happy ! it comes on a creamy texas toast base with your choice of prepared egg , bacon and a side of hash browns . i went over-easy on the egg
2 nothing special but good for watching a game outside and grabbing a beer with buddies . the people watching has never been that good here . in fact , it 's more of a boring vibe . the food is n't bad .

4 i really love this new location . it look cute and feel like i got lose into france . my favorite are chocolate croissant and black forest cake .
4 the best crepe in town !!! even though the sign on the door does not make sense but i still gave 5 stars . the sign told us to get to the door to get the table . we were in front of the door and <unk> help us .
4 if you 're looking for fresh seafood , great ambiance , & exceptional service you need to check out mastro 's ocean club . their seafood is flown in fresh daily . if you order a martini , you not only get a full martini glass , but a half

3 as a self proclaimed beer aficionado , this place has pretty good selection of bottle beers , ranging from microbrews from the states and more harder to get european beers . their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place . as far as the bar offerings

1 i have eaten lunch here -lrb- sandwich , chips , obligatory pickle -rrb- , but i am specifically yelping about the bakery . i purchased a `` holly <unk> '' cake for my mother to celebrate mother 's day , and was really disappointed . the price is steep -lrb-
4 i am a total sucker for quaint bungalow style homes . -lrb- i used to own one , a sears bungalow , <unk> . -rrb- so this adorable bar/lounge had me as soon as i walked onto the <unk> porch and into the front door . i could smell the
2 wow , what a relief . i am so glad to see an average yelp rating of 3 stars . i was worried that i was crazy because when i arrived , i read multiple `` best of ... '' awards -lrb- you know the ones -rrb- , but by
4 i love this place ! love , love , love ...
1 i have not returned yet -lrb- although i expect to soon as i have a planned event at press next week -rrb- , but i think it is fair to share that the owner contacted me regarding my review . he was , of course , in his words ,
2 i really , really , really want to give this restaurant five stars , however , at the end of the evening , i became sick ... you know ... <unk> food type sick . i did love the experience in the restaurant , however . -lrb- not to be
3 yes , the staff is amazing : very <unk> , very friendly , and the general manager , tracy , stopped several times to chat with us . the tots are amazing , but when i complained to tracy that they must have been cooked in the same oil as
3 i love this little restaurant . a friend suggested it to me , and i have been recommending it to others ever since . it is absolutely charming , the food is good -lrb- and a fair helping at a fair price -rrb- , and the waitstaff was both efficient
3 i know i may be <unk> by my fellow yelpers but ... i have not been impressed by breakfast here . i 've been here three times now , and the breakfast has been sub-par each time . in all honesty , i have not been here for lunch or
3 just go here , now . i really mean it ... go . real scandinavian folk , homemade and insanely good food . be prepared to wait a bit for your food . each dish is made to order so enjoy some good conversation in the mean time .
3 above average pho . the chicken they use is kind of <unk> and nasty in my opinion . establishment is super nice and clean . awesome atmosphere without a doubt . big bonus : lots of hot vietnamese women working in the kitchen .
3 good selection of sandwiches for a great price . the bread was very fresh and scrumptious . they also have the best <unk> ! the place was huge and clean . i will be going back for more for sure .
4 the person above with ` duplicate review ' has a link to a different restaurant . this is hana japanese eatery on 7th st. corkage , byob ! this is my favorite <unk> restaurant in town right now . unfortunately they do not serve alcohol , but you can bring
1 average sushi here , pretty good lunch specials . nothing to write home about but if you are hungry and in the area , its a decent meal . prices are mid to high for sushi . come in , eat , get out ...
4 marcellino and <unk> are finally back after their yearly 1 month italy vacation -lrb- re-opened september 10th -rrb- ... and are we glad they are back ! we had a fabulous duo appetizer : fresh fig and prosciutto and the second was a filet -lrb- carpaccio -rrb- with shaved mushroom
4 what a pleasant surprise this was . we had ventured to this part of tempe to finally visit the crepe bar , but sadly it was closed for the holidays - so this was the closest joint with solid reviews & we went for it . instantly wary when you
1 so , i 've been to whole foods before - and it 's always a visual treat . great selection , fresh , natural foods , lots of beautiful & healthy soccer moms <unk> about - but last night was the 1st time i visited their watering hole . immediately
1 sadly , i think this place is suffering from `` i do n't know what i want to be '' <unk> . in the past , we 've gone for the happy / reverse happy hour and had great experiences . but , saturday , unfortunately , it was just
3 do n't let the <unk> exterior -lrb- with the exception of the amazing mural -rrb- fool you at this joint ... it 's much bigger than it looks from the outside . the only food i tried was their margherita pizza , which was fresh and tasty - but far
4 ok , i 've been to this place probably ten times . and most of the choices we 're so-so ... but recently , i was introduced to their orange <unk> . it has two levels of deliciousness , and every time i try one it blows my mind .
1 so the place has christmas lights , and a fair amount of ambiance , and supposedly there 's a <unk> shot at 1:00 - which might make going back worth it . other than that , the service was less than lackluster , the domestic kegs all seemed flat .
2 had a lunch date here ... i had the grilled swordfish tacos and i forgot what he had ... i think the grilled ahi tuna . portions were on the smaller size for the price -lrb- yes even for lunch -rrb- . i kind of felt bad , because i
3 i thought grayhawk golf club had good sliders ... this place takes the prize . they are true angus beef baby ! nice bar and outdoor patio area . watched the ncaa playoffs their -lrb- <unk> -rrb- ... great spot ... not too crowded mixed with good company ... just
3 went to cg again tonight and definitely redeemed itself . had the lobster bisque soup for <unk> and shared the sliced filet mignon with <unk> onions and wild mushrooms with my girlfriend and was definitely very happy with this selection . the fresh warm hot rolls were exceptional as well
3 most people know houston 's . its a good standby . the service is always great and i love how the servers work as a team . houston 's has fantastic burgers if you did n't know . tip : they serve a strawberry shortcake for dessert in the summer
2 pretty darn good ! had the vegetarian combo . the <unk> was super <unk> ' ! but the hummus and baba ganoush were a little bland to me . so disappointing ! next time , i 'll have what my friends had ... a good old fashioned gyro ! oh
4 windsor is like postino and vig had a baby ! of course we had to start with the corn dog bites . i love these little nuggets of state fair gold . there were a few pieces of friend pickle chips in the basket -lrb- on purpose -rrb- ... nice
3 i love this sexy , modern chic restaurant with the equally inviting menu . everything from the <unk> walls , cool-looking servers and the interesting play on classic american food is wonderful ! the happy hour mon-fri from <unk> is great ! unlike some happy hour menus where they serve
3 the happy hour was better than i expected ! love this place .
0 been there for lunch a couple of times . the first time i was not impressed , and rather neutral about the experience . but i thought it was because i was on the phone w / biz the entire time . went last week w / a few folks
3 the lamb kisra -lrb- basically a pizza or flatbread -rrb- is soooooooo damn good ! the salad selection will make even the most focused foodie indecisive . not because there are too many selections , but b/c they 're all so interestingly delish ! the atmoshpere is super cool and
3 i love pita jungle 's food -lrb- service is another story -rrb- !! never had a bad meal . and what i love most of all is the lemon dressing they use on the greek salad . it 's soooo light and refreshing . the only thing i do n't
3 `` surprisingly good '' as one reviewer wrote ! so true ! odd looking place when you first walk in . menu is odd too and looks like a newspaper . but odd in a good way . all i can say is ... the rellenos are so so sinful
1 as usual , the collard greens were hit or miss . and this time was another `` miss '' . <unk> too peppery ! also as usual , the side dishes for one of the guests in my party did n't come out until after three requests for them ...
3 went to defalco 's for lunch recently and was instantly consumed by the smell of fresh bread , garlic and sauces . like walking into an italian grandmother 's kitchen . <unk> . the deli case stocked full of salami , pastrami and every other - <unk> you can imagine
3 atlas is a place for the foodies , the <unk> , folks with a trained palate and the adventurous . not your place if you need buffalo wings , burgers and fries or a grilled chicken salad . like their website states : `` organic , hand <unk> , local
3 i first went to crust over 5 years ago and the food has always been fairly good . after the disaster that was the street eats festival today , i was happy to go eat lunch at crust instead . i went with the bf and another couple -lrb- erin
3 my whole family went here last night for my oldest brother 's birthday . this restaurant was very accommodating to our large party . they even sat us before everyone was there , and we appreciated that . we ordered a bunch of food , a couple pizzas , a
3 i went here for linner today as i had a groupon -lrb- yay for using up my groupons ! -rrb- . the bf and i got there around 3 <unk> so the place was n't so busy , there were still a few tables in there , though . they
3 i went back here last night with my mom as last time we went my mom asked for half of her burger in a doggie bag and when she got home it was n't in the bag , so my mom called and talked with chris who is the manager
2 the food here is alright , however , the service is not very good . i went on a thursday night and it was pretty busy . i sat outside because that was the only area with open seating . unfortunately i sat right by some people smoking -lrb- not
2 let me start by saying that this is a <unk> review ... i have a groupon for dinner here , so i will definitely be trying it again and will update then . ok , so yesterday the bf and i went here for breakfast to celebrate my graduation and
3 # 100 for 2013 ! woot ! anyway , i went to solo for my birthday dinner with my mom and it was very good ! we shared the funghi pizza and the pasta with the <unk> pesto . the pizza was great , it was fresh and earthy .
2 let me start by giving this place some props . the first time i tried oink was at the new times phoenix a ` fare and i had their bacon donut ... and it was amazing ! so fast forward to a couple weeks ago , the bf and i
2 i went to poncho 's today for lunch with the bf and it was ok . the place was very busy , so i thought that was a good sign . we waited for a bit before being seated in one of the small rooms in the back . we
3 i must be a sucker for wine bars ... they are just so good ! i went to timo after finding it on yelp while hiking north mountain with my step mom deb . we were hiking and , of course , thinking about food ... lol . so we
1 this was definitely a meh experience ... although i guess that should have been expected . i built my own burger with a wheat bun , cheddar , lettuce , haystack onion , ketchup and mustard . it was greasy and underwhelming . all i could taste was the mustard
3 i really like the cracker barrel for breakfast , mainly because it holds a lot of people so there 's never a really long wait and it 's cheap . like dirt cheap . you can not go out to breakfast for less except maybe at the waffle house .
3 um ... yes please ! this is one of those cases where the <unk> ` you ca n't judge a book by its cover ' really applies . this place looks awful from the outside ... like a place you would never want to go , but do not be
1 what happened flo 's ? i have been coming to flo 's for many years , even had my sister in law 's baby shower there -lrb- which was great and affordable ! -rrb- . i was in the shopping center today and decided to pick up some of their
2 i went here for lunch today and it was a solid three star , but has the potential to be a 4-5 star place . the place was pretty empty at lunch and my friend and i were seated right away . we ordered a bunch of things to share
1 claim jumper is one of those chain restaurants that gives you giant portion sizes , but the food really is n't anything to rave about . i went here with a few friends last saturday after we had our comprehensive exam and it was just alright . i really wanted
4 this has got to be the best chinese in phoenix . the food is always fast and fresh . the servers are always attentive and friendly . this place is just great to go to . i normally get the chicken chow mein and my bf gets the sweet and
4 this place reminds me of seattle . the coffee is very good and the decor is nice and feels like a ` real ' coffee house , not a starbucks -lrb- ugh -rrb- . i also like how it looks like it is going to be so small from the
3 i went here today for lunch with my dad , my brother , niece , nephew , and their cousin . there were some definite pros and cons to this restaurant . pros : good caesar salad cute kid 's menu , little wax toys for them to play with
3 yay ! nypd is some pretty good stuff . i 've been going to nypd since i was a kid , but the one in scottsdale . so now that i live on the east side , i go to this nypd . i had a coupon for a free
1 i went to the daily dose today for breakfast and honestly did n't think much of it . i got the egg sandwich on a bagel and it was one of the most boring least delicious egg sandwiches i have ever had . anyone who knows me knows that i
3 mmmmm ice cream sandwich . this dessert is really great because it 's really two desserts . i like that ... a lot . so i went here this afternoon for ` dinner ' and got the vietnamese coffee ice cream between two chocolate chip cookies ... so good .
2 i still think that this place is a glorified cheesecake factory -lrb- because it is -rrb- but i have been here a few times since my last review and must say that a lot of their food really is tasty -lrb- much tastier than cheesecake factory -rrb- , so i
3 ok , as much as i want to give this place 5 stars ... i just ca n't . the wait is just too ridiculous . so i think this place plays <unk> tricks on it 's patrons . people have to wait so long that they either go get
2 i went to this location of in n out last night <unk> about 1:30 am . yes , i had had some beverages . that alone should have made this experience extra delicious ... but it was n't . there was a long line , understandable . when we got
2 ok . so i went to the boa bistro a few months back and thought it was really not so good , but my dad wanted to go to caffe boa today and insisted that it was good , so i begrudgingly agreed . we got there at lunch time
2 i went to this bar last night with some friends and it was alright . we got there early , like around 9 , and got a table on the patio . the drinks were decent , and my friends ' drinks were really cheap -lrb- it was extended happy
3 this place is pretty tasty ... i went here tonight with the bf and another couple after wanting to go for months . . months ! and it still did n't disappoint , so that 's how you know it 's good . we started with some drinks , i
3 update : chef chris is awesome . he not only sent me a message late last night , but he called me this morning to personally apologize , talk with me about the experience , and insist i take a refund -lrb- which i did not want to take because
2 my mom and i decided to have a girls day today , starting with massages and ending with indian food on a whim . my mom said that she hated indian food , but then it came out that the last time she had had it was 20 years ago
2 i came here twice in the last few weeks , the first just for drinks and the second for drinks and happy hour food . the drinks here are solid and happy hour is good . their marg was pretty standard , but at only 4 $ on special ,
3 i went here last weekend with the bf 's parents to see if we would like to have our rehearsal dinner here . when we first walked in , i was n't 100 % convinced because this place is old school ... like what i remember a sizzler or something
3 i 've been to tammie coe a couple times as i live fairly close to this location . they have some pretty delish baked goods ... i 've tried the crack cake -lrb- chocolate and mocha deliciousness -rrb- , red velvet cupcake -lrb- cream cheesy frosting of <unk> ... but
4 the bf and i went back here last night because he felt like a burger and it was 9 o clock and we did n't want fast food , so this place came to mind , despite the fact that it is far away from home . i was so
2 i went here the other day with some friends for lunch . i got the chicken teriyaki bento box , which was actually a great deal . for 8 $ i got miso soup , salad , spring roll , one gyoza , rice , chicken , and veggies .
4 since my previous review i have been to short leash several times and each time it is just wonderful ! i recommend trying their specials from week to week ... they are often way better than their standard menu items . the food here is great , but the more
3 i went to rehab tonight to celebrate my last day of work for the school year ! also , we had a yelp deal ... so that was cool too . the atmosphere is very casual , that i like . i got a frozen margarita and oh my goodness
4 wow . just wow . why have n't i gone to this place before now ? am i crazy ? so i went there last night for my birthday with the bf and it was wonderful ! we got there at around 9 due to my having class until late
3 this place was hopping at lunch time last friday ! the restaurant is really nice looking , with a lot of natural sunlight . i went with my dad and we split the chicken flat bread and the braised beef sandwich with the quinoa side salad . it was a
3 the bf and i decided to try something new and different for breakfast yesterday and as i looked on the yelp app , this place came up . the bf was a little skeptical of going to vegetarian/vegan restaurant , but i convinced him because , generally , breakfast is
2 i went to pig and pickle tonight for one reason ... to get the veggie burger with bacon ... did i get that ? nope ... when the bf and i got there , we realized it was happy hour and i could not resist 5 $ plates . we
3 i only got one thing here while at the airport this past christmas ... . the red velvet cupcake . and it was sooooo <unk> . decadent . cream cheesy . <unk> . i want another red velvet cupcake right now * drool . the place is set up very
0 simply awful . we had heard a few people rave about this place , and now i wonder if they were dropped as a baby or how they got this brain damage . the `` cheese '' is this awful <unk> grease product with yellow color . that was the
3 had a really great lunch here . the place was really busy , but service was still pretty fast . the food portions are gigantic and you ca n't leave this place hungry . prices are in line with the quality and huge portions . the fried chicken is excellent
4 this place was just fantastic all around . the service was fast and very friendly . we chatted with the baristas and servers for a bit , and they really know their coffee and products . i had a double macchiato that was prepared perfectly , and the coffee was
3 good quality , tasty , and generous portions .
3 we went here for dinner tonight because it was arizona restaurant week and they had a special menu . they were offering an appetizer , entree , and dessert for $ 29 a person . unlike other restaurants , the items on this special menu were some of the same
1 seeing all the cars parked in their parking lot and as it was time for lunch , i decided to give it a try . the staff was very efficient . i think i waited a whole 10 minutes to get my food . i ordered the mongolian beef .
2 i 've downgraded ted 's unfortunately . in the many times i have gone back , when i have had the footlong , every time i 've been disappointed . i remember it tasting better . i think it just tastes funky . i do n't know if they do
4 i ran in here to get some jasmine rice , beef pho seasoning and a refill of <unk> <unk> de coco yesterday . i was disappointed to discover that they only had coconut flavored <unk> , no mango or strawberry ones but that 's okay , my toddler devoured them
4 i brought my six year old son and 20 month old daughter here for a , much needed , sugary pick me up after i took them to the phoenix art museum and we had a great time . the place was still sporting christmas dcor in their traditional pink
3 our family loves 5 & diner . i have two little boys who are 5 and 7 and they get so excited to go to 5 & diner and put quarters in the miniature jukebox at the table and wear the paper 5 & diner caps they get with their
4 this place is a jam packed , hardcore candy warehouse . it 's not <unk> and it does n't have playful little candy displays , but they have almost any candy you can imagine or remember from your days past . racks , bins and shelves stacked with <unk> ,
3 this is my gym . it 's expensive as hell , but worth it . the workout and water facilities are top notch and they have several of everything , so there really is n't any wait , but what really sets lifetime apart in my book is the locker
3 i did it , i broke my <unk> vow ... i braved the <unk> yuppies and the tanned and <unk> mommies in $ 100 lulu lemon yoga pants who 've never broken a genuine sweat in their lives -lrb- <unk> yoga does n't count , bitches ! -rrb- and i
4 i came here again for groceries with my teenage daughter this weekend since i received a $ 10 off of a $ 50 purchase coupon in the mail . -lrb- yes ! -rrb- it 's a bit of a drive for me to get up here since i live <unk>
0 dear tempe marketplace , this is the most <unk> place i can think of in my immediate vicinity . if i ever commit suicide , it will be here . you really are an easy target , are n't you ? your `` authentic '' restaurants of every variety are
4 five stars . why ? because it 's damn near impossible to get a decent espresso pull in tempe , and this place does it . plus , it 's close to my house -lrb- in phoenix terms , at least -rrb- and to me , that counts for a
4 an asian grocery the size of a wal-mart is pretty awe-inspiring all by itself , but there 's really much , much more to lee lee than aisles of noodles and spices and lentils and <unk> -lrb- though they do have these as well , in spades , as well
4 probably the best 500 calorie salad i have ever had ... the bbq chicken salad is an <unk> how they make this salad for only <unk> calories is insane . . i will be eating this salad four times a week , my wifes quail was so rich with the
4 local , unpretentious , clean , friendly , reasonable prices . . always fast , friendly efficient service , the pasta here makes you wonder how olive garden stays in business . . -lrb- the crack infused into the bread sticks . . -rrb- great seafood dishes for under 15
4 our own little version of the <unk> in north phoenix . the quality of the exhibits and the amount of different instruments mim has is daunting . this is one of the most impressive collections of music anything i have ever scene . a must for anyone who appreciates music
3 love the original los dos ! they have solid food and good service . this place is always very busy and noisy inside the restaurant . definitely not a place for a quiet dinner out . i make it here a couple times a year and it is always fantastic
4 love it ! the espresso is great and i love that i can get almond milk lattes ! sometimes they have vegan gluten-free desserts , which is an added bonus . this place is always crowded , but that is just part of the deal . highly recommended !
3 so the awesome food truck came to a fixed abode at the old cheuvront location . i am in heaven - no longer have to wander around the valley trying to remember what <unk> they 're supposed to be where . and it 's only a few blocks from home
3 we got christmas dinner here for an excellent price ; the mashed potatoes were delicious , the cranberry whatever was very good , turkey <unk> serviceable and allowed me to make my own gravy . why are <unk> prepared <unk> always so horrid ? otherwise , i 've taken to
4 the only thing wrong with this place is : no dessert menu . o wait ... that 's next door ...
3 four for dinner on a first friday - this is the third restaurant in a building with three and the only one not on the street - it shows . sens and turf had people spilling out of them - pasta bar was half full at best - an <unk>
3 i am horrified it took me so long to review this - it took me a few months to track down chris porter 's new place last year . having found it , i took my wife there for her birthday in early january , 2010 . not the extravaganza
4 ... as always , 5 stars if the place would stand up anywhere . it would . firstly , i 'm overjoyed it survived these past few years . secondly , on a regular saturday night 8:30 - ish , it was 40 % full - and <unk> with it
1 i went for lunch on a weekend recently . kimchi pancakes , spicy pork bbq lunch special . the seasoning on the pork bbq was n't what it used to be . it seems like the texture is dried out and the flavor is bland . the sauce is probably
1 nice <unk> . i like sitting outside near the fireplace on the sofas during the winter and read books . the kids go <unk> @ the <unk> water fountains , which is pretty annoying sometimes . not a huge variety of stores . i got my wallet stolen at this
3 pretty darn good pork bbq sandwich . good service . laid back fun atmosphere . i went for a late dinner on a weekday night . was spacey , not crowded at all , and food was relatively quick . parking is kinda tricky to figure out at first
3 i went here for a buddy 's bday party . the sandwich one of us ordered was huge . the clam chowder was kind of small but very fresh and tasty . sirloin steak was small but decent . mashed potatos were yummy . so were the veggies . food
2 good outdoor mall when the weather is nice . i go here for ra happy hour sometimes . however , i found a huge roach chilling near the fountain area on the stone step / bench area . well , duh its an outdoor mall ... but still , i
1 i had better . takes way too long , and this place went downhill in quality and service over the last 3 years .
3 really hit or miss . one day there was nothing but crap , another day , i found a gorgeous formal gown with some <unk> and <unk> flaws for 11 bucks ! i fixed it up and <unk> it for 30 bucks and now its a top tier prom gown
4 we use bertha 's at work for lunch catering and they are always on time , affordable and delicious . i always make sure to order myself an additional <unk> combo when they deliver . so to start , bertha 's is fantastic . some of my favorite sandwiches :
2 i really want to give <unk> 4 stars , but it 's just not a 4-star pizzeria . their veggie pizza is the best out of any ` delivery ' i 've had but does n't rival cibo or even sauce . the upside : good veggie/vegan options . -
4 i was so excited for green to finally open a location -- right across the street from my house . everything i 've tried , i loved . their `` burgers '' are delish -lrb- try the <unk> , green burger , spicy ` g ' -rrb- , the <unk>
4 this is my favorite new place in the <unk> phoenix area . everything about the ambiance is rad . this place gets packed on most evenings , so you may expect a wait time . their veggie board is ridiculously good . it would be a great meal on its
0 i do n't know how much worse this place can be . i tried the happy valley location with an awful experience a year ago and decided to give mellow mushroom another chance when they had a groupon . bad idea . the first incident of this meal was getting
3 i love video games and we had a d & b card that we purchased in hawaii while on our honeymoon . we decided to see how much was left on the card and kill some time this afternoon . turns out we had like 20 bucks left on it
4 still the greatest pizza out here in the west ! my wife and i got a small garden salad , and our usual ... a large pepperoni and garlic pizza . she had a glass of their new sangria and i had a pepsi . total after tip was about
3 i forgot to review my birthday lunch ... . damn it anyways ! i wanted to try some of mr. biancos offerings but did not want to wait 3 hours for pizza so we decided to come here . i figured it would be my only trip here in quite
4 still my favorite hot dogs . we started the trip and ended the trip with meals at teds . first visit - got there about 2pm on saturday afternoon . i have never seen a line of more than 5-7 people here at teds . we walked in and there
3 even after reading the reviews , i was still surprised by how nice the decor , how warm the service and how fucking delicious the lentil soup really is ! needing sustenance fast , i had an <unk> friend that knew his babaganoush and his hummus and i had some
3 <unk> and <unk> through porn and graphic novels at <unk> , <unk> and <unk> over forever 21 plaid <unk> , <unk> deeply the <unk> and giant cookie pizzas that say i heart u , and singing along to hole in hot topic ... is this <unk> in <unk> , nj
1 one star for : the company -lrb- meaning , my friends , not the elusive firm in the firm with tom `` <unk> '' cruise -rrb- one star for : the cool fish in the fishtank lauren and i enjoyed . if i could <unk> six down the toilet ,
2 this is a local arizona institution , so i am scared to give it 3 stars ... but dammit , this site is about honesty , right ? my brother has tried to take me to an oregano 's for a while , but there is always an insane wait
2 3 and a half stars i really like the large patio in the <unk> an older and not as rowdy in the annoying <unk> screaming for no <unk> reason , but more bustling like friends come here to chill the fuck out . the way a good pub should be
4 so after experiencing a <unk> moment at chez <unk> , any bar was going to have a hard competing with `` smooth <unk> '' lounge singers ... but this place was def . a ` good egg ' . easy enough to find with the rude boy sign on east
3 i had heard through many <unk> that the people loved my florist , and a quite bit were vegetarians and they would say , `` bonnie , you would love it '' . after a long day walking around with my honey in phoenix , we wanted a nice ,
3 god , you really ca n't beat the soy mocha here -lrb- i mean , i like lux a lot , but lux is in phoenix , i am here in tempe -rrb- . i just wish they had two baristas cause that line gets really long sometimes . i
2 what if you could walk down a hallway into your favourite liquor store , only to find a warm cave with chimay on tap and big screen television sets ? what if i told you it was taste of tops ? located next to thai basil and an antique shop
3 you have $ 20 , it is a beautiful day in phoenix , it is 11:30 and you want brunch ? coronado cafe ? yes . a lazy saturday morning where palatte , over easy and matt 's big breakfast had been <unk> led us to this charming renovated house
3 a final stop for last call after enjoying a late night tapas , i was surprised by how small this place is compared to the other <unk> in oversized spaces arizona . i found it instantly comforting instead of cramped quickly . you have a hostess area right when you
3 disclaimer : i 've known steve -lrb- the owner -rrb- for a few years and he 's a great guy . disclaimer : i 'm also a coffee dork and even though i know steve and he 's a great guy i would n't pull punches if the place was
4 since moving nearby to la grande orange , i 've <unk> the amount of money i 've spent at that most tasty place . now that i 've finally made it to postino , my <unk> will only grow . yeah , it 's wonderful . <unk> greeted me at
4 they say love hurts . i love fnb , and the place hurts me . trying it on the recommendation of many friends , we snuck into the counter on late notice to give it a try . we had to try the appetizers , right ? oh , and
3 a hidden away place i 'd heard about but not yet had the tasty pleasure of visiting . thanks two huge fans who live nearby , i finally corrected this <unk> . split a bowl of their tasty chorizo stuffed dates as an appetizer , which was a mistake .
3 i love this eclectic place . i can grab some tasty food , meet someone for a coffee , or shop some great local products . the staff has always been helpful when i 've had any questions , and i 'm hoping they continue to thrive downtown !
4 we do n't eat here because we were shopping at the mall . we shop in the mall because we eat at nordstrom caf . it is that good ! they deliver delicious food , top notch service and great flavor with such ease that it makes you wonder why
3 this is disneyland for bakers ! they have everything you will ever need to bake and more . for a newbie baker , like me , it can be intimidating . okay , it will be intimidating . however , i can keep walking through their aisles for hours and
3 melt in the mouth stuff . when a cupcake is that good , i barely notice the price . i know people complain about their price , but , i would rather pay the price than pile on calories eating a <unk> <unk> expensive treat . never been to their
2 what 's all the hype about ? yes , the fried chicken was good , but , the good ends there ! the service was slow and they not only messed up our order but also came back twice with food we never ordered to confirm that we , in
2 the brown butter sauce and pesto ranch are both worth trying at least once .
4 i love el encanto . we recently took my grandma and my kid for lunch . if you have n't been you should check it out . there is a really cool outside patio area around a large <unk> pond which really is the <unk> feature of the place .
3 cool place ! we stopped in to check out a very talented friend 's artwork on the walls at cartel for the month . the coffee drinks are great as are the beers .
1 i stopped in for dinner last night based on the menu i found on the web . i was very attracted to the healthy options listed . unfortunately , i passed over the salads and ordered the number two pizza . it was n't bad . it also was n't
3 az 88 is a staple when i visit scottsdale , always a treat ! the restaurant is off the beaten path and has an ultra hip vibe to it . the wait staff is friendly and attentive . the highlight , of course , is the menu . they offer
2 i 'm not quite sure why the restaurant is categorized under `` salads '' and `` vegetarian . '' i do n't know that the menu has any more salad or vegetarian items than most other restaurants . that aside , i really wanted to love the greene house ,
3 stax has become my favorite old town lunch spot and i 'm not usually a burger type of gal . the food here is really good . i love the variety of burgers -lrb- veggie , turkey , kobe , exotic , etc -rrb- and the fact that you can
3 are you one that 's too embarrassed to sing karaoke in front of strangers ?! geisha a go go could be the place for you ! they offer a few rooms that fit 10 + people , so you can invite just those friends that you do n't mind embarrassing
3 a friend of mine has been raving about this place for a while now , and with good reason ! i was finally able to go here for breakfast over the weekend . while my friends raved about their twist on french toast , i have to admit that was
4 <unk> is at the top of my list for climbing ! their staff is always super helpful and they 're constantly changing up the walls . side note though , if you 're a first timer , it 's more helpful going with someone who 's actually been before to
3 i always enjoy trying new places . the burgers were good and the menu includes a wide variety of burger options . good beer selection as well . service was a little slow , but we arrived at the same time as a large group that took up half the
2 i have been here twice now and i am not real impressed . the fish was not very flavorful and one of the friends with us actually had really undercooked halibut . he didnt even want to order anything else as the first bite was enough for him to be
3 this is a great spot for lunch . the patio is a nice place to sit for a business lunch or even a casual chat with a friend . the ahi tuna tacos were excellent . the tacos come with all of the ingredients separate so you can put as
3 the staff is so nice ! some friends of mine threw an art and music thing there a few days ago and we had a blast . the place is laid out nice , it has 2 stages and ample smoking patio space with misters and seating ! -lrb- thats
1 the only reason they dont get 1 star is because i understand they are n't accustomed to the heavier side of music and prolly <unk> a bit when the bad brains came through . that said , this place bites . 1 . they blocked off half the seating ,
1 can i just say , i hate everything about this store . if youre too lazy to go to goodwill and dig it out yourself for a third of the price , then i guess this is the place for you . if you are trying to sell anything ,
3 when i want a completely over indulged , <unk> , -lrb- what diet ? -rrb- meal i come here . i love lolo 's . the staff is warm and friendly . there 's usually a wait -lrb- scottsdale location -rrb- , but it moves fast and is so worth
2 so ... there 's been a ton of hype about this place , it 's always busy , so my expectations were really high . it was good . that 's it , just good . if you are looking for a solid dinner out , this is a great
4 had an absolutely spectacular experience from start to finish , what a fabulous score for old town dining ! we went for happy hour and it is by far the best happy hour in town ! they offer a nice selection of wines by the glass for $ 5 each
4 the sushi last night was excellent . i got the roll with soft shell crab and eel sauce -lrb- ca n't look up the name because they have no online menu -rrb- sushi was fresh , rice was perfect , the roll was nice and stuffed they do n't give
4 this place is amazing . mac n cheese , thirsty <unk> , good music , eclectic crowd , right off the lite rail what else could you want ! the staff here is so personable , they remember your name , what you like to drink & they greet you
1 service is slow , i waited 27 mins just to place my order . my wings were pretty good but they are over over priced to say the least , for what 5 small wings cost here i could pay a few more dollars and get a dozen somewhere else
3 tj 's is a nice grocery store ... clean and convenient . it 's unfortunate that a whole foods is so <unk> located and not all that local , but in the mean time i find everything i need between here and the safeway on camelback and 32nd street .
3 went back in the evening for some more of the delicious bruschetta ! this time i went with another friend and we shared that plus the artichoke dip and a sandwich . we over ordered , but i wanted to try something new this time . he wanted the ``
3 i 've tried their smashchicken and smashburger , but love their smashfries . their burgers are tasty , but as a sucker for yummy fries ... i go here mainly for those when i 'm craving something salty and well , not so good for you - but definitely tasty
3 this place is an amazing place for timid to see what all the buzz is about sushi ! i have been around the block w / sushi . the fun thing about sushi is that its all about the rice and seaweed -lrb- <unk> -rrb- . you do n't have
2 this place is a work in progress . the most important part is that 1 . they actually have an establishment now and 2 . people are going to it ! : -rrb- i was inspired by watching `` killer at large ... '' a documentary about how us americans
3 this place kicks ass in the customer service area ! the waiter was swift taking orders , refilling drinks , bringing the food , and the bill . the special was couscous with some veggies and a mystery red sauce . did n't matter it was good . it almost
3 up selling does n't work on tires ... if i had 500 to blow on rubber ... i 'd get 4 tires hey , maybe 5 . or a lot of ... <unk> . either or . this place was quick and hassle free . my favorite part was when
3 go at 11:30 for lunch - parking is a breeze and easy to get a seat . but they wo n't seat you unless your entire party is there , even if all but 4 tables in the entire place are <unk> . there were more people waiting for the
3 i seem to forget about lenny 's for my lunch break . i 've only been here once and i really enjoyed my cheeseburger . it 's a tiny , busy burger <unk> on central ave. it 's quick too -- they got me in and out and happily fed
0 my fiance called it : `` the place you go to take your kids with runny <unk> and beat them in public '' it was a really strange experience when i went here ... like i was in a twilight world . it was my first time in 5 years
1 just ca n't get into this place ... there are some really nice reviews about padre 's . i 've been 3 times and all 3 times have left me just like `` whatever '' -- not really good , not terrible but more just nothing . the service was
4 alex ` is is the perfect place to bring a client . they serve dinner and lunch . the nice atmosphere is conducive for conversation and eating . there is massive lightrail construction going on in <unk> of the restaurant though so getting in and out is not as easy
2 gon na have to do 3 stars on this one . i 've had in my opinion 5 star sushi and this is not it , but it is still good . i am reading all about this <unk> <unk> service staff but i must have gone on the day
2 our server was very very nice and very accommodating . i liked her a lot . we all liked her a lot . the sushi was plentiful and came on this gigantic boat that was kinda fun . the price was right . but why not more stars ? it
3 oh the bulk bins ... i love the bulk <unk> but i hate them all at the same time . i love that it is so cheap and tasty but i hate that all it takes is one quick cough or sneeze and you can take home lucy <unk> <unk>
3 okay , so it looks like this place is hit and miss and i have an idea why ... ... because people have different expectations on this whole car wash thing . so if you are super picky and have so many <unk> in your car , why not just
3 sacks is growing on me . i think that i like my sandwich more when i do the `` self portrait '' and pick what i want on my sandwich . they have plenty of choices , but i guess i can be picky with my sandwiches . it gets
1 it 's unfortunate that some of my favorite stores are no longer in the biltmore and it 's remodel by <unk> makes it look like all the other strip malls in az . ... what happened to the old phoenix charm ? where did it go ? rumor has it
2 completely mediocre and boring actually . nothing great , nothing bad -- just cpk . it 's there if you are hungry .
3 i have <unk> great time when i go to kobalt . it must be something they put in the drinks or maybe it 's the 9th drink or maybe it 's the good company . this gay bar is my kind of gay bar . i sang karaoke here once
4 this location has become my # 1 favorite location in phoenix . i used to go to the one at town & country because it used to be closer to where i live , but it was always so congested in there -- like crazy busy that it seemed to
3 i was craving this place so i was happy from the minute i parked the car . i had the 2 tacos , rice and beans . the rice and beans were fabulous , the tacos were so-so , but still filled my craving . what i really wanted were
4 when i first heard about this place months ago , i never thought i would be interested . i do n't like southern or fried foods . then i saw a write up in the newspaper where people voted on their chicken versus some fried chicken from some fancy place
1 i 'm not a fan of cowboy ciao . i know a lot of people love it , but i 'm just not one of them . people love the chopped salad , but i do n't care for salmon , so i do n't really care for the salad
3 loved coming here for a recent yelp event ! i have n't been here in a few years . it 's definitely a museum for older kids , so my little ones wo n't be visiting here for a few years . i was able to finally visit body works
4 i am from chicago and this is definitely my favorite place to go for pizza here in arizona ! i 'm also a huge fan of sourdough , so it is pretty perfect for me !!! my favorite is the thin sausage pizza . so yummy !!! parking is a
3 scottsdale quarter has been a nice addition to the scottsdale scene . i love true food kitchen , narcisse and <unk> central . primebar is pretty good as well for happy hour . i 'm not a huge shopper but the retail <unk> seems a little weak at <unk> .
3 on my way home from the baseball game i decided to stop in here and see what all the excitement was about . i drove past it and then turned around and got a parking spot right by the door . i ordered the dogfish shark taco and the cochinita
2 i 've lived in this general neighborhood for several years and had never been to redendo 's . i decided to give them a try for lunch this week . this is a casual neighborhood italian place . i ordered the chicken parm over spaghetti . wow , huge portion
4 incredible experience . short wait to get in and totally worth it ! tony the host was great . we tried three drinks and enjoyed them all . the flaming presentation for the black bomber was awesome !
3 pretty good place to get deals on quality merchandise . i like to buy my dress shirts for work here .
2 i stopped in monday morning to get some help with my iphone . they were slammed and it took me a while to get someone 's attention to make an appointment at the genius bar . the <unk> did a good job of helping me fix my problem . then
2 i 've been to several of the miracle mile deli locations over the years . if you want comfort food , this is the place . i was here today for lunch . one of the specials on thursdays is meatloaf and that is what i ordered . it was
2 i stopped in here sunday for a beer . my friend wanted a gluten free beer but had to settle for a cider . i tried their orange blossom beer and it was just ok .
2 nice place to stop into for a beer . cheap drinks and friendly service . a mix of regulars and tourists . occasional live music at night .
3 i 've been coming here since they opened up as the first restaurant at scottsdale waterfront . great seafood , steaks , cocktails and wine . stopped by today for happy hour . the calamari is awesome and you ca n't go wrong with the $ 5 glasses of wine
3 i really enjoyed my first visit to ab . nice decor and friendly staff . the weather was nice so we sat outside . i had the turkey pastrami sandwich with a side of cole slaw . it made for a great lunch . i 'd like to stop in
2 large outside mall with the usual chain stores . several of the restaurant spaces are now vacant .
3 last week was my third visit to noca . since it was a thursday , i had the wagyu pastrami sliders . they were very good . thick pieces of meat on nicely toasted bread . house made chips were great on the side . good service . top-quality restaurant
4 amazing place . i waited a year to try crudo and it was every bit as good as i hoped it would be ! walking in i was immediately impressed by the minimalist decor . like the food it was crisp , clean and modern with touches of comfort .
3 i stopped in yesterday around 5 pm for happy hour . i like the new decor and that they moved the bar back into the center of the room . the appetizers were half-off and i tried the shrimp and grits . they were delicious . spicy seasoning , creamy
4 fantastic day saturday for lunch at central bistro . the doors were all open and the breeze and light from outside were wonderful . my lobster bisque was great and the burger hit the spot . service was friendly and efficient . i ca n't wait to come back .
3 i 've been to the grimaldi 's in dc ranch and the one in old town . this new location is very good as well . in my opinion , the best seat is at the bar facing outside . the view of the mcdowell mountains from that spot is
3 these guys have a nice place in a great location . i sat at a table in the bar and watched part of the saturday round of the <unk> . as previous reviewers have mentioned , there are plenty of flat screens here . i ordered a grinder , fries
3 i 've been having lunch at one place or the other that <unk> , the owner , has worked at for almost fifteen years now . why ? good comfort food and good service . i stopped in here yesterday for lunch . the weather was nice so i sat
3 i really like their chocolate chip scone . it tastes great and really is quite large . also , it 's nice that they have a selection of newspapers to read while you are there .
2 i was here recently for the rattlers arena bowl game . kinda cool to see football in a basketball arena . lines were a little too long for the concession stands .
2 this is the place to go in scottsdale for an italian beef . when i visit chicago i usually go to al 's or portillo 's for italian beef and having al 's here saves me the trip to the windy city . the decor here is nice with several
2 fun place . food is decent . i was here on super bowl sunday and it was packed . i 'd consider it again as a place to watch a game .
4 this review is for lunch only . both of my visits were on days with perfect weather . the doors of the dining room were opened up to the patio and the scottsdale mall . it was a gorgeous setting . they have an outstanding lunch deal . for $
3 buried treasure ? this weekend i went strip mall crawling in search of new eateries with interesting tap beer selections . found a greek place buried in the worst location i have seen in a long time . the landlord should pay the business to occupy this space not the
3 nice draft choice at good price fun atmosphere pricey ok food
2 this review is for bass pro 's restaurant atmosphere , atmosphere , atmosphere i make a pilgrimage to this place about every three months . the food is average and overpriced . the service is ok . and there is usually one good pale ale on tap and overpriced .
2 i really liked this place . we came with a business group of around 20 for an early dinner and they got everything out correctly and promptly . the beans are great as is their eggplant . the beef skewers were ok , nothing too great but decent . their
4 i do n't like to give 5 stars especially when it 's my first time somewhere but this place gets it . it smells so amazing when you walk in , fresh baked bread and goodies , yum !!!!!! the menu is expansive and you can find something for everyone
0 meh . seriously , meh . i would never have chosen to come here on my own but my office group picked here for our <unk> luncheon so i was sort of obligated . it 's just kind of ... well ... it 's gross , frankly . i already
3 the mesa location does n't have quite the quaint charm of the tempe location but the food is still great and the patio is ample . all the pasties on the menu are very good and the traditional ones do stay very true to the old country recipes . the
1 this place was ok . i was hoping to be wowed since people really seem to like it . it was a little pricey for what it is . we ordered the chips with the salsa flight . we paid the $ 6 for the refillable chips -lrb- which i
4 i was tipped off about this place by a co-worker . we made a last minute decision to eat dinner here , instead of the vig on easter sunday night . so glad we did ! the food was awesome . the skewers were great and the bbq flatbread pizza
2 was recommended <unk> me to try by a co-worker . had a `` eh '' experience . an `` eh '' experience is what you say when recommending the establishment to someone else . and that sums up my experience . service had a rocky start ... my friend started
0 do n't ever eat here . i 'll never go back . it only got one star specifically because it did serve me food and drink . unfortunately , the service was horrible -lrb- and i 'm a server -rrb- - and it took over 1.5 hours for us to
2 my first visit to the lost leaf was last friday during first friday and we did n't stay for even 10 minutes because it was so packed . last night , after lots of peer pressure , i ventured over there again . it was a lot more mellow then
2 i attended a uye at il posto on mardi gras . i enjoyed it very much . i shared a pizza that was pretty darn good with matthew k and sampled a few other pizzas with other people . i did n't much care for the crust of the pizza
0 my visit to this place was not only disappointing , but it made me sad to think that this place would probably go the way of planet hollywood in a year or two . i had the carnitas and i had to cut -lrb- or should i say saw -rrb-
2 moira has grown on me . they are n't my favorite sushi in the the valley , but they certainly try to be ! their location is much welcome in the downtown phx area . now , i am a sushi snob , so i do n't think they have
2 i was out running errands when i got hungry and decided to take a shot on two hippies beach house . i pulled in and almost hit a crack head who walked in front of my car with two phoenix police officers as <unk> to this <unk> . after waiting
2 los compadres is an a-ok place to stop and have some a-ok mexican food . you order via a friendly counter service and they give you a number . i ordered the chicken enchiladas with rice and beans . they were good ! nothing fancy or spectacular , just straightforward

1 this place is by far one of the nicest sushi bars i have visited . it 's in a great location -lrb- love the biltmore ! -rrb- and it 's seating outdoors is unbeatable . the staff is also dressed up in japanese clothing . i love zen32 for having
3 <unk> . sushi ! this was the place i lost my sushi virginity to , and the place responsible to getting me hooked ! i love the location , right off of the freeway , as if it were a sushi pit stop ! the best part of this place
4 about three times a week i drive by this adorable little coffee shop , wanting nothing more than the time to pull over and sip some morning coffee . this morning , my dream came true : -rrb- parking was a <unk> , the <unk> parking spaces are perfect for
4 i 've seen lola coffee appear recently on one of my favorite blocks in downtown phoenix . the day i finally set foot in there i was pleasantly surprised and am happy to say lola coffee was beyond what i expected , and i was expecting it to be fabulous

4 finally made it to narcisse on friday night and found the place quite fabulous . with it 's glam decor , comfy seating , and pretty views i was a happy camper . i got served my drinks very fast each time i ordered , the music was pretty loud
4 the green belt makes me wish so bad that i knew how to ride a bike . i used to fall of my <unk> as a kid , but thats another story . this place has an awesome relaxed , peaceful vibe . great for a jog , for walking
3 this place was recommended by people at work so checked it out yesterday , and i was not disappointed . i started off with the richest , most moist red velvet cake i 've ever had . was so rich , that i only was able to eat <unk> of
4 i 've only been here during christmas season , the place is so lit up with christmas lights you can see it over a mile away . it definitely has an old dive-y atmosphere , but who does n't like a comfortable , quaint little charming bar that serves cheap
2 not bad but not great . definitely targets a younger crowd - college kids . i like that it has a casual feel , but made me feel <unk> . my drink -lrb- jack & 7 -rrb- was quite stiff - <unk> likes . also , good prices on beer
3 the food here is super good . i recommend the carne asada nachos . my other main recommendation would be the <unk> margaritas . i like coming here for some daytime drinking . great open patio makes you feel like you are on vacation in cabo .
3 man , this place is run like a well <unk> machine for sure , almost military style ! i had been dreading coming here as i am not a fan of crowds or lines . there are always crowds and long lines here , but do n't let that <unk>
4 you ca n't really go wrong with flemings . very romantic , and dark inside . you get what you pay for , and here , you pay alot . portions are small , but thats kind of a good thing if you ask me . service is top notch
3 the food is 5 stars ! absolutely delicious ! but 3.5 stars overall . negatives include the slow service . do not go here if you are already hungry . you can literally feel yourself aging while you stand <unk> waiting for your food . it 's not uncommon to
3 love this place ! the chicken and waffles are better and cheaper than <unk> -lrb- which is just down the street -rrb- . disappointed i could n't substitute my eggs for another waffle or anything , but that 's just how life works , i guess . the food is
3 on your first visit , you will probably go into shock . this is one of the most amazing stores i have ever visited . i 'm not really much of an outdoors guy , but this store will turn you into one . just walking around it is awesome
3 4 stars for the food . everything we ate was quality ! i do love the location . not far from my house , great neighborhood , not sketchy -lrb- so you do n't have to look over your shoulder as you walk to your car -rrb- , quiet area
3 great food , and affordable as well . my wife and i get it to go . it travels very well . i 've had better naan , but overall . it 's great indian when you have the craving . tip : do n't get the meat naan .
4 ahi tacos were perfect but i needed one more tortilla . rice and beans were great too , and it all fit together masterfully . i will definitely be back . this was one of the best meals i 've eaten in a long time . on the downside ,
4 amazing food ! strange location with just enough ambiance to feel like it 's worth the prices . our server was knowledgable and friendly though she could have been a bit more <unk> in making recommendations to some people who were clearly in over their head . i loved everything
1 fish and chips was very bland . i like to have a little bit of flavor aside from the sauce that i put on but this fish did n't have it . it seemed fresh , just lacking . the fries were disappointing too . probably wo n't be back
4 ok words ca n't quite describe just how good i think this place it . my parents were in town for thanksgiving and then back again a few weeks later for graduation . after coming to roka for the first time thanksgiving weekend my dad 's first idea for dinner
4 ding ding ding we have a winner in the over crowded tempe thai battle royal . in a tiny town with about as many thai restaurants as gas stations this one just jumped way out ahead of the pack . i have been looking for one thai place that just

4 i have to second jesse j 's comment about this place and add another <unk> to the list . been here twice now and each time i have left full , delighted and taste bud happy . my favorite things on the menu are probably the appetizers with the millionaire
3 let 's start this off by saying my love of the seattle seahawks and the fact that this is the official bar of the arizona <unk> association may <unk> my view of the place . that being said i have gone to skeptical on occasions other than seahawks games ,
1 why is it so hard to find a good bagel and lox these days ? i really wanted a good small non-chain bagel place to go to -lrb- read : not einstein 's -rrb- to go to with some good bagels and quality lox to have . i had high
1 i 'd probably give a place like this more points if they were n't so damn over priced and had a bit better execution . a fairly small tuna poke appetizer and 2 not that special rolls for over $ 30 without drinks really ? the poke was ok but
3 just tried out this spot for the first time tonight . living in phoenix , my standards for chinese food are not very high in general , but alas ... the boyfriend was craving and prime is just a few minutes from our <unk> we would give it a go
3 what an adorable and oh-so fun local spot to go and get your happy fix ! i went in just before christmas and dropped about $ 45 bucks on some unique novelty items and hard to find vintage candies , plus i had a fantastic time doing so . smeeks
4 shame on me for not dining here sooner . noca is absolutely perfect in every way possible . i ca n't even begin to explain how ridiculously delicious the food is here . you just have to experience it for yourself . my friend and i each each had several
4 as far as atmosphere and drink selection go , it 's hard to beat anywhere in arizona , let alone in downtown phoenix . i love how this spot books free live music every single night , displays local artists ' work on the walls , has an <unk> selection
4 finally tried this place -lrb- i know , i 'm soooo out of the loop -rrb- and i was very impressed . it 's hard to find a great quaint little breakfast place that is actually accessible at all times -lrb- sorry , matt 's -rrb- . the dcor is
1 i want to like this place a lot . grand desperately needs some strong eateries . sapna seems like it should be excellent : cheap , healthy food in a unique <unk> setting . so what went wrong ? i 've given this place several tries . every time the
3 if you like blaring house music , kisras and strong mixed drinks , fez may be your new special place . i 'm a big fan of the the latter two , so i put up with the house music . perhaps i do n't totally fit into the fez
3 went here this morning . as usual , the wait was crowded out to the corner of 1st street . people are willing to wait for good food , i suppose . once you get inside matt 's big breakfast -lrb- it was about an hour wait for us on
3 i had a delicious latte here . they say they have the best espresso maker in town , and it 's kind of hard to argue . this place is hipster supreme to the max and way better than any other coffeehouse in tempe -lrb- sorry , gold bar ,
4 i ca n't tell you for sure . it may be that this place is n't that great . but since i basically just * completed * over a cupcake i think that five stars is the least i could do . i 'm gon na tell you a secret
3 a very tasty place for breakfast . i <unk> object to any place that does n't serve hash browns , but really that 's my only complaint . they have a ton of different <unk> -lrb- you choose -rrb- and you can make your own . example : spinach tomato
4 you know the arrogant asshole that no one wants to like -- because he 's an arrogant asshole -- but everyone begrudgingly does like -- because he 's just so damn good ? -lrb- resist the temptation to say i 'm that arrogant asshole -rrb- well , the original pancake
3 another on the list of items that you simply must have before you die : the tomato gin soup at wcg . i will agree that the place has its misses on the menu , but overall it is a very solid place with at least one completely exceptional soup
2 here 's what i remember about last night 's uye <unk> at shady 's . disappointment . i do n't remember much but i do know that i set a timer on my calendar to go off at 10am today and the entry was mysteriously <unk> : `` blast the

4 one time , before we became `` official , '' i walked into a uye at bomberos and gave dallas g a high five . that 's right , instead of a hug or kiss on the cheek for the man who had graced the sheets of my bed many
3 since the veggie house turned into loving hut , i have been twice , and am very delighted at some of the positive changes that have occurred . the space itself is much lighter , and i feel more welcome by the staff . i also like that their food
3 i really enjoyed lisa g 's . i went with a bunch of other <unk> 's and <unk> 's after the last oye and was pleasantly surprised . i have driven by several times and i love the logo and the sign , and used to live within walking distance
3 i have eaten at the veggie house several times . the food is good , but the service is normally pretty slow . do not head here if you are in a rush . i normally get sweet and sour pork . pretty tasty dish . i have tried some
3 if i liked beer , four peaks would be getting five stars . -lrb- i will say they have a peach ale that is realllly tasty !! -rrb- i wish i were my dad right now -lrb- that 's creepy , i know -rrb- because his cabinet shop is literally
4 i absolutely love kiss the cook . it is the cutest little place for breakfast and i love going here . the quaint little restaurant is decorated with country antiques and most of them are for sale . it reminds me of a place you would find in prescott .
4 the fact that i have yet to write my review of nami should be an insult to vegans and sweet lovers everywhere ! nami , short for tsoynami , is heaven on earth . or the moon . <unk> . wherever there is heaven , there is nami . soy
4 this book store is absolutely amazing . literally all of their books are half priced , but that does n't mean they are the sucky type of books you find in the clearance section of borders . they do have an awesome $ 1 clearance section with a shit load
1 i can not stand this mall . they have some really awesome stores but the people who work in them are obnoxious . most of the people walking around are snooty as can be , and everything is overpriced . the food court has some good selection , but is
3 this is the exact place i love to hate . but i ca n't . i can not hate you , lodge . i just ca n't ! in fact , if this place did n't have <unk> animals -lrb- yes , i just made a word up -rrb- and
4 i love sens a five star now . i would say that there was a complete turnaround in 2.5 months . service issues are fixed , they pour a mean vodka tonic , the wasabi tofu has maintained its amazing tastiness and i really like the location . now if
4 i can not begin to explain the sheer excitement i feel knowing that i have yet to review bop . i better take a deep breath ... ... in ... out ... in ... out ... okay , i 'm good . i love this place and it is so
4 oh mah gawd ! normally i do n't * love * tamales because they are relatively dry , but when i saw the tamale store selling tamales at the downtown public market i just had to try one . they have three regular vegan options in addition to two dessert
4 oh baby ... oh , baby baby ... the original burrito co is 100 % amazing . # 12 breakfast burrito . the veggie <unk> . the cheese <unk> . the tostada . oh , and how can you go wrong with a salsa bar ?!? yummmm ! i have
3 great beer , great burger , great atmosphere . they do what they do and they do it very well . love the hefeweizen and the kilt lifter . love the southwestern burger . parking is not easy , had to park a couple blocks away . did not love
2 after hearing several friends talk about the place son and i thought it would be an interesting place to take my wife for for mothers day . we expected it to be crowded and it was . i 'm not sure what i expected but it was not what what
1 i can tell i 'm getting old . i go to restaurants for the food not because it is the thing to do . i met some friends at the true foods because they heard good things . a lot of beautiful people were eating there . looked like a
3 my sister and i ate here exactly a month ago . it is under new ownership and is so much better ! the old owners were rude and service was very sloppy and bad . my sister and i each ordered the same item - egg and cheese breakfast sandwich
3 the blue moose is a fun place to go to hang out with friends and enjoy some good conversation and some decent food . i have been going off and on to the `` moose '' for almost 6 years . the staff is friendly and the service is great
2 duke 's is my place to grab some lunch when i want to get away from the same old grind of a sandwich . the food is okay and has always been fresh when i have eaten here with co-workers . the hot wings , burgers , sandwiches , and
3 i went here today with a buddy of mine for lunch and it was definitely a very good meal . overall quality was pretty damn good . the thing i loved the best about this place was that they have duck on the buffet line !! i have never seen
4 i have been eying this place for quite some time now considering one of my best friends has checked in here 28 times , and one of my other friends just discovered it and was ranting about it . so last night i had to give it a whirl .
2 i came here on saturday night for my first time . i would describe smashburger as elevated fast food , almost chipotle like in design . it was a very nicely decorated facility and the service was great . a pretty expansive menu for this type of place . a
4 this whole complex is great ! if the dbacks were to actually play regular season games here , i 'd be more inclined to go to because i do not like chase field . just walking up to the actual stadium you walk right by numerous playing fields , and
3 i love when my <unk> are proved wrong . i have actually heard a lot about this place and i know what pho is but actually never tried it until yesterday . walking up to this place , you have the misconception that this place will not be that good
0 i came here for a pre dinner drink before going to fnb . my date and i went in and went straight to the bar . i 'm not going to bitch because i was n't greeted by anyone , i could care less . we sat at the bar
2 ok i do n't understand america 's recent craze with cupcakes . the show cupcake wars and i have heard so many grand things about sprinkles . i had today off and i decided i had to see what the whole cupcake buzz is about . when i walked in
2 gigantic bar , good hh spot . extensive menu with standard bar fare . starters <unk> the entrees . nachos , boneless buffalo wings , onion rings were decent . pass on the hummus plate . good service , but would probably just return for large draft selection .
2 3.5 stars - overall pleased , would <unk> as a happy hr . standby , rated <unk> b/c food was decent , not <unk> . quite pleasantly surprised to discover this airy , spacious <unk> in scottsdale fashion <unk> . stopped in during happy hr . on a thursday ,
3 yum . delish , fresh <unk> noodles . parents are from <unk> , and this passed their verdict as well . pick your noodles -lrb- <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , among others -rrb- , meat -lrb- lamb , chicken , beef , beef tendon -rrb- , and preparation -lrb-
4 there is nothing to say that has n't been said . if you like good wine , food and service check out postino . i would recommend the bruschetta and the roasted beet salad .
1 mediocre to the max with bad service to boot ! i 've given this place a handful of tries and i just ca n't seem to find anything i like . the service is probably the worst part . waiting 10 minutes for sushi rolls that are clearly ready and
4 went back . still amazing . i ate kangaroo !!!!
1 the food has really gone downhill . i used to go here all the time when i lived on that side of town but the last few times i 've gone the sushi was horrible . maybe it was an off day ? i might venture back to see if
3 this is a nice place -- the service is normally good and the staff is very friendly . the location is great because it is walking distance for some of the offices in the area and there are not many other offerings unless you want to hoof it all the
3 overall very happy with this location . i will say straight away that they do have some growing pains -- the location has been very popular right from the start and it takes a lot of work to grease all the <unk> and get a very busy restaurant working properly
3 this place is great and a lot of fun . we ventured over here on a whim because we were waiting for a show at the rhythm room across the way and the traditional rack shack bbq was closed and locked . the decor is quite fantastic and this little
4 <unk> <unk> on a popsicle stick . ever eat a <unk> meal and then want to start all over again because it was just that damned good ? this place is a home run in every sense . not just a regular home run , but one of the ones
3 despite working about a mile away from this place for 7 years , i 've never gone inside , mostly because i 'm scared of places that are the only <unk> business in an entire plaza of empty stalls . i always think they must be moving <unk> <unk> cars
3 i ca n't speak to the various deluxe and mixed concoctions available here , but the basic drip coffee is excellent . every time i 've been here i order just a drip coffee , black . if you add cream and sugar you are going to <unk> the taste
3 an update is long overdue , since i originally rated arriba two stars . i 've been back a few times since , and they have really made a lot of strides toward improving the food and the service . the servers are more `` on '' these days ,
4 in me and my friend 's minds , this is the best pizza place in phoenix metro . i 'm surprised to hear that people feel that the food is not good and overpriced and that they have gotten horrible service . the food : the pizza here is amazing
3 yum ! the food here is always good and it 's a decent price . the owner is really nice and always makes sure that your experience is wonderful . i always get something with gyro meat and it 's usually great . during lunch rush , sometimes the <unk>
4 this is a really great library and probably the best in phoenix ! among the beautiful architectural elements , this place has a pretty descent selection of books and music . there are different levels of the building that gives a great <unk> . there are lots of areas that
3 this place is pretty cool . it 's a real chill atmosphere and there are n't an overwhelming amount of people there -lrb- which i like ! -rrb- . i showed up to meet some friends on a friday night . the inside is great , there is a big
4 yum yum yum ! i love this place 's breakfast burrito and their carne asada . for some reason , the first time i went to the 7th st location , i did n't like it . however , i came back after about 6 months and now i am
1 all i can say is , i really hope this place was having a bad day . i was really hoping this place would be good . i loved their sign out front and was hoping for a new place to go ... but i guess not . when you
0 if the food is terrible when you are drunk late at night , then you know something is wrong . this past weekend i went to this place for the final time . i 've had their cheesesteaks a number of times now and they have gotten worse and worse
3 after attending this year 's burger battle and speaking with lindsey f. about how great lobby 's burgers are , this place has been on my radar for a while now . i do n't get to tempe very often , but when i did , i was going to
3 this is my new favorite place to go to at the new city scape in downtown phoenix . the food , drinks , music , and atmosphere are all great . copper blues is the perfect decision for <unk> drinks and dinner . the restaurant is attached to the stand
3 upon arriving at phoenix municipal stadium i was pleasantly surprised at the quality of this facility . it was easy to get to from the 202 , easy parking -lrb- $ 5 -rrb- , and a nice view of the papago rocks over the left field wall . the one
3 i 've been wanting to try the parlor for months and i finally got to on friday for date night with my girlfriend . i 've heard so many good things about this place so i was expecting greatness , but worried i would be disappointed due to all the
3 one of the only chinese places i like in the valley . i always go with the # 12 lunch combo , the chicken and broccoli . it is delicious and the spring rolls are great too . i highly recommend siu wok if you 're looking for a chinese
4 one of the best spring training sites , second only to salt river fields in my opinion . scottsdale stadium is home to the sf giants and is the best location of all the stadiums . it has a great seating and lawn area . post game day drinking is
3 yay , a hole-in-the-wall mexican joint that 's vegetarian-friendly ! my kid and i loved the -lrb- homemade ? -rrb- horchata , <unk> and all -- even better that its served <unk> -lrb- <unk> ? -rrb- - style . i had the bean and cheese burrito , served some special
4 fantastic pizza and smiling service . i 'm pretty sure that mr. bianco 's special ingredient is love .
3 took my girl to <unk> for her birthday last night -lrb- not that it 's a <unk> restaurant , more that it 's a quaint downtown spot without a wait and decent outdoor seating -rrb- . it was our second time there and we had a great time . they
4 this is the best pita jungle and it 's not just because they have a full bar . the waitstaff seems to care more about your experience much more than the other valley locations . i recommend the lentil <unk> salad and the lavosh pizza -lrb- ? -- may have
2 i admit i 'm not a huge bbq fan , as it usually makes me feel like exploding afterwards but since my dining partner loves bbq , we 've eaten here a lot . the meat is pretty good but at least one of the meats has been dry each
3 this little spot can get really packed . the first time i was here there was a 20 minute wait . the 2nd time the restaurant was full , even though it was pretty late -lrb- about noon -rrb- on sunday . the coffee was excellent , strong and dark
4 i have to admit , i normally do n't like chinese food . in fact , it 's just about the only style of food i have n't fallen in love with at some point in my life . this is a real problem when you live with someone that
3 as much as i like gameworks , you ca n't drink and drive at gameworks ! i like the fact you can drink , drink , drink to your hearts content and then play video games with other stupidly drunk adults at dave and buster 's ! i 've been
3 this place has been recommended to me by family and friends so many times . as an arizona native , i 'm ashamed that i had n't been here sooner . it took a friend coming into town to get me to go and i 'm so glad i did
2 i decided to give green a few other tries . i 've been back for the soynami 's multiple times even . they are very good , almost unbelievable how they make them taste . they do n't have that nasty nutty soy aftertaste that seriously makes me want to
4 i really love bookmans . their huge selection of used books is the best in the valley . in many instances they have a much broader selection of <unk> books , in store , than all the retail chains , and i 've found that even when the retail chains
3 alright boys , get past the fact that it 's a little chick centric , arcadia farms is a great place to grab a light bite , but leave feeling satisfied and content . my group of 3 split the hummus appetizer , and wholly garbanzo bean batman , it
4 review update <unk> <unk> <unk> -lrb- that 's my review update siren . so happy to have stayed at the ho this week . when gabi m told me that firesky was filled and she was putting me at <unk> , i did n't complain -lrb- secretly it 's my
3 mmmmmmm <unk> . nothing like leaving the office for lunch outside in march ! i think andrea and i def brought down the average age a few years , the place has a very `` ladies who lunch -lrb- and do n't do much else -rrb- '' sort of feel
4 this is my favorite place in the scottsdale area hands down . amazing food , nice crowd and always consistant . and it is never to loud - i recall going to mastro 's thinking it would be a `` nice '' place and felt like i surrounded by a
3 loved this place . super cool and beautiful <unk> - nikki . went for happy hour with my love . apps on menu were delicious . service great . also , loved the music playing in back ground . thought the flat screen tv -lrb- in main dining area -rrb-
3 i really ca n't get enough of this place . for anyone who understands true italian food , this is a must try . i always enjoy their fish . perfectly prepared and always served up with delicious vegetables . in my opinion , this place is a bargain given
2 cool bar and ambiance , led tv 's behind <unk> mirrors line the entire bar and somehow perfectly fit -lrb- within <unk> '' i was told -rrb- . i have to say i was not hungry , but tried the blt burger . the burger was prepared perfectly to a

3 we wandered in here after walking back to the zipp 's parking lot for vehicle <unk> . i got a delicious peach iced tea that i did n't want to end . however , i just walked half a mile in 100 degree weather , so it had to .
4 you guys have no idea how long i debated whether or not to leave a review for little woody . it was pretty much a goal of mine to keep it as secret for as long as i possibly could , mostly because the place is n't that big ,
1 i 'm sorry upper deck , i just have to . you just were n't good . at all . you had the ufc fight on and did n't charge a cover , that was nice . but i was n't really there to watch <unk> sweaty dudes embrace each
4 the last time i was here i went with two female co-workers who were mildly obsessed with the idea of me dating our waiter . i 'm no stranger to <unk> cute male wait staff -lrb- cough * roka akor * cough -rrb- , but even i felt uncomfortable for
3 honestly , i 'm only writing this review because i just made a list titled `` places i get <unk> '' and merc bar absolutely has to be on it . because , well , i do . i 'm not sure what it is about the place ... i
3 the best cupcake i ever had . which means , based on my experience with cupcakes , sprinkles red velvet is officially better than : - cupcakes purchased at several bake sales between 3rd and 5th grade - cupcakes my boss sometimes brings in from his wife - st patrick
2 this place is just okay - nothing amazing . we have liked our food here , but it was nothing out of this world .
1 we had a burger and the asian shrimp dish , and both were not good . some of the prices were reasonable , but some were definitely overpriced . the drinks are super expensive too ! other friends at our table also thought that the food was not very good
3 very friendly service and nice atmosphere . they also allowed me to order the kid 's bean & cheese burrito , which was only $ 4 and very large ! it was also very good . hopefully i will be able to return in the future to try more of
3 enjoyed this food at the sunnyslope art walk . very delicious ! it was fun to try food that we have never tried before . loved the pupusas !! our favorite was the pork -lrb- with cheese and beans i believe -rrb- . we usually are not pork people ,
1 eh , this place is not too good . i definitely would n't choose to return here . the food is just ok , which makes it way overpriced for what it is . nothing on the menu is special or unique . we also felt like our stomachs were
1 i would give this place more stars if the prices were lower or the food was better . unfortunately , expensive prices for mediocre food is not for me . we tried 5 dishes here , and neither of us were excited about any of them . the calamari was
3 the food here was very good and fresh ! we were able to try multiple things off of the menu - guacamole , soup , white bean side , salads , and tacos . we just loved the decor of this place ! all the leather was beautiful . we
3 very good food and service ! we got a delicious brussel sprout salad with salmon as well as the french dip . it was not our absolute favorite french dip , but it was definitely one of the better ones we have had . their <unk> dessert was absolutely amazing
2 this place is just okay . the food was decent , but it is overpriced for what you get . also , our server was not very attentive at all . it was a busy night , but he hardly came to our table , and when he was there
4 very good thai food and reasonably priced as well . the service is friendly , and the atmosphere is very laid back and casual . make sure to go in for happy hour . they have some great specials !
3 we really like this place and come here often ! all the food is healthy and delicious . we have had some amazing side dishes , soups , wraps , lavash pizzas , lemonade , etc ! we can not wait to take our out-of-town family when they visit .
4 my absolutely favorite ever cupcake is here - orange blossom . sooo good ! pretty much everything else here is delicious as well . : - -rrb-
4 make sure to sit at the chef 's table . it 's quite an experience ! here you sit at the bar facing the kitchen and the chef himself , razz ! they bring you small plates -lrb- priced at $ 10 a plate -rrb- until you tell them to
3 i consider myself a sort of hot pot connoisseur - i grew up having hot pot at home a few times a year and i 've tried hot pot places around asia and la , where i 'm from . as the only hot pot place around -lrb- that we
2 i had tried five guys on one of the very first days i got to tempe because my boyfriend had heard people rave about it so much . i did n't write a review of it then because i honestly forgot how what i thought about it . but now
3 the location deserves 5 stars alone ! next door to amazing pizza , an epic wine bar , a hell ` <unk> good time pub and <unk> -lrb- thats how i say it , i like to sing or over pronounce everything i do except while in the shower .
4 how many great things can one say about the cartel ? does <unk> work ! yes , that was a statement , not a question . i am in love with the cc , hands down . i have traded my gold starbucks card in for this amazingly delicious start
3 first off , i 'll admit that this is the only place i 'll take my ride too in down town phx . of course , to be unbiased , that 's because its the only place to take your ride too in dt phx . so , let 's
0 i am giving olive & ivy only 1 star because the employees have no idea how to run a restaurant or deal with customers . we went there to celebrate a birthday which did not go too well . first when we made the reservation we were told to come
1 went out with some friends , please be advise if you plan on sitting outside make sure you have a flashlight as there are no lights outside and it is had to see or even read the menu . the outside sitting was packed , felt like a sardine .
0 i agree with yuck . this is a boring loud terrible place to eat . the food is below average and a waste of money . much better places to eat then here . my dad had the meatball sub which was huge but nothing special about it just ordinary
3 what great place to come for a quick breakfast ! i must admit when we pulled up i saw few people waiting outside and thought and told my husband that i did n't want to go in cause there looks like a line . but he convinced me that we
4 i love this place !!!!! we had gone for our wedding anniversary , and i had booked the room through one of those travel websites , and if you do that regularly you now that your room is going to be just a room nothing special . so as we
4 my favorite cupcakes ever ! well just the red velvet ! i love when they put the saguaro 's on them i love that , it makes me feel like we they made is especially for me ! everyone should go and grab a cupcake when they are in the
2 i went here on my birthday with my husband and mother . i found the booth we sat in to be uncomfortable and needing to be replaced . i ordered a dirty martini and it was very good ! good price also . we got the fried raviolis for an
3 i have not had better chinese food since moving to arizona . the restaurant was 3/4 full on a tuesday night !!! with many asian people . i thought in this `` recession '' that having a restaurant that packed was a pretty amazing thing . the service was superb
1 if you are in the area i much prefer thai elephant which is near by . we did a taste test on the soup - tom yum and tom kha . one night we ordered a bowl of each at thai elephant and the very next night we made the
3 clean restaurant . fast service . good breakfast . i only had the oatmeal but it was good and cheap . the iced tea was fresh . my friend had bacon -lrb- looked thick and perfectly cooked -rrb- , eggs and hashbrowns . i recommend !
3 i went for breakfast with a couple friends on a tuesday morning at about 9:30 am . the restaurant was busy but we were seated right away . the service was superb and the food yummy . a friend and i shared some dish with chiles and potatoes and eggs
1 i do n't get it . i thought for the amount of food we got and the quality that it was overpriced . tried the veggie burger . the flavor was fine but it was very thin and crumbly and made a terrible mess . did not like the smash
2 decent lunch . had the vegetarian platter . my favorite was the baba ganoush . easy to find coupons for ... including the entertainment book . the greek fries sound tasty .
3 great , friendly service . loved the potato latkes for breakfast . and the bagel ! mmmm ... i 'm a carb girl .
3 i thought the best part was the ambiance outside by the waterfall . the second best part was the pomegranate margarita . the third best part was my portobello mushroom burger with chipotle mayonnaise .
3 is it just me or does costco have the best hot dogs ?!?! yum !!!
3 great service . nice ambiance . so glad they have kids meals now . last time i was there -lrb- long time ago -rrb- they did n't . so your child can eat for between $ 2.95 and $ 4.95 , including a drink . the happy hour is decent
1 i have been twice now . the thing that <unk> me as soon as i walk in the door is the smell of baby poop . i have no idea what <unk> the smell but it is very strong . my children noticed and mentioned it to me the moment
1 my two stars is for the food and ordering process . i still thing going to the restaurant to experience the organ and bring friends or visitors is a must . they only accept cash or check and that is always inconvenient . very few places do n't take debit
4 this is the best . if you do n't eat diary you ca n't beat how wonderful the fruit flavors are ... how can they be dairy free ? yummy !!
2 food was good . greasy but good . the price of the small glass of fresh <unk> orange juice was silly expensive but it was tasty . i had an omelet with sauteed mushrooms and onions and cheddar cheese with wheat toast and preserves as well as home fries .
3 was nice to be able to sit out on the patio for dinner . we arrived in time for happy hour so we tried the sweet potatoe appetizer . i loved it and my friend did n't care that much for it . she liked the dipping sauce but thought
4 yum ! yum ! yum ! i went with a friend for dinner on a wednesday night and the restaurant was fairly crowded . she got some thanksgiving turkey pasty with stuffing , gravy and cranberry sauce on the side . she said it was wonderful . as a vegetarian
1 i 'm very picky when it comes to fast food mexican . it can be simple but it has to be good . this place had very matter of fact service . the food was done in a quick time frame but it just was n't that cheap or that
4 i like this mall . i like the wildflower bread co. , see 's <unk> , auntie anne 's , <unk> toys , the pet store , build a bear , apple store , nordstroms , kiddie <unk> , ect ect . i think they have a decent food court
3 i ate here for the second time last night . the $ 5 off $ 20 coupon in the entertainment book sealed the deal . the restaurant has changed the menu a bit and added 3 vegetarian options to the menu . the lemon grass rice noodles that i previously
4 i wanted to hate this place . there is n't that much parking . it is packed with only a few big picnic tables to sit outside and eat . it was to hot to eat outside , imo which meant i had to take my sandwhich to go .
1 i was told that this place was no longer cash only and that the service and toddy had gotten better . that person was right about 2 of those things . the guy and girl who were working on the morning i decided to give this place another shot were
3 athenian express has a huge selection of things to chose from . they have salads , burgers , gyros , pasta , subs , and pitas ! there are also lots of vegetarian items . their hummus is out of this world . they make it fresh every morning and
4 finally !!!! the strawberry salsa is back ! here you go , la condesa , your 5th star ! thank you !
3 i 'll keep this short and sweet . snobby waiters/waitresses ridiculous wait times delicious pizza service is an important part of a dining experience but it 's not everything , hence why they only lose 1 star from me . there 's not a whole lot they can do about
1 cheba hut is a place i love and hate . i love the quality of the sandwiches and the fact they 're toasted ! they have veggie options and all kinds of sides and unique drinks , and a variety of tasty desserts . i hate how it can be
2 i only gave this joint three stars because of their classic cocktail menu . not many bartenders make old <unk> or singapore <unk> anymore , and i love the fact that they have a variety of old drinks , plus a huge list of good scotch and other spirits .
4 i could n't find anything wrong with avanti . five starts across the board ! to starters , the decor is amazing . it is right out of a scene in <unk> , or even <unk> . think elegant 80s chic , right down to the <unk> striped chairs .
4 <unk> <unk> <unk> good ! everything that 's been said about the chicken and waffles is pretty much on point . went here for breakfast and in addition to the chicken and waffles , i had the breakfast fries -lrb- chili cheese fries topped with an egg and green onions
4 this place was a pleasant surprise ! the interior as other yelpers described it is pretty sterile , but the food is far from that ! first off i 'd like to point out that jungle curry -lrb- which i ventured to try for the first time here -rrb- is
3 first off , 1 star off for the lavosh . i had the lavosh shawarma wrap , it was super tasty , but after eating it , it felt like i had eaten an entire box of captain crunch aka the world 's <unk> cereal , and the roof of
4 this place makes me a happy girl . it 's just bonus that it 's next to the trader joe 's i frequent . they sell both new and used books which imo is pretty awesome . they have a decent selection of used books but not the best or
3 two words . emerald chicken ! i chose to have mine in a quesadilla and it was fabulous , but it also makes a mighty fine burrito ! <unk> ... make sure to get a lesson in ordering because it will be a bitch if you do n't know what
3 oh monkeypants and i go way back . the first time i went i thought i could hang with my <unk> neighbors ... we had a fantastic time . great drinks , fun atmosphere . younger crowed but it wasnt full of college aged jerks . make sure to stick
3 great place to watch a game ! our neighbors introduced us to this place and we love it ! it 's a great place to go and have a few beers and watch the game . it became somewhat of a weekly tradition for us . great beers -lrb- and
1 ugh , these places are terrible . i 'm not really sure why the husband and i decided to give them another shot , maybe because they 're in a nicer part of town or maybe we were just being nice , who knows . we decided to go inside
3 i 'm not sure why but i am always hesitant to go to restaurants attached to hotels . it could be from a bad experience in my childhood that i do n't quite remember , but i think it 's starting to go away . the husband and i decided
3 i 've never been to the former restaurant that was once housed in this quaint little building , so my first impressions may be a bit different from others . i have always adored this house . it 's absolutely adorable and in such a good location . i read
3 we tried the turf on their big opening night . they had a band playing some great irish music at a volume that i could actually still <unk> with my husband . there were even a few girls who got up to do that step dance business during a couple
3 i 've been to a sprout 's before , but that was quite a while ago , so on my recent visit i was really pleased with what i was presented with ! i like the layout of the store . it 's definitely a little different than your typical
3 a while back we picked up some sweet italian sausage from the farmer 's market and we kept it in our freezer . finally we broke out the good stuff to make our own bangers and mash and it was delicious ! the sausage is flavorful yet mild and the
0 i do not like this dave & buster 's . let me start by saying i am a ridiculous , goofy , immature big kid at heart . i love <unk> and the only thing i love more than that is winning tickets to spend in the prize store .
4 there is n't much to say about matt 's other than they have the best damn breakfast in the valley . you have to appreciate a <unk> diner where the owner makes everyday appearances , his wife runs the place , and they use the best , freshest , local
4 hand 's down this place is my favorite store in phoenix . actually , it 's my favorite store in arizona . i would be hard pressed to find a place cooler than this that caters so exactly to my every need and desire as a baker . i first
3 if it were n't for the absolutely terrible parking situation , i would give this place 5 stars . my husband and i have been driving by this place every single day after work . it has been lots of fun watching the change from katz to postino . finally
3 we had originally attempted to come here a few months ago , but our friends decided it looked `` too cheap , dirty , and gross . '' ugh ... we swore that we would come back next time we were out in the neck of the woods and i
3 we were n't in the mood to go to some boring chain and we were n't having a whole lot of luck searching for breakfast places because we had already been to most of them . after getting a little deeper in the search , the husband suggested this place
2 usually a frc place is a pretty safe bet for me . unfortunately , i did n't really feel that way about zinburger . on the particular day we chose to visit zinburger , we had already eaten and true food , just down the way , went to a
3 i have been really hesitant to start visiting bbq joints because of a lot of recent <unk> . i 've always been so disappointed to maintain that my favorite bbq place is famous daves -lrb- boo chains ! -rrb- i finally gave in and decided to give andrew 's bbq
2 this place is pretty decent , nothing spectacular though . we went one day after driving past this place for months . we just always thought it was closed down or something , it never looks open . the place is a decent size , but not too large .
1 i certainly do n't understand the hype over this place . that 's strike 2 for you guy fieri -lrb- # 1 is chino bandido , bleh -rrb- . the layout of this restaurant is very strange , but i kind of like that they separate the large groups from
2 i 'm not really sure where to start with sens other than i have to admit that i was disappointed . i am a huge fan of tapas , and after hearing that an asian tapas place was going to be opening only minutes from my house , i knew
3 i 've been here two times and both times i have been pretty pleased with what i have ordered . they serve quality food here , have speedy services , and the prices are pretty easy on the wallet . the belgian waffle sandwich is pretty good . i will
4 i 'm always in search of great coffee and this place has great coffee . it 's a little place and if you blink , you might just miss it ! the staff was knowledgable on their coffee and equipment . it reminds me of the type of place you
3 this location gets so jammed packed that its like chaos during the lunch rush . i have always had great tacos here , especially the chicken is always hot . has anyone else noticed that their seating is quite uncomfortable ? i just ca n't sit for too long ,
4 in my opinion , one of the best steakhouses in town . my husband and i go here for all our special occasions and have never had one bad meal . the service is the best just like their steaks . i recommend the caesar salad , fillet , creamed
4 after reading the previous reviews , i do n't feel i have much to add except that you must come here ! the food is incredible . i love the <unk> and <unk> are to die for . this is seriously good food .
4 i am giving flamingo palace 5 stars because they have the best food and service of any chinese restaurant i 've tried in phoenix . i like bamboo house and <unk> , too , but this is by far my favorite . my in-laws are chinese food experts . i
4 i went here with my foodie friends not expecting a whole lot . i 'm not that into bbq . but this place rocked my world . unfortunately , it also caused me to gain a few pounds . but it was totally worth it . everything , from the
4 love the food here ! wish i had the money and time to go here more often . must order items from what i 've tried so far : guacamole with <unk> seeds chiles en <unk> cochinita pibil pork enchiladas del mar fish tacos churros rellenos -lrb- dessert -rrb- omg
1 not bad , but no great shakes . the `` large '' pulled pork sandwich was hefty , but kinda bland . lots of sauce helped . sweet potato fries were <unk> and way too <unk> . service was indifferent . you can get better barbecue in plenty of places
4 love this place . inspired , creative , and beautifully prepared <unk> cuisine . just got back from 2nd time here and it confirmed that the 1st dinner was no fluke . nicely diverse menu , love the use of seasonal and organic veggies . everything i 've ordered or
3 really good , really unique . i had never had ethiopian food , but we went out with -lrb- vegetarian -rrb- friends who recommended it , and we 're always game for something new . super-friendly owner and waitstaff . the food was super tasty and lots of fun .
2 concept resides <unk> between in-n-out and five guys . good fast-food burger , but not much more . ca n't compete with delux , zinburger & the grind , but it 's cheaper & faster . <unk> vs. in-n-out are topping variety -lrb- mmm , bacon & bbq sauce -rrb-
4 what you 've <unk> is all true , this place is terrific . $ 1 street tacos were all amazing -- loved the al pastor , carne asada was wonderful , chorizo was excellent , and the fish my wife ordered was as good as any i 've had .
2 i take my clothes here to sell at least once every season . it takes quite awhile ... even if there are only one or two people in front of you . the atmosphere is fun and if you have the time to go through the racks you can usually
3 what make some burros is their hot sauce . what usually makes my friends and i crave some burros is their hot sauce . as with all mexican restaurants , their hot sauces usually vary and some are different . i do n't know how well i can explain their
3 such a great find ... so thankful to my friend who introduced me to defalco 's . it 's an italian <unk> that also serves up a full menu of food . i usually order ahead and either eat it there or take it to go as during lunch they
3 the old spaghetti factory ... well not this one , this one is very new . the one in <unk> so great . very bland ... the food and service were not great . i did n't want to go back but decided to try this newer location . i
3 maggiano 's - this is a bit of a drive for me so i 've only been once but it was a delightful experience . entre prices are reasonable ... our bill added up quickly because we had quite a few add-ons . three people for lunch ... i think
3 big fan of hula 's been a bunch of times , but finally was compelled to write a review . just came back from a week in maui , so i was still in `` <unk> '' -lrb- which is soooo hard to get out of lol -rrb- , so
2 finally went to brio today , for lunch . first thing i said when we walked in , `` are they owned by cheesecake factory ? '' the atmosphere is cheesecake <unk> , with a tuscan flare . the menu is pretty big , nothing really stood out to me
4 had to write them another quick review since my first review of tutti 's . tutti santi has become my only italian restaurant that i 'll go to in phoenix ... folks it simply is the best in town . i 've become a regular here , and the entire
4 what a neat little place . we went around lunch time , but they serve the breakfast until 5 - i was a little bummed they did not serve their famous pizza until starting at 4 ... oh well , a reason to come back ! i had what was
3 ok , but not as good as san tan marketplace one . i had the `` poncho villa '' and it 's basically a red chili burro . was a little to bitter for me , but wife loved it . next time i 'll stick with tacos & enchiladas
3 great burger , not the best i have ever had , but good . great service . good atmosphere . i had the fries too , and they were steak fries style and nom nom . they have a huge variety of food to try , and the people i
4 all i had was a pepperoni and pineapple pizza and hands down it was the best pizza i have ever had in the phoenix area . the crust was light and just flat out tasted amazing . i wish it was closer to me in queen creek . do yourself
3 i 'm giving this one a 4 because i first ate at -lrb- and found out about -rrb- <unk> at the vegas location . over there it was spectacular - here its just amazing . they give you so much food its unreal . you can try anything bbq you
2 small interior , great little patio just off the main drag in old town scottsdale . the place is easy to find because of its funky lodge look it is totally out of place for the neighborhood . i think the place is suffering from an identity crisis . on
3 a nice place to take a date or the wife for a little romance . women just melt for fondue you know . french and swiss cuisine . they place has nice small appetizers and <unk> of crepes either for dinner or dessert . my only knock is the price
2 this place has <unk> the concept of the slow food dining experience but not in a good way . the place was virtually empty and it still took forever to get our food . i ca n't even begin to imagine what this place would be like on a busy
1 imagine a hooters where the girls cut their outfits in half . that is about the only reason to go to this place . it 's a decent sports bar for guys to hang out in but not for <unk> or with your wife . lots of beers on tap
3 located in a non <unk> strip mall and that alone will turn away a lot of people ... for shame . because inside you will find some tasty craft brews from <unk> , papago , four peaks , oak <unk> , san tan , and <unk> . the burgers are
4 great asian place , eclectic menu of chinese , vietnamese , thai and japanese . fair pricing . excellent service . love the beef and onion dish . could be the best asian place in town imho for the overall package . .
3 a nice smaller place with good beer and live music , a few pool tables that give <unk> place a real unique vibe . had a decent selection of bottles and about 8 taps of <unk> beer . prices were reasonable and the service was pretty good although it was
3 located just off mill ave. when the weather is nice it has a great patio . inside is a total dive . pretty decent food but it is a total drunk fest type of place . lots of asu kids and a whole host of regulars whose sole purpose in
2 some good things and some bad things about this place , first the <unk> hour prices are good 1/2 price beer and wine , the <unk> prices are too high with small pours . food was cheap but lacking any real pizzazz , you pay for what you get .
2 north scottsdale sports bar type atmosphere . great four peaks beers but the food is certainly subpar when compared to the main brewery in tempe . the advantage it has over tempe is that it has air conditioning but beyond that tempe is the four peaks to hit .
3 sort of like a poor mans version of ruth chris 's steak house or a rich mans version of frasher 's steak house . food was good but not great . service was very good . plenty of wine choices but very limited beer menu . i find it a
4 as soon as we got word that class was canceled for the day we hit road with one destination in mind : matt 's big breakfast . this was my first experience with matt 's ; my classmate is a little more <unk> that i am , so he knew
1 i want to create a time line showing how bajio went from my favorite early release destination way back in high school to its current situation . i can only guess that the brief period that the restaurant closed down only to be reopened under new ownership was the tipping
3 i 'm glad that living in the southwest has benefits other than excessive use of cacti in home decor . one of those benefits is the food served at z ` tejas , and i will gladly put up with any number of hanging <unk> to get my hands on
4 you know that scene in every `` small town girl goes to the big city movie '' where the stereotypical `` small town girl '' sees the city lights for the first time ? she gets this cheesy look in her eyes like she finally found her way home .
3 i have only been for happy hour , but it is a five star fare ! my high status man candy and i had several margaritas over chips and salsa all for under $ 20 . the casa margarita is a little sweet , but very good once the ice
0 it hurts to write a 1-star review for this restaurant . that being said , do not alter a <unk> and familiar recipe . there is nothing wrong with an addition to the recipe , as the additions can be requested left out of the order . however , it
3 yelp , your mobile app has taken me home again ! it 's nice to have a spot that has not significantly changed in the 20 + years that i have been a patron ... even tho nearly 20 years has passed between my last visit and my most recent
3 clean , comfortable and a very nice place to see a movie . i go often and look forward to returning .
3 i walked in and it was the first time i had ever been to a smashburger . the place was not too brightly lit -lrb- 5 guys get a clue -rrb- , had nice seats , it was clean and had a very good first impression . i had followed
0 saw the crowds as i drove by and stopped in . fantastic prices on mexican grown produce , reasonably good selection , but many of the items such as peppers and berries had already started to turn . the shopping experience brings this down from a 3-4 star review to
3 nice place in the middle of a residential area making it a quaint local spot . really enjoyed the pacifico on tap -lrb- $ 4.25 / glass -rrb- and the nachos <unk> <unk> -lrb- $ 9.00 for small -rrb- . a bit pricey but still a fun place .
1 tried this in tempe but in a quick moment of <unk> i asked for the works and it came that way - my mistake as i hate ketchup and mayo on burgers as it <unk> the flavors and both were included , but that was my fault . vowed to
1 i was a little disappointed in pearl . the sushi was outstanding but the presentation , service and environment left much to be desired . first , the good . they had a very large selection of sushi and all day happy hour . our food was excellent . however
4 love that the flavors change frequently ! great way to beat the heat !
4 love southwest . they are typically friendly , efficient and well priced !
4 great bucket specials ! usually live music and one of the best spots for people watching -lrb- if you sit on the top deck you can look out on to the mall -- hours of entertainment ! -rrb-
3 great service , friendly staff , excellent food ! this location is in the mall so it has a limited menu . i just wish they had more options from their regular menu -- like pizzas and a food happy hour !
4 my favorite place to eat in the valley ! i love postino ! they have the best <unk> in the world . they have some interesting combinations and they all work very well together . the service is great ! the vibe is very chill .
4 awesome place ! food is good , staff is friendly , there is usually live music and it is authentic southwestern .
4 az 88 has a very chill feel . it reminds you of an upscale bar without the high prices . the food is good quality bar food . the place has a good vibe . the house music is provided by a dj at night . there is also art
4 what a nice surprise ! i was initially afraid to try fez because i heard they were connected to metropolis -lrb- metropolis is a joke of a restaurant so-so food and <unk> staff -rrb- fez was a delight ! great atmosphere , super service and excellent food ! i had

2 ashley was a great server . she had a suggestion for everything on the menu . we were there for happy hour which is everyday from 4pm-7pm . when we ordered the fish tacos , she suggested adding a great verde sauce - which was n't on the menu .
3 mmmmm ... los favs ... their breakfast burritos are always on point and so is their carne asada which are my personal favorite in the state so far compared to -lrb- <unk> -rrb- <unk> bs , and <unk> in tempe on mill and southern ? i think that 's the
1 i used to love four peaks up until my last visit and my boyfriends visit as of yesterday . we have been loyal customers for the past 3 + years and we feel as though they are slowly making their way down the drain . let me get into detail
2 can we say overpriced ?? the manager was beyond nice and comforting . which was n't a problem if only the waitresses had the same attitude and attentiveness as their manager things would have been a little more pleasant in my opinion . i hate it when they only time
3 i am upping my score by one star just because i do happen to love their food more right now . their pizza is phenomenal along with a few other things . i shall try their burgers tonight because its been long enough to where i cant remember how good
1 honestly for the price i pay every time i walk in to any of the five guys establishments i feel like i am being ripped off . i am not cheap but i am not out to spend 10 + dollars if i do n't feel like a. it will

3 i was totally hoping for a bill and teds type genghis type guy to be running around smashing shit ... slightly disappointed when the hostess was a sweet snappy lady . we were seated and drinks were ordered . we were then ushered to the beginning of the food line
2 sunday v-day empty and boring . the service was oddly slow and odd in general . the waitress was overly nice and i swear she was <unk> mouse @ disney for a year or two . the food was good but not great . everyone liked what they had but

3 i 'm giving this place one more star than i normally would because i feel like i 'm reviewing it for husband and i. i like spinato 's pretty okay . husband ? yeah , he freaking loves spinato 's . the pizza is nice and thin crust , and
3 this place is a total hidden gem . the food is fantastic , and it 's so cozy and intimate -- perfect for date night . the decor is beautiful , nice and dark with a big brick oven . the best thing on the menu is the prosciutto pizza
4 simple !!!!!!!!! just plain great . do go with the mexican hot chocolate !!!!!!
2 very nice place , great location for sure . walking <unk> from all the life of scottsdale . definitely a place to be seen . could n't tell who was checking themselves out more , the dudes or the chicks . the pool had so much silicon floating in it
3 omg the blue <unk> !!!!!!!!!!!!! so damn good . while we usually go to wholefoods for our filling of <unk> we went up to scottsdale to hit the store . thing the ice cream is a little different at the store then at wholefoods . must be the temp and
3 we decided to have an early dinner -lrb- 5:00 pm -rrb- and since we have n't been to this place for some time ... here we are . found parking in front of the restaurant and we ate out side 'cause there was hardly any wind and there were lots
0 this was our first and last time . why is there an entry charge of $ <unk> ??? we got our tickets on groupon for $ <unk> . and why would we pay $ 2 for an <unk> cardboard box . you ca n't even sample other food trucks ,
3 our daughter gave us a gift card for houston 's , but found out we could use it at bandera 's . we made reservations for 5:30 . do n't even mess around to find parking . i guess i do n't have the ` parking karma ' yet .
3 one of our favorite mexican restaurants . my wife had a craving for mexican food , so we stopped off here for dinner . we 've know about this place prior to moving to az in 1998 . the food is delicious . i keep forgetting to write a review
2 before heading out to the arizona auto show , my wife and i decided to have lunch here . the place was packed , had to wait about 10 minutes . we ordered our sandwiches : wife had half egg salad sandwich with lettuce and sprouts ; i had the

2 we have been here twice , and i am not very impressed with the service . i 'm definitely over the skinny girls dressed like <unk> ; it seems to be like that in every bar now ; if you are sexy naked , you are sexy dressed . the
4 we had breakfast here a few weeks ago and i thoroughly enjoyed it . at first i did n't care for the ordering process ; however after experiencing the service and meal , i was very pleased . i liked the decor and ambiance . we sat on the <unk>
4 i 've been here three times and have had terrific food each time . the meat is incredible and their sauces are amazing . portion sizes are generous and the mac & cheese is delicious ! this is what bbq is all about , definitely one of the best in
4 the princess and i have been huge fans of flo 's for years , since the original flo 's next to <unk> on <unk> before they moved across the street . this location is our local favorite and try to get over from the nw valley at least once a
4 been here four times and have never had a bad meal or experience . the food is delicious and the portions are <unk> , service has always been perfect , and the restaurant itself is beautiful . i 've had maytag burger -lrb- blue cheese -rrb- served with spaghetti squash
2 i have a love/hate relationship with tee pee . i love their chicken enchiladas , rice , beans and salsa . the chicken fajita soft taco 's that jd gets always look good too . but once i was seriously disappointed by the <unk> looking chile relleno thing . last
4 i came here for a pre-thanksgiving dinner with the almost in laws . we enjoyed happy hour drinks and appetizers on the patio to start , and what a great start it was ! we munched on tater <unk> pom <unk> and the sausage plate , which came with assorted
2 i 've wanted to come here for awhile , and decided to do it for my birthday . for a wednesday night it was packed , but we seemed to have gotten the last available <unk> ! i did n't bother with the guac since the majority of the reviews
1 out shopping yesterday i was tired , hungry and <unk> -lrb- sp ? -rrb- so i decided some changs lettuce wraps and wonton soup were in order for lunch . the first time i called it sounded like somebody hung up . i 've cut people off too so no
3 had lunch with the fam here and we were all super pleased with most everything ! we had a seaweed salad , vegas roll -lrb- * best ! -rrb- , spicy tuna roll and split two lunch specials . ma got pork katsu bento box and it finally came out
2 i swung by after a last chance session and picked up takeout . it was super duper fast and quite inexpensive . i couldnt wait to tear into the goods when i got home . when i did , i was unimpressed . the lunch special kung pao chicken was

4 went back for the matzo ball soup when i came down with a head cold and never felt better after eating it ! the best i have had in town !
4 i 've had good times and not so good times here , but the good definitely <unk> the bad by far . last friday i went for happy hour with a total of 7 friends -lrb- one of whom went insanely early in order to save us a table -rrb-
1 buffalo wild wings is a typical chain and the food is as expected . two of my favorite sauces here are the mango habanero and caribbean jerk . the dining area at this location has a ton of tvs of various sizes and most seats in the dining area have
3 i have been to ra a few times and 2-3 have been at this location . my most recent meal here was incredible . the shishito peppers are a <unk> . the <unk> sauce had us tipping the empty bowl over to lick , drink , and pour on our
3 arizona mills is a rather large mall and has a number of good outlet stores . the imax and movie theater are good for catching a show . the mall gets extremely crowded and it can be difficult to navigate through the mass of <unk> mall zombies at times .
4 i visited sweet republic after hearing a lot about how good it was . we split the pecan turtle sundae , which was plenty large for two or more people to indulge . we requested to substitute one scoop of ice cream for a different flavor and it was headed
1 this is a very high end mall and not somewhere that i would buy anything . there are tons of <unk> shops , so perhaps it 's good if you like that sort of shopping . there is also an apple store , which is cool . i visited on
3 tempe marketplace is a modern , clean outdoor mall with a variety of stores . for example , there is target , <unk> , barnes and noble , and harkins theaters . there are also a few different restaurants , including california pizza kitchen , kabuki , and red robin
1 we went back here for the first time since my last update and i can now confidently say that i wo n't be back again . i 'm not sure what happened to this place , but it is n't the tea shop that i used to enjoy . the
2 this is the first japanese <unk> diner i 've ever been to . there was only one other table of people when i visited and the ambiance was dead silent . only one older man working the front of house . he took our order and delivered our dishes .
2 the appetizers were okay . the drinks were okay . the pizza was okay . the service was okay . everything was <unk> . man , i think this mushroom is starting to kick in ...
3 have you ever gone to a place and were so overwhelmed by the menu options that you ultimately just point to some random item and say `` i want '' and pray that they do n't bring out a moose <unk> or a pot of <unk> ? that was our
1 i was really excited to go out to dinner friday night , because i had n't seen my honey in a week and a half . and what better than sushi and a saki bomber to ease back into each other ? we arrived at <unk> p.m. and were seated
3 come for the creative reuse of pallets ; stay for the personal sized <unk> . and the <unk> beers on tap . i was walking back the to train after picking up some baby kale and noticed the <unk> and thought , `` what a crazy random <unk> ! ''
2 i 've never really had any <unk> coming to this best buy and i will admit that my rating is largely due to the geek <unk> , whom i positively adore -lrb- geeks are the new `` bad boys '' : swoon : -rrb- . a couple of weeks ago
3 when robert m and i were in san francisco for his birthday week , we went to the 21st <unk> brewery -lrb- <unk> neighborhood -rrb- and were introduced to the hell or high water watermelon wheat ale . whoever thought that up is a genius , pure genius !! we
3 caffe boa is not what i 'd call an affordable night out on the town . that might explain why after work on a thursday it was nowhere near capacity . but , i 'd also have to state that caffe boa 's business model lends itself well to catering
4 have i really never reviewed lo-lo 's ? seriously ?? this morning , dottsy , robert m and i headed for <unk> -lrb- is that what the hipsters are calling the area just south of downtown ? -rrb- for some chicken and waffle perfection . lo-lo 's hits the mark
2 for some reason , i always worry that 3-stars is a bad thing . it 's not , really . just an indication that it 's good but not great . foccacia fiorentina represents this philosophy , to me . while i 've not had a bad pizza here ,
3 bring your jacket , because it 's colder than winter in here . seriously , i had to warm up outside half way through the night . and i tend to get cranky when i 'm cold . it 's a good thing there was plenty of alcohol to set
4 i 've been here several times for drinking , once for a movie , and twice for the walking dead . at this point , i do n't think there is any other way i can possibly watch this show , because the beers are great and audience interaction just
4 fuego bistro : this is what a bistro should be . had it not been for a great deal on groupon , i do n't know if robert m and i would have made it for dinner here . it 's not that we had n't thought about it ,
3 the roosevelt <unk> a cool vibe that can only be <unk> by converting a historic house into a den of <unk> . ah , a banker 's dream . this is where my coworker , <unk> , and i went after eating at sens. she was going to a blind
3 outstanding . pork leg , tots , beers , food . good . now go eat .
4 i frequent the salon at the resort . michael <unk> the salon <unk> has been taking care of my locks for about 6 years . we first met when he worked for the westin kierland agave spa . michael got my hair back to health after too many trips to
4 okay , i have to start with that i am a bit biased because my boyfriend is one of the managers at zinc bistro but i have always been a big fan of matt carter and at zinc well before ben and i started dating . the food is amazing
4 just get there ! micah 's cocktails are amazing . such a great talent . the truffle popcorn is ridiculous ! you can order from crudo 's menu as well . albacore , ahi tuna , polenta and ricotta are outstanding . love this place .
3 i enjoyed the prime rib , and i thought it was reasonably priced . we sat in the bar which was noisy , but we still got good service from the waitress . the trout and cous cous was also very good . we split the banana cream pie for
3 i wish this place was n't so busy ! it is always packed ! if i did n't have to worry about things like cholesterol , or trans fat , i would eat here more often . great hot dogs , on a real grill with real hand dipped onion
4 happy hour at the bar was the best ! great prices on their amazing fresh and flavorful food , tasty drinks to wash em down .
4 <unk> hoo ! <unk> i think someone <unk> my prayers and hired all new wait staff ! i had previously stopped coming here despite the great food , the service was just <unk> slow and crappy ! but low and behold i went to breakfast , on a saturday morning
3 the food is really good here . you wo n't be disappointed with the quality and great taste . service is very fast too . only issues i had were no wi-fi , and the portions were a little on the smaller side . however , i 'm 6 '
4 amazing selection of food . vegetarian and vegan friendly . great service . high quality food and great selection of wines . reasonably priced . wonderful atmosphere and great outdoor seating . what else do you want ?? : -rrb-
3 the food here is great and service is excellent . do not come here if you want <unk> mexican food . its super americanized , but that is not necessarily a bad thing .
4 holy good mother of god . now this is what i 'm talking about !!! hot pizza , a full salad bar , awesome sandwiches , a <unk> <unk> , an bbq bistro and a ethnic food bar mixed with an outstanding selection of crisp , unique beverages to wash
3 okay 4 stars for the joynt . <unk> s. summed it up best with saying it 's `` good for a standard breakfast '' , because it really is nothing special , picture that `` grease spoon '' place that your dad always used to take you to and take
3 surprisingly i 'm going to give 4 stars to sushi roku . here 's why ... being that it was my first time to this location i was super skeptical because it sits at the w hotel in old town scottsdale , which is nice but , it 's a
0 yuck , blah , cough , <unk> , gag . hearing everyone talk this place up , we headed over for some post drinking philly 's one night which as we all know , is like god 's gift to you at 2 am . funny part is though ,
3 i came in here for a co-workers birthday lunch , and i was very impressed with the place . first off , you ca n't beat the $ 8.99 lunchtime buffet . they had your traditional indian offerings out there , such as curry chicken and tandoori chicken , along
3 located in the heritage square area -lrb- right across from pizzeria bianco -rrb- , the rose and crown is a great little bar that packs a ton of laid back charm . as a converted house , the front porch area has plenty of room for sitting outside and enjoying
4 once you eat here , you 'll never want to go to another <unk> place again . the food here is amazing , and it all boils down to the sweet pork . so delicious , and if i 'm ever unfortunate enough to have to head to the electric
3 when i am in the area , i like to frequent this cheesecake factory for lunch . i always try to go early or late , but never right at noon . this location is nestled between plenty of office buildings and if you go right at noon , there
2 we used to go here a lot ... until they took the smoked ham off their menu !!! the waitress told us that not many people liked it , but every time i was there , people were eating it . the smoked ham was our family 's favorite ,
0 grimaldi 's , i love your food , but your customer service is horrible , therefore i am forced to rate you as a 1 . let 's take last night as an example . i went to pick up my large pizza and a salad . i saw my
2 what a mixed bag for me . i used to love this place , i really did . there was a time when a group of my friends considered <unk> to be their <unk> home - and we were here at least two or three times a month . -lrb-
3 one of my roommates was extolling the beauty of bosa . i asked if they were as good as rainbow , but she had never tried rainbow . so - we decided to do a taste test . three of us in the house - so we would get 3
3 i 've lived in this city a long time . i 've heard great things about christopher 's for as many years as i can remember - and even better things about the happy hour . i never made in until this week for restaurant week . shame on me
3 i made it to french grocery today for the soft opening . and there is a lot to be done before a true grand opening , but i am loving what i see so far ! we ordered 3 cafe au <unk> -lrb- with <unk> , as it should be
3 the fantastic mr. it 's complicated and i went here for lunch today , and as we 'd experienced separately in the past - the food was great ! based on the foods he 's disgusted by , i did n't order what i was in the mood for -

3 weekend with my sister , who was visiting from nyc . we spent the weekend in <unk> and were making dinner for a small group of us sunday evening . dessert was the easiest part of dinner to figure out - stop at rock springs and get pie ! we
2 i have to give compound a middle of the road three stars based on <unk> several experiences here . i 've had stellar times , i 've had awful times - but the music will keep me coming back . am i rating a music venue that serves food ,
2 about as pretentious as it gets in scottsdale . dark and noisy . expensive drinks . not really my kinda a place . but if you 're into that kind of thing ...
3 one of the best happy hours around , but come early to get a spot on the patio because it fills up fast . the green chili pot and sliders are worth checking out .
3 big fan of this place . one of the best <unk> to <unk> in scottsdale . we went friday night and ate at the bar and the food was great ! minus 1 star for being an oregon ducks bar ; - p
3 like everyone else says the ambiance is very nice - for a restaurant in a strip mall . but hey this is scottsdale . the food was definitely above average and interesting - not just typical american thai food . i 'd definitely like to go back to try some
1 i honestly do n't know what it is about this place . we stopped in for a drink and to catch some of the <unk> championship game and it was pretty dead , but the vibe was just weird . pretty unfriendly , not welcoming idk - maybe its just
3 <unk> and chaos . always a good time . plenty of bar sports to keep you entertained , including <unk> , shuffleboard , and even <unk> , which doubles as a <unk> table . and they have a stripper pole , good for watching people <unk> themselves -lrb- do n't
0 i am pretty sure this place is the inner <unk> of hell . first of all , what is the point of an `` appointment '' system if you have to wait 20 minutes past your appointment ? second , who do you even check in with ? the employees
4 mom & pop , hole in the wall , call it what you will , but this place is delicious . their sweetened raspberry iced tea is the best i 've ever had , perfect when running errands down mill on a hot day . they brew each glass individually
3 much better this time around . the gm , kari , sent us gift certificates after my negative review , with an apology . we gave king 's a second chance on saturday night . this time , we were seated in the bar area , which had a lot
3 i love sprinkles cupcakes . i 've never had a problem with <unk> or lack of flavor . the red velvet is my absolute favorite , followed by lemon or peanut butter . yummm ! the counter girls are always smiling and friendly . yes , the cupcakes are a
2 i 've been to chop shop a few times now , and while i appreciate a new , relatively inexpensive healthy place to grab a bite to eat , i 'm just not super impressed . the first time i went i was n't very hungry and was hoping for
3 i will always have a soft spot in my heart for panchero 's as i am from iowa city , home of the original panchero 's location . it is a staple in downtown iowa city nightlife ; there 's really nothing better than a ginormous messy burrito at 2am
2 if i was vegan , i would probably give this place 5 stars . i usually come here if i have a vegetarian or vegan friend that i 'm trying to accommodate . their tsoynamis are great and the brunch is also really good . i do n't like that
4 i had the pleasure of doing beer school here with a few other friends . the chef came out and presented each dish that was prepared with the beer . every course was delicious , plentiful , creative , and it was so obvious that the chef cared a lot
4 how have i never reviewed short leash ? i am so impressed with this food truck . brad and kat are always friendly and gracious , even when lines are 40 people long and they 're running low on supplies . i 've never had anything here that i did
4 i loooove copper blues ! they have tons of beers on tap and they frequently bring in local bands . they really make efforts to keep things interesting here by participating in local events and all of the live music . the food is decent and i love the huge
4 i am so addicted to india oven that it 's <unk> . i 've been known to come here at least once a week , and occasionally by myself if i ca n't drag anyone in with me . eating alone at a buffet is not usually worth the shame
3 i walked in and <unk> party was playing on the speakers . this is a good sign , a very good sign . i went there for a <unk> <unk> and it was a nice , intimate , and quiet space for us to chat . the drinks are reasonably
3 yesterday , i dined at the pita jungle . i was thinking the place would have decor similar to rainforest cafe with a jungle type scene , but that was not the case . it was a well maintained sit-down restaurant , but with more of a chill atmosphere .
4 upper wine pizza and bar has a very chill atmosphere and had delicious food . i came here with a generous groupon . the menu had a great mix of items from pizzas , wings , salads , sandwiches , and a whole lot more . we were initially were
4 one of the most disappointing things in the phoenix metropolitan is that restaurants close extremely early on weekdays . that is not the case with ticoz . i was driving around downtown phoenix looking for any place to eat after picking up my friend at a nearby hotel . we
3 this is the much classier and tastier version of your baja fresh and chipotle . it seems that they really take interest in providing the fresh ingredients . i have n't had this dish myself , but i heard the sweet pork is amazing . i had a taco salad
3 i have been to a few games here at the us airways center . what i like about the arena is that traffic and parking is a lot more <unk> than going to other stadiums that i have been to in the past . the actual stadium has great seating
3 taiko has to be one of the best japanese places i have been in the valley . the menu has a lot more than just sushi . sushi is amazing and great , but there is a lot more variety to japanese food than just sushi . i got a
2 i have had some pretty good lebanese food in la , and i was expected mouth-watering flavors and the tangy flavors of the cuisine . i think i set such high expectations , but the food was still good nonetheless . i would have to say the hummus was delicious
4 i have driven by us eggs several times on my way in or out of old town scottsdale . us eggs has to have one of the <unk> buildings i have ever seen for a restaurant . one morning , i decided to give it a shot . i did

3 so i am here with a recommendation of am amazing chopped salad . i did n't know my recommendation was to burger place ! i do have to say it is more of finer dining place still . i got the turkey grind to go with my salad . i
3 family business bagel shops are my favorite . i found this place through groupon and decided to check it out . the name itself intrigued me as lox means salmon fillet that is cured . i did n't go with salmon , but i got a honey wheat bagel with
2 shame , no four peaks beer on tap when i was there ! any decent tempe bar needs to carry at least kilt lifter ... this place is known for their wings , although if i 'm in the mood for wings i prefer native new yorker for their better
3 i wish i <unk> closer to this place because it is oh so good . if you live in arizona , you got ta love fry bread . and the fry bread house certainly delivers on those cravings . my personal favorite is the dessert fry bread with honey and
3 this is a great spot for weekend brunch . everything on the menu is a good option , i especially like their quiche . their mimosas are also delightful . it can get busy like any good brunch spot in scottsdale , so i recommend going on off hours .
3 such a great collection of asian restaurants ! we always come to this area of town when we 're craving chinese food .
2 i think luke 's is just so-so . a group of us chicago transplants at the office made the trek to luke 's for a nice friday lunch . i did the combo sandwich and i was a bit surprised that for the price fries did not accompany the sandwich
4 this is far and away the closest thing that i 've found in phoenix that rivals the great hot <unk> places back home -lrb- windy city gyros in <unk> -lsb- on broadway just south of <unk> park rd since someone asked -rsb- -rrb- would be the gold <unk> almost brings
3 i 'll go generous on my 3.5 stars for leo 's . the staff is super friendly and the restaurant is spotless . i ordered the kalua pig plate lunch and found the rice to be , well , plain rice as it should be and the macaroni salad was
3 i 've been here plenty of times since i moved to phoenix seven years ago , and i 've finally had a dish i was n't thrilled <unk> . it was more like <unk> pork slices , not anything like i 'm used to . but ... this is the

2 bah , this place has gone downhill imho . i went to the promenade location for lunch this week craving some good corned beef and chicken noodle soup . nine dollars for the combo plate -lrb- no drink as again they serve b.s. pepsi products -rrb- and i sat down
3 pita jungle is pretty decent i 've had their chicken shwarma plates every time i go . it 's pretty <unk> <unk> on the walls is for <unk> of place . not to say that 's a negative , just a weird vibe for me personally . haji baba is
2 um , so if you 're a stickler for sanitary <unk> of food preparation including the island where you get condiments , you might not like this place . i do n't believe that there 's anything quite wrong with this place with that regard , but the fact that
0 i 've experienced better , much better . the prices are too high , the food is mediocre . i went here once when i had a coupon and i would n't go back . it smells bad inside , the food just was n't good and i was just
4 amazing food & the absolute best horchata that i 've ever had ! the atmosphere is great including the paintings inside and new <unk> they put outside . the food is always fresh and there 's a variety of different salsas to choose from at the salsa bar . great
4 amazing is all i have to say about this place ... the end ! okay , i have to rant on about this place , it 's delicious !! i was looking for a location that served the best of the best for pizza and saw spinato 's come up
3 located in the center of downtown , this place is a good place for some happy hour or good lunch ! under new management they have taken some items off of their happy hour and lunch menu . dinner here is amazingly delicious also ! if you got for lunch
1 man i was very disappointed with my experience at big earl 's . maybe i hit it on a bad night but the food was not good at all . it might have been the <unk> bbq i think i have ever had . my girlfriend and i left dinner
3 i have been here for breakfast , lunch , dinner and it has not disapointed me yet ... awesome happy hour options & pricing with a friendly staff .
4 the food is always top notch and the so are the drinks . come to think of it so is the vibe and the service , so i guess that makes it a no brainer . it has some <unk> on the menu that are all good and everyday there
3 always my favorite coffee shop . too bad the baristas remember my fianc but not me , even though we always come in together . <unk> . but that 's okay . i can take <unk> in their georgia peach tea and <unk> english muffin . toasted with just the

2 if you come here expecting good service , in the exact same fashion i 'd laugh at a crappy comedian . the service is awful , they forget minor things all the time and give seemingly smart ass answers when you have questions . me : `` what 's <unk>

2 this restaurant is n't great , but it 's a really comfortable place to stuff your face with mostly standard mexican fare . the service is usually very good . overall , mi patio serves its purpose . it 's a fun and friendly place to have a fattening and
3 well i 'm glad that i had a heads up about the location . it was a little difficult to find . after taking my family on what seemed like a wild goose chase to find this gem , and after almost giving up , we found it . we
3 i did n't know what to expect coming to a pizza place that has gotten rave reviews from people in arizona . i did n't know what would come of a chain pizza restaurant . was it going to satisfy my east coast palette ? or was i going to
4 durant 's is my go - to place for special occassions . i have many fond memories of sharing the `` porterhouse for two '' , which could be called the `` porterhouse for five '' in reality . the <unk> strawberry shortcake is classic and their coffee is worth
4 i am a pizza snob . i usually do n't like gourmet pizza . i am a ray 's girl . alas , i have been cutting most dairy out of my diet because of the harsh treatment of the animals . low and behold , grimaldi 's . while

4 just had one of the best meals of the year ! everything was delicious ; from the starter bread to the last bite . the side of coleslaw was absolutely perfect , and would 've been a better meal than most places by itself . lump crab - amazing ,
4 better than fair trade , not quite as good as cartel - though royal 's location and hours are better , and the seating area is more conducive to random people <unk> , which i like : -rrb-

0 this place is a glorified subway . way overpriced ! i went there the first week they opened with a free coupon and i thought i spent too much on the sandwich i got . what really grinds my <unk> is the review of someone claiming its the best philly

3 yum !! i had a great meal at this place and loved their `` no menu '' concept ! you are given a list of meats and asked to cross off any you do n't like , there is also a place to note another other <unk> . the boyfriend
3 i feel like giant coffee is my `` special treat '' kind of place for when i need to pat myself on the back . kind of like when i decide to buy groceries at ajs . their prices are significantly more than what i pay for my `` everyday

4 i just had one of the best meals of my life at this joint ! i ate everything on my plate which is something my small stomach never can seem to accomplish . i ordered a veggie nut burger - which is hands down the best i have ever had
3 i like these dogs because they are more like a sandwich than your typical american frank . they are served on a delicious flat <unk> `` bun '' and are filled with all sorts of toppings - not just ketchup and relish - i 'm talking beans , cilantro ,
4 best pancakes in the world !
4 went here for lunch with my husband on a monday . we ordered the fez salad -lrb- amazing -rrb- and the phyllo pockets -lrb- even more amazing -rrb- and the bruschetta app ... we were very very pleased ! the place is nice and the staff were great ! def
4 i 'm an italian girl from new york and i can honestly say : marcellino is one of the best italian restaurants in the valley . if you like home made pasta , flavorful sauces , great wine and all the other elements that make a great italian place -
1 wtf this place has really gone downhill . i ate here twice last week and neither time was impressive . meal one : my turkey burger was so dry and yucky that i only ate the avocado off the top . the burger was like hockey <unk> . the bun
2 this place is so cute . i love the location and the decor . too bad the service was kind of weird and the food was iffy . not bad . just iffy . the first thing everyone mentions about lisa g is thier meatballs . the meatballs are okay

2 some things good . some things not-so-good . overall i 'm actually a fan of z pizza . please do not go to z pizza if you seek authentic ny style pizza . that would be silly . did you really expect a big italian guy named <unk> to toss
3 if this place was n't so darn convenient i might never come back . despite being pissed off every time i come here , i continue to come back again and again . in zen 32 's defense , they do have : + a great location + very fresh

3 this place has great food , great happy hour , and a really nice staff . and they serve breakfast pretty much all day . pretty awesome by my standards . the hangover sandwich is a heart attack between two slices of bread , but it 's so worth it
4 wow . i ca n't believe it took me so long to finally visit pork in the fork ! even though i 've been seeing all the positive reviews for a while . well i bought a groupon several months ago for it and i totally forgot about and came

4 i must update my first review of san tan . after visiting many breweries in the state this is probably still my favorite local brewery . first off i like that it 's in an old bank in downtown chandler . i also like that they have garage style doors
2 this mall is decent . the type of people that come here make this mall more appealing then some other malls -lrb- cough az mills & fiesta mall -rrb- . it is n't a ghetto mall except for the <unk> store i 've ever seen called <unk> . sorry tom
3 first and foremost , always use a coupon . if you live in chandler they should come in the mail every other week . this will save you at least $ 12 . everyone here is friendly . the food has never disappointed and i 've been here about 100
2 the hair that was baked into my muffin was not as delicious as some may believe . watch for hairs before you bite into your muffin . ; -rrb- luckily the service , especially the guy at the register -lrb- oliver -rrb- , were really nice and made the experience
4 every time i come to this location the food is perfect . the burgers are so juicy and cooked to perfection . they have a condiments bar with fresh vegetables . the fries are my favorite of all time . they have the new soda fountain machines that are touch
1 no bueno . the food here was not that good and the options were limited . i ordered something and they were out of it which forced me to eat something i did n't want . the bruschetta was pretty good but not worth the price . only came here
3 i have been a fan of true food at the biltmore for a while now and recently decided to try this location . my husband and i loved our lunch . we started with the edamame dumplings which were very tasty . for mains my husband had the bison burger
2 had never eaten here before but due to seeing an amazing coupon deal decided to try it out . for two people you can get 4 courses for $ 29 ! basically you are only being charged for the entrees . the good was the appetizer of coconut shrimp ,
3 had a yummy lunch here after strolling around the gardens . tried the beet salad with chicken and it was delicious ! my 3 year old daughter had the hot dog and fries which she enjoyed . i really wanted to sit outside as it looked really pretty out on
3 dined here again recently with my husband who thoroughly enjoyed it . we had a 15 minute wait to be seated but that is all good ... <unk> to know you are not the only people who would like to eat there . we tried the turkey burger and the

4 i do n't know where they get the pickles that go in the beef gyro 's but i can not get enough . so yummy , i always ask for more . this place takes me out of the desert and puts me in a much more hip city .

3 very cool place ... another great place to spend a saturday afternoon with a good lunch and good drinks !
3 such a cool place and so glad to have it downtown at cityscape ! they have a great happy hour with $ 3 wells and 1/2 price appetizers . the pretzels with 3 dipping sauces are amazing and worth the visit alone !
3 great german place in downtown glendale ! the atmosphere was really nice ... not sure why they seated us in the bar when everyone else was seated in the front dining room though . our server was very helpful in making beer and dinner recommendations . the food was pretty
3 another place we had driven by countless times over the last many years and finally stopped in for happy hour . we arrived right at 4pm when the bar was opening and it filled up immediately ... apparently the word is out that this place serves up an amazing happy

2 i have driven by this place so many times and always say i am going to stop in ... well , we finally did ! the food was quite good , but the service was definitely lacking . they were more interested in talking to each other instead of serving
3 i love the fact that this is a steelers football bar ... definitely makes me a fan ! we watched the game this morning with steelers fans and enjoyed $ 3 iron city beer in the can and free yellow jello shots - not a bad way to spend a

4 everything here is great . i 've had the salads -lrb- fav is parm crusted chicken -rrb- . had the sandwiches and pasta also which are awesome . soup is good . have n't had the pizza cause i usually eat that at pomo , sauce or grimaldi 's .
3 had the tortilla soup for a starter - awesome ! wife had an asian salad and enjoyed it . i had the skirt steak on top of some veggies . would def get it again . for dessert had the rum cake , it was good but not warm all
3 love this place . the atmosphere is so adorable . i would highly recommend it for a girls night out , a date , maybe rent it out or see what they can do for an engagement party or rehearsal dinner . it 's just such a cool little place
2 this seems like it would be a cool experience , and i can see why people would be stoked on it , but it 's just not for me . when i hear `` leather recliners '' i 'm thinking plush lazy boy chairs and that is not what i
4 finally , a southeast asian food pulse around cenpho . when i first moved here , one of the things i noticed was how few choices there were when it comes to asian cuisine . so nice to see something a little less common like cambodian food get represented .

2 if i had to include `` value for the money '' as part of my rating , they 'd get 2 stars . i gave them 3 because they 're in scottsdale and if you ca n't afford a $ 4 cupcake , then do n't go to scottsdale .
2 a good mozzarella sandwich for arizona but nowhere near the one i had back in jersey at joe <unk> 's in pt . pleasant . i had to park down the street , even on a saturday at 2pm . paid $ 20 to take home a <unk> & basil

1 i feel bad giving this place such a low rating when one of my good friends fiance used to work here . we went for my birthday and it was subpar . the cut of steak was nice , the ambiance was nice , the server was nice , but
3 i debated between giving this place either 3 stars or 4 stars . i think if they needed to make 1 major improvement it would be a better system of getting cars into the establishment . on a saturday night , you will be waiting in line for 20 minutes
0 i love chompies . i really do . just stay far far away from this place on sunday morning / afternoon . the place is incredibly understaffed . table for 3 with a baby . told us it would take 15 minutes to sit . it took more like 30

3 we -lrb- me and husband -rrb- are pretty happy with the location of this new wine bar , since it 's within <unk> distance from our house . the decor is nice , cool patio with couches , full bar and a nice little menu . we met some friends
3 last time i was at furio was for a chick dinner and it happened to be monday manicure night , which was pretty fun . i 've been here a few times , once for a bachelorette party , once for happy hour and once for mm night . all
2 alright , alright , calm down . this pizza is good , but why do i always walk out with a $ 70 tab for 2 people , for pizza . come on ! we did get the tiramisu , but the waitress could n't even confirm for us if
3 so <unk> fusion sounds disgusting . the first time i ever tried it , in fact , i hated it , yet a week later , i could n't stop craving it . a fair warning was given by my friend , sean m. that i would n't be able
3 i still like lux better . cartel is very appealing , though , to those who know their coffee . the menu is not huge , but it does offer basic , good drinks . they have plenty of syrups to flavor your drinks , if that 's what you
4 maybe i am just a sucker for music venues in general , but rhythm room gets five stars from me . buried in the heart of phoenix , it 's the perfect place for a band to draw a <unk> crowd . i 've been to <unk> several times to
4 i could eat at carly 's every single day of my life and still never get tired of it . i am amazed at the wide array of drinks that they offer as well as the extensive food menu that offers vegetarian friendly items . sandwiches , salads , soups
3 we started with the mushroom appetizer - deep fried and dipping sauce is horseradish flavored - very delicious ! i had the grilled salmon with sweet potato and broccoli - all perfectly prepared - my date had the <unk> - for dessert we had the brownie and ice cream which
1 abuelos has been there for a long time but for some reason i have never been there . so i decided to try it . walking in , i was very impressed with the decor - looked like the cheesecake factory - or maybe a casino . sat at the

4 this is the best gelato i have had . small place , but quality is great . i get a small size with pistachio on one side and pineapple on the other . walk down to zia and check out the cd 's while you are eating the best gelato
3 delicious salted caramel cupcake . best sweet and savory dessert i have found .
4 i love lola ... the matador is simply craveable !
4 i always have a soup nazi moment here . once i ordered a ` navajo taco ' and not an ` indian taco ' -- a mistake i will not make again . they are hardcore , but pretty much some of the best food you 'll find in arizona
2 it was a well-priced happy hour for an upscale place , but i found the offerings to be quite limited . burger was just okay , salt & pepper shrimp was accompanied by green bean fries , but they were all covered in the same soggy batter .
4 best breakfast in the valley - hands down !
3 so now i know what my favorite vendors are doing on saturday mornings ... nice to see tammie coe cakes -- wish they would have had their cookies ! <unk> 's and mama <unk> 's will battle for my red sauce <unk> , but you must pick up some bloody
4 i would say they have earned my business for life , but it does n't feel like business when you 're treated like a friend . the ambiance , charm and <unk> of this place makes one feel right at home . delicious deli items , an eclectic wine offering
3 once again , the yelpers helped us when in unfamiliar territory . we stayed a couple of nights at the 3 palms and ended up having breakfast here and satisfying a late night munchies craving . as stated in other reviews , this place is very clean . n ot

3 this is just more than just a run of the mill fast food burger place ! while the habit has other tasty offerings , you wo n't be disappointed in going with the burger mainstay . if you are looking for something other than the bland , uninspiring , and
4 wow , this place rocks ! i have been there twice , once for lunch and then again for early dinner . they have a full menu for happy hour which runs most days from 11:30 <unk> and an outstanding wine list , many of these wines are on special
4 just had an amazing dinner here tonight w good friends ! this place is yummy !! all dishes are prepared with less than 475 calories but you 'd never know it by the flavors . they do n't use any oils in their preparation . we enjoyed the house specialty
3 we stopped in for lunch recently and had a great experience ! salads were fresh , hot bread served , and service was very good ! another sam fox restaurant that did n't disappoint !
2 mucho gusto is like that girl who if she just put out a little more effort she would be the love of your life but she never does . mucho gusto has so much potential but zero consistency . now i have gone here probably five times and have had
1 ok i love sandwiches . i was the kid who had the same turkey sandwich everyday for lunch growing up by choice because i love sandwiches . now with that being said i live near old town which is lacking a good sandwich spot in my opinion . so when
3 went to lunch at los dos molinos today and was impressed once again . i always like to ask the server what their favorite thing on the menu is and hate it when i get the most expensive response , today i did n't ! i was recommended to the

3 really happy i finally checked out urban beans last week . friends have been yelping about it -lrb- off line , not here ; they 're not yelpers , that 's why i used a lower case y -rrb- . anyway i really liked it ! it 's a serene
4 this is the best pizza i have had in arizona hands down - it is even better than nyc pizza , in my opinion . after trying multiple different pizzas i have come to the conclusion they are amazing and when you ca n't decide which of two you want
3 i love the wine selection here ! sometimes there are even wine tasting events that are great ! the food is really solid too . i have tried most of the menu and have never had a bad dish . my all time favorite is the steak . my only
4 i ca n't say enough good things about postino . as far as locations go , i think gilbert has the best food overall followed by postino arcadia and then postino central , but i would give all of them 5 stars except postino central which i gave 4 -lrb-
2 the first few times we came here we were so impressed and we were really looking forward to our last visit here . however , we were surprised with our extremely disappointing experience . the first problem started when we ordered our drinks , one did n't come , the
4 what is n't there to like about ocean club ? i 'd like to start off by saying this review is for the bar only . i 'd rate the restaurant a little lower at about 3.5 or 4 stars . the bar is amazing . there is good live

3 we really enjoyed our meals here . almost everything was great . the place is super cute inside and is much bigger than it appears when you walk in . we started with the mussels appetizer which blew me away . this is the first place that i have been
2 i went to this restaurant for an early dinner with my boss and coworker a couple of weeks ago . we arrived around 4pm and the place was empty which was n't surprising given the time of day . my first impression was that the place is chic and upscale
1 the beer is cold , but nothing memorable . i had the vanilla porter -lrb- like a lackluster version of other well-known , better executed vanilla <unk> -rrb- . it was cold and hit the spot , but that is about it . my husband had the <unk> ipa and
3 the good : the beer selection is excellent ! personally , i enjoy <unk> 's irish cream milk stout and the orange blossom . they have a good selection of craft breweries from out of state too . the bad : the customer service is seriously bad . we have
4 this <unk> loves the thai steak and noodle salad . holy <unk> !!! lunchtime was beyond busy but we arrived just before the rush . our waitress <unk> was fantastic and she made the experience that much better . houstons where have you been my entire life ?
3 i love there food , atmosphere , and there hip staff , which you could see working at trails . the portion size is <unk> and the service is pretty good . i have noticed a couple more locations in phoenix and glendale , will definitely be trying them out
1 i recently visited the clarendon kitchen for the first time . we went on a sunday after church with about 6 people , myself included . the decor was great , kinda <unk> meets chic . and the <unk> made out lips were stunning !!! that was the good ...
4 if you have work to get done and need lots of room , free wifi , great food and coffee - this is definitely your place !
4 great atmosphere for just hanging out to read a book or even get some work done . staff is always friendly and the coffee fresh . yes , they even have free wifi
4 jeff , the owner , took what was a great coffee shop and turned it into an awesome destination experience . the place is always filled -lrb- which makes for some great people watching -rrb- and it is a treat just to kick back and relax . if you love
4 still a fan ! this time around i tried the chicken hummus platter . de-lish ! i phoned in the order with no problems . the chicken had a nice seasoning to it and their hummus is simply wonderful ! i do n't know why i did n't try this
1 this review is for the wireless booth in the store . heard purchasing a phone here vs. through my service provider is cheaper and you get some extras like a case and a car <unk> . this is true , i believe i saved around $ 50 on the phone
4 5 stars for the <unk> and the customer service ! sam the <unk> chatted it up with my boyfriend and i while we ate our <unk> at the counter . my boyfriend is from texas and knows his <unk> . we 've noticed the sign on the sidewalk and finally
4 we used to do our weekly sunday breakfast at chompies . . that was until i got serious food poisoning from them and vowed never to go back . this left me and my family in quite the pickle ... we love local breakfast places but hate chain restaurants .
3 this place really has everything ! i love browsing through all of the isles at all the different foods and buying new things . i also love to buy my sushi making supplies here . why <unk> i spend $ 10 for a bag of sushi rice when i can
3 our family loves oreganos ! their salads are sooo good and the pizza is to die for ! my 2 favorite go to 's are : alfredo the dark pasta with chicken - creamy and spicy alfredo sauce with big curly noodles , and a nice fire roasted chili on
2 i have been here for valentine 's day dinner as well as happy hour after work . i much prefer hh after work . it 's very laid back and quaint which is nice for hh and glasses of wine under $ 10 are 50 % during happy hour .
3 this bar is unlike any other that i 've been to on mill . most bars on mill either smell or make you feel too old if you 're out of college . this is a great laid back feel with a nice atmosphere to just hang and have a
4 who does n't love four peaks ? this is a great place that 's good for happy hour drinks and appetizers or just dinner . the food is delicious every time and the beer is always cold and yummy ! the parking can sometimes be a pain with the tiny
3 man , i love this place . seriously . the decor is awesome . the huge <unk> chairs . bench seats . leather couches . chandeliers . the wallpaper . the nook where the band plays up front . the bar . heck , even the people are pretty .
2 went in here on a random weeknight to meet with a couple friends . it is not at all what i expected . if you 're looking for a good dive bar in the valley ... this is it . i do n't mean dive bar like patty 's that
3 surf and turf burger is terrific . crab boils are always a <unk> in my book . staff always friendly and well trained .
4 every lost candy i thought i would never find again sitting in bins or bagged up ready for purchase .
4 best doughnuts in chandler . fresh doughnuts made throughout the day . every drink under the sun besides coffee .
3 good nachos , breakfast burritos , and regular tacos .
4 awesome burgers ! one of my favorite burger places . pretty simple menu . what size burger do you want 2/3 all the way up to 1 pound and how do you want it cooked . they have a few favorite selections that come with certain things on them but
4 where has this place been hiding . took my wonderfully beautiful girlfriend here on a surprise date after we saw a movies . this is one of her favorite restaurants and i wanted to try it out . plus take her out for a nice dinner . everything was very
4 i have never been to a charleston 's before . i have seen the commercials on tv but never connected that this was the place i was seeing advertised . it was the girlfriends idea to come here on nye before we hopefully went to a show at gammage .

2 never have i been to a pizza / bar in az better then here and i ca n't believe it 's taken me 20 ish years to finally give this spot a whirl . pros : great pizza , cheap beer , waitresses that do n't <unk> , great appetizers
3 this place would make my grandma proud to live in az if she was still around drinking a bud light and playing the slots : -rrb- the buffet was to die for , but a little pricey at 25 a head . the cigar room was perfect with a well
2 i like the atmosphere , it seems familiar but it 's not . we tried the lunch special that was an open faced green chili meatloaf sandwich and the grilled salmon salad . both dishes came out pretty as a picture with the food stacked high . the meatloaf sandwich
2 now i know why the tables have sleeping piggy lights on each table it is funny since they do n't serve pork . -lrb- they are making fun of the guest because you feel that way after eating here -rrb- a giant whole squishy onion bread comes out to you
1 if i base my review on just the tacos at their price point two stars is accurate . their were lots of things i did like about sol mexican cocina . they present you with above average salsas and and spiced <unk> . the margaritas were good and strong but
4 short story execution of food was perfect . flavors and seasonings were spot on . some unexpected elements of surprise moves the food past four stars . perfect portions , not too much not too little . atmosphere maybe is n't quite five stars but i was happy with the

4 this time i was unsure between four and five stars but it was close so i went with five because most times everything is usually nailed . it is very hard to pass on the prix fixe $ 25.00 three course menu and both of us went with it again
3 the most delicious thai dish i ever tried was the spicy pumpkin basil with chicken from lao thai . that <unk> squash -lrb- japanese pumpkin -rrb- has the taste of a <unk> mixed with sweet potato . the sauce is a very balanced sauce with perfect spice heat the right
2 oy caramba ! the last time i ate at one of these caramba 's someone there highly recommended getting the <unk> salad saying that it was delicious and tasty and he thought it was the best dish they make . it 's listed as a salad so i was expecting
3 sophisticated refined asian tea house that is in a turn of the century bungalow serving very reasonably priced well crafted foods . we decided to try for lunch and were told the plates were small so we ordered three plates to share but really two plates would be enough .
4 everything is always good here but the <unk> italian ice is mind blowing crazy good ! if that stuff was sold in tubs at the supermarket bunches would be sold . the texture was like slightly <unk> snow that seemed light as air . the flavor was not too sweet
2 the atmosphere is mostly hip and modern and not your daddy 's steakhouse . you have to park in the garage as we did or valet park to dine here . we shared the ahi tuna tacos . they were fresh and were a generous portion . i liked the

2 this was a nice stop in a good location of old town scottsdale very convenient to the farmers market . we decided to start with the grilled cheese salad to share . the salad had a grilled cheese sandwich cut up in small cubes all over it . some of
1 the duck pond was my favorite part , but it is kind of dirty and lacking pond plants for the turtles that live there . if you are shopping along this strip and need a break this will do because it is not the worst but also not the best

3 it 's not the biggest or highest <unk> of merchandise among the costcos in the area , and <unk> spectrum mall , home of the first <unk> experiment is kind of `` modest '' in itself , so i 'll save that 5th star for the bigger , <unk> ones
1 i found our server to be completely fake , and somewhat condescending . she just seemed to tolerate our party of 2 . she was less than attentive , providing no plates or silverware for our appetizers - i <unk> the situation by getting them myself . the margarita was

2 this really is n't the best pita jungle out there . the food is great , but i rarely get my food the way i order it . servers are kind , but seem overwhelmed during lunch - often we get our food and do n't see a server again
3 this place reminds me of my first job , a hostess in a now closed chinese restaurant in chandler . everything was exactly the same - the <unk> , the <unk> ... ahhh , the memories . lunch specials were $ 5.95 and $ 6.95 and were a great value
1 i 'm really frustrated . my last delivery order arrived with the wrong pretzels . i do n't like salt on my pretzels . neither does g. my last dine in experience was -lrb- except our darling server -rrb- a disaster . we waited at least 15 minutes for a

3 what ? i never reviewed baby kay 's ? unbelievable ! well , there is not much i can say because every time we go there we end up ordering the same thing ! haha ... and that is the cajun combination : chicken gumbo , crawfish etouffee , chicken
3 stopped here for late dinner after movie -lrb- 9pm on a tuesday -rrb- they were not busy and we were seated promptly . danny was our server , we had water and diet coke . we had the bread to start -lrb- nothing to write home about -rrb- hummus appetizer
3 beers ! good ones ! on tap ! lots of them ! <unk> ! fake ones ! on the servers ! most of them ! -lrb- oh yeah , and music and comedy and food and stuff too -rrb-
3 holy cow . i could be a <unk> if only the method of <unk> was eating the object of <unk> . -lrb- which i guess makes my true natural religion <unk> , but that 's another story -rrb- ` <unk> ^ -rcb- the half priced , half kobe , half
4 brought my family in for dinner on a saturday , and we were literally treated like guests in their home . this great , family-run , independant , unique eatery is just what everyone hopes for in their <unk> . if you 're not in the <unk> , do n't
4 this new place is not your average fast-food <unk> style gyro joint , at all . it 's so much better ... this is a fast casual <unk> dining version of one of those restaurants . the place is an oasis of clean and cozy considering the strip mall location
4 <unk> microbrews - oh yea . hiking with <unk> recently one evening was <unk> wonderfully with a tasty ale on their shaded patio . sure it was warm , but we were together - a boy and his dog and his beer . beautiful , man , beautiful .
3 make whatever jokes you want about the name as if you 're a <unk> 7th grade boy , but dick 's hideaway has really got a great menu of american food . might not be a burger , fry , and shake diner , but new mexican cuisine is american
0 in short : awful food with no imagination , go at your own <unk> . i was in downtown phoenix and it was pretty late so decided to drop by this place . looked ok from the outside but i should have walked out as soon as i walked in
2 in short : average sushi , not much imagination , but the happy hour is awesome . i probably would n't go here on a regular basis if the happy hour is n't so good . the location is pretty nice as well , conveniently located around the heart of
2 in short : great quality ingredients and they stay true to their products but pretty much everything is overpriced . i like their food , good quality ingredients prepared in a way that brings out the best of them . not much frills but the flavours are decent but not
3 excellent service and food with nice rooms did n't realize the westin kierland had so much going for it . staying there , i was surprised how large the resort feels from the inside with the hotel , conference center , spa , restaurants , and golf course . check
0 costco tire department leaves much to be desired ... my wife 's car needed new tires . we like shopping in avondale and headed over to costco . the guy who sold the tires was nice enough and seemed knowledgeable about tires . installation was completed quickly . that 's
2 good food ; bad flies ; so-so service . tried this place with my family after the june 2012 <unk> in phoenix magazine . the restaurant was a little odd to find and the mandatory valet was interesting , but the interior is amazing . the person -lrb- s -rrb-
3 chicago memories from a hot dog and big beef okay , that lead line sounds horrible , but it 's accurate . my wife and i loved portillo 's when we lived in chicago . cheap , good eats and an authentic chicago dog . my father-in-law spent decades loving
3 fun shopping site for high-end stores kierland commons has some uncommon stores ad restaurants that we visit on occasion . ipic is the best movie experience in town . i 'm a fan of true foods and zinc bistro . they have the best apple store in the region .
0 <unk> disaster - we will never be back again , and i would have to recommend -lrb- after this experience -rrb- for no one to go there either . upon entering the restaurant , we were not so kindly greeted by a white haired woman at the front desk .
1 got the # 13 tom yum soup , which was salty to almost <unk> , with shrimp cooked to within an inch of their life , pretty poor example of this type of soup the # 54 pad thai was done reasonably well , however the menu states chicken and
4 finally have a chance to get this post up , and i can not believe we do not have a thread on atlas <unk> because of how amazing it was . they had always been on `` the list '' of places to try , i wish we would have
3 i was looking forward to another establishment this evening but due to some street fair i was unable to get in but it lead me to the parlor and i am sooo glad it did . the vibe was perfect and very cool but quaint and friendly . a great
3 i can not explain how much i love the food here , especially the fungi pizza . <unk> . they have a great happy hour menu from 3-6 and all day sunday , which i appreciate . the service is hit and miss . if only they could be more
3 ok , this place is expensive . like $ 50 bucks for 1 kid 2 adults and that 's just to walk in . plus the planetarium and any extras . on the other hand , it was a full day worth of fun and exploration . totally worth it
4 the list of things that makes this place awesome can go on and on . the service is top notch , you will never be in need of anything . the food , beyond outstanding . i love the filet mignon chopped salad . this salad will move you ,
2 this was my second visit and my last . i 'm a die hard lover of sushi and all things thai and man oh man when you get a bad serving of either one of those , you will never return and that is what happened on this occasion .
4 first visit was during happy hour on a friday at the scottsdale quarter . let me just say , best damn happy hour around and not just cause of the drink specials . the sushi specials can not be beat , dragon roll or las vegas roll for $ 6
2 i love love love , did i mention love fox concept restaurants ? having said that , i have to admit i was a bit disappointed by the menu and this location in general . it was just mediocre . nothing about it was bad and nothing about it was
2 this place is always beyond packed , even when the doors open . on this particular visit , i was one of 15 people waiting in line when the doors opened . i had just come out from a movie , was hungry and wanted the grilled chicken and hummus
4 my review is for the happy hour . we were lucky enough to score a table as we got to brio at exactly 4pm , had we waited 15 minutes and we would have been out of luck . i 'm usually <unk> when it comes to hh menus but
3 i like centurion . it 's got more space now after their expansion , and it 's a quirky , unusual experience . you feel really close to the kitchen and chefs , and the food is always good . it 's terrific that after 5pm weekday and all day
4 i 'm a cheap bastard with expensive tastes . so my reviews are geared toward getting somewhat `` foody '' dishes at what i consider reasonable prices . with that said , thirteen north gets one of my very rare 5 star reviews . i only dined there once ,
1 went there for lunch . split a chopped salad and a deviled eggs . large portions . salad was a bit heavy on sauce , but i liked it . deviled eggs had some truffle oil which made them pretty good . burger was gigantic . ordered onion rings that
3 downside is you pay for street parking . and tiny , tiny inside area where the owner claims he can squeeze in 25 people , but more than 10 is entirely too close for comfort . go there when nice outside so you have best options . food is generally
2 cheap beer . strip mall bar . big open space and tables . tons of small tv 's with no sound . tasty , greasy bar food . i came here on a thursday night . beer seemed really cheap ... clearly this is a great place to go if
4 you ca n't go wrong with any dish at lucille 's unless you are on a restricted diet . coming from the east coast , it 's been hard to find some great soul and southern style places to eat . and lucille 's has fit the bill . she
3 cf is one of these places that i have to make a pilgrimage to at least once a year . i love my boston cf better for some reason , maybe cause it 's home . anyway , this past weekend , i took my hubby there to celebrate his
3 i 've eaten there a couple of times and enjoyed the food every single time . if i do n't feel like cooking or want something wholesome to satisfy my hunger , it 's usually one of the first nearby places to come to mind . it 's a plus
3 my korean friend says this is the best there is in the phoenix area . based on the clientele alone i would say they must be doing something right , it is a majority korean americans eating in there . all your standards are delicious , try something new ,
3 tasty food , friendly staff , i can recommend brunch , especially on sundays . wow sangria half price , what a deal ! the 3 <unk> recommended by the waitress were <unk> : proscuitto , tomato and ricotta . i also had the peach jelly crepes , very light
3 dim sum . amazing selection and variety . super friendly staff . extremely affordable .
4 super fast delivery ... curry beef was amazing ! large portions for the money !
4 awesome pizza with super friendly service .
4 the best fast food burger hands down . ca n't beat leaving there for $ 5 and feeling stuffed . i always get the country burger or the mexican burger .
4 being from la , im a huge fan of the diy <unk> experience so i was pretty sad to learn that most <unk> places in az didnt let you cook your own stuff on the table . well , i was sad until a friend suggested we try takamatsu !
3 came here for a little wine and dinner with violeta h. the other night . what a cute place ! the decor is adorable and comfortable . chairs are soft and comfy and the place is low lit but not too dark where you ca n't see your dining companion
4 first of all ... happy hour every day . how could you go wrong with that ? especially when they have a great selection of beers -lrb- domestic and craft from the area -rrb- that come in pitchers for just $ 5 . awesome . service was outstanding . everyone
3 my husband and i were on our way home from vegas , and we decided to stop in phoenix for lunch . we intended to go to another restaurant , but i stopped when we drove by gadzooks . i did n't even have this place bookmarked , but i
1 i never imagined giving this place such a low rating after hearing all the buzz from various foodie sources , but here we are . service was n't great although our server was nice enough once he finally came . the water in the glass bottles was nice aesthetically ,
4 i am delighted to have this place within walking distance of my house . it 's a great place to have brunch with the neighbors , meet a friend for lunch , or just kill some time while you wait for your cleaning ladies to finish up . i get
4 love this place ! first , big props to mr. johnston for renovating an old -lrb- for gilbert -rrb- <unk> instead of doing a <unk> which is more common in the valley . my architect cousin was seriously impressed with the structure . i remember liberty market when it was
4 i love twirl , and i 'm so thankful it 's far from where i live because i might become one of those people who thinks froyo is an acceptable meal replacement . in a town full of identical shops , this is the only place that i will get
4 a couple times a week , i go to a gym right next to joe 's real bbq , and i 'm so thankful i 'm a vegetarian because the smell coming from their smoker would <unk> my entire workout otherwise . so am i qualified to review joe 's
1 i was n't super impressed the first time i tried five guys , so i figured i 'd give them a chance to redeem themselves . alas , i 'm still pretty `` meh '' about them . burger was okay , but the fries are super oily . i
3 hooray for the reopening of china chili ! the new location seems to be much larger than the old one and has way more parking -lrb- two lots ! -rrb- . the decor of the giant dining room is still pretty plain and the music was an odd selection varying
2 it makes me sad to say this , since i was so excited to pay a visit to this cute little place occupying what was once a <unk> shop across the street from my high school , but i was not really impressed with lux . i went twice in
4 my family and i parked our asses at the breakfast bar after a 45 minute wait . and had a perfect breakfast . <unk> was delightful to chat with , but more importantly , the breakfasts were spot on . great cakes , great scramble , amazing chunky breakfast potatoes
4 best burger in town , best beet salad ever . fries to die for . banana split off the hook . groovy ambience for dinner , casual chic for lunch . my most recent trip , took a business partner for lunch . wait was <unk> at 12:30 , and
3 first trip to the new <unk> 's <unk> was solid . for those of you who never had the privilege of visiting the original scottsdale <unk> 's when it was quality , it was a place with a beachy feel in old town scottsdale that served unique sandwiches , salads
2 we arrived at 8 , were told it was a two hour wait on the patio , and we were seated within an hour . waiting with perfect margaritas was great -- but the salsa choices suck and the chips were a little stale . there 's <unk> red and
3 any of the broken rice dishes are really good !
3 delicious breakfast food that you can <unk> to your liking . laid-back , california cafe feel with friendly servers . the coffee was very good and the server was great at keeping our cups filled . although all our meals were supposed to come with toast , we substituted it
3 stopped in for a quick drink & instantly fell in love with the place . loved how they had fresh ingredients . i ca n't remember the name of my drink -lrb- it had kale , cucumber , ginger , etc -rrb- but i loved it - very refreshing !
2 3.5 stars pretty good gelato chain restaurant with a decent selection of gelatos at normal prices .
2 although i 'm no chicago native , i 've been there and can say that this place does n't do chicago dogs justice . we ordered the jumbo chili cheese dog , italian beef , fries , and a burger . everything just tasted okay . the italian beef was
3 loved their portobello sandwich ! the pizza is pretty good as well although not quite like a ny pizza : -rrb-
2 my husband and i brought my mom here when she was visiting to grab breakfast . they were a bit unorganized . the food was okay , but the service was pretty slow -lrb- constantly had to flag down someone for refills of coffee -rrb- , but they were nice
3 went around 10:30 on a sunday morning and did n't wait much more than 20 minutes for a table for 2 -lrb- first available . -rrb- very <unk> service to place orders and receive food -- a little slower on drink refills . the prices are decent for the location
2 lots of healthy options , and very gluten-free friendly . kind of a weird location , hidden in the <unk> of those <unk> condos by fashion square that you always drive by and think , `` <unk> , those must be amazing ! '' we went for lunch on a
2 great food , but the service leaves much to be desired . i was meeting family , and when they arrived , they were told it would be a 10 minute wait for a table . no problem . i get to yasu about 10 minutes later and my family
2 we went to zupas on the recommendation of some friends . i was excited to try it since i am a huge sucker for sandwiches and salads . it 's a very bright place with a ton of people behind the counter to help . the menu is pretty large
1 mediocre at best . not too tasty . salsa blah , beans and rice too salty . only thing i feel confident in recommending is the mexican pizza app w / chicken . big enough to share . other than that , the price is too expensive for the food
0 the concept was a great one , but the festival and the food trucks were no where close to prepared for the amount of people that showed up . not sure if it was great marketing or groupon , but there were way too many people there or way too
1 went here for a fantasy draft the other night and was dissapointed . i have gone to half moon a bunch of times now and i have to say the service <unk> their best and the food is typical pub grub . tonight i was really surprised to see that
2 okay , this is n't usually our first choice for quick mexican food , but sometimes you do n't want to feel so guilty after you eat a burrito . the blue burrito offers a healthier version of classic burritos . although it is n't as good as carolina 's
4 food is super tasty ! ca n't go wrong with the turkey panini with pesto or bruschetta with prosciutto , figs & mascarpone cheese . mouth watering just thinking about it . sundays during 11-3 they offer cool laid back tunes by <unk> richardson and $ 5 refreshing white sangria
2 the only thing i can write a review on is the breakfast croissant i ordered and the ambiance . first off , the decor is cool and i like the quaint little coffee house with surprising seating inside . the outside seating is a little less appealing being pretty much
0 i will not be visiting la piccola again . i hate writing this review and i really felt like not writing one at all . i feel like i really need to let this business know where they are falling short . i do want to give a very positive
4 just a quick update ... bertha 's was unable to <unk> their lease and will be shut down for a month or two while they move to a new location . i think they are supposed to <unk> by the end of june somewhere near indian school and 32nd st
3 love , love , love the <unk> pollo ! i 'm not very knowledgeable about persian dishes , but the saffron rice with <unk> -lrb- <unk> -rrb- is an incredible combination of flavors . the portions are much larger than they appear in the pictures on the menu ... the
2 i got ta admit , i 've spent several happy hours out on the patio at brio . our usual server is a cute young thing and he always remembers our tastes . while i 'd like some drink specials for happy hour , you ca n't complain about a
3 so i only went here because it was 10 on a sunday night , and i guess all mexican restaurants in the area close before then . so this was the last option . and i was really surprised . the manager offered us free drinks , i had the
1 i wanted to like this place a lot . i really did . i stayed here for work & it seems like an overpriced , <unk> luxury hotel . it 's like they do n't quite have the luxury hotel feel or execution , but they want to charge for
4 i love pinnacle peak park ! even the park <unk> people are so sweet . we just moved to the area and i love hiking anyways , so it this is just the cream of the crop ! i had to write a review today because we saw a <unk>
3 my teachers always said `` do n't judge a book by the cover . '' and z 's greek completely proves their point ! a co-worker suggested z 's greek , and i obliged since i was feeling quite indecisive . as soon as we pulled into the parking lot
0 first , let me say i really hate to give bad reviews . i love to support local business owners . i drove 15 miles to buy cake pops but when i arrived they were out . the young lady working behind the counter could have taken the time to
4 we went for a late lunch and had a wonderful experience ! we had the chicken artichoke soup and it was the best soup i have ever had . the staff was fast and very friendly . we will be going back !!!
1 i use to really enjoy this restaurant but lately not so much . the food comes out cold and when you send it back they reheat it instead of making you something fresh . this use to be one of my favorite places to eat , too bad !
4 i have liked lux the most of all the coffee shops i 've tried in phoenix so far . i should have gone here months ago ! it was just lovely on a july day . interior has a fantastic , simple feel . the temperature was refreshing . my
3 * sigh * i do love z pizza . if you dine in , you can get two slices -lrb- usually pepperoni or cheese -rrb- and a beer for $ 7 , or you can get a whole big pizza pie - we usually get ours delivered . the best
3 we were in search of thai or chinese on christmas eve night , and stopped into thai hut . i actually have been avoiding this place since reading some reviews describing some downright atrocious service as of late . however , we stopped in at <unk> -lrb- the sign said
4 bookman 's ... wow . i really should never buy books or cds anywhere else . this place has amazing selection . they also have a pretty fair <unk> policy . i think we still have $ 15 credit from when we went here last month ... i 'm sure
4 i think this is my favorite bar in phoenix ... not that i go out nearly as much as i used to in my college days , or that i 've tried most of the bars here ... but i found a place i like and i see no reason
1 the ratings by other yelpers was accurate . . yelpers ! food is expensive and average ... $ 15 marg with don julio ... $ 4.00 taco 's -lrb- small -rrb- and stuffed chili with chicken was $ <unk> , ... best item was the fresh of the guacamole &
3 always good food ! , pho da lat is he best in phx , veggie broth , veggie pho with steamed tofu is awesome , and do n't forget to order the quail appetizer : -rrb- . .
1 over priced and small portions for the $ $ $ . do n't waste your time or money . service is average , . . more of a bar , no draft beers i find odd , tons of better sushi restaurants in scottsdale and phoenix !!! just believe in
4 awesome place . went here when i lived here with no expectations , but thought it was really well done and really cool stuff here . be sure to go once during the day and once at night . people of all ages will like this .
4 this is one of those hidden pizza places with some of the best pizza . it is very under rated and very good . it is worth a visit . do n't be distracted by the weird crappy location of the <unk> of the retail strip mall . it is
4 this is some of the best food in tempe . i did n't find this place until i had lived in the area for 3 years . i wish i knew about it sooner , because i only got about 6 months of this before i had to move .
4 i have visited this locale on a few occasions now and i must say there is nothing like it in all the valley and perhaps the state itself . they host tons of events throughout the year and the yelp party that was held here in 2010 was epic .
3 the outdoor seating could become legendary at this location once more people learn about it . i mean it is simply magnificent ... go at night if you can and i can promise you it is romantic ... exotic ... and exciting all rolled into one . since it is
3 great organic fruits and veggies ... very clean store ... great customer service ... fantastic deli dept. ... fresh fruits and veggies -lrb- <unk> -rrb- ... and outstanding deals every week . i know some people say it is overpriced a bit and that is true to an extent ...
2 visited this locale probably 3 times in the last couple of weeks and each time i come here the deals are great ... and the lines are long ... lol . if your in search of baby clothes they have some true <unk> here ... not to mention women 's
4 costco gets 5 stars in book ... and really it goes without saying why ... but here goes . great deals ... clean aisles ... great service ... reliable products ... great customer service ... and most importantly they honor all the policies that they promise you especially when you
3 wow ... i have to say i am stunned by some of these reviews i have read . the arizona mills mall is one of the best `` discount malls '' i have ever been to ... and trust me i am a mall rat so i know what i
4 i have been to this little slice of soda pop heaven on two occasions now ... just recently this past saturday <unk> . now trust me if you want to revisit you childhood days of going to the local mom and pop store in your hood and searching for that
3 i have to admit when i first visited mojo 's i was skeptical because it was the first frozen yogurt establishment that i had ever visited in arizona . i did n't know about red mango at the time or any of the other establishments that i have reviewed on
3 <unk> in the west valley ... wow what a treat . now while on this day i did n't have any of the food entree 's ... i did have the dessert . the special today was peach cobbler with vanilla ice cream ... and let me state for the
3 i love psc . known <unk> as `` sandwhich shop !!! '' it 's like an oasis in the drunken wasteland of 3 am old town . psc is open 24 hours , and any restaurant in phoenix that is such gets an automatic 3 stars in my book ,
3 i would give <unk> a 3-star rating , but that extra star comes as a direct result of the amazing selection of draft beers this place has . their lineup features lots of domestic specialty brews and a surprising amount of other stuff available . plus , since they rotate
2 i like buffalo exchange , but you have to look at this place like this : - it 's not a thrift store . - i do n't ever try to <unk> anything . there 's no point . the <unk> are very inconsistent and it 's completely subjective and
3 one 's experience at <unk> can really depend on when you go and who you go with . <unk> than most places , it seems . for example , one night i came here with some friends and it was packed to the brim with obnoxious <unk> getting wasted on
2 you know , i 've never been to the black forest mill in the light of day , so my review has nothing to do with its food . as far as i know , it 's a bar . a bar with weird specials , a general feeling of

2 i 'm going to have to agree with bonnie on this one . the <unk> out trifecta creates a vortex at southern and mill that can suck a thrifty drunk into a solid bender without putting a dent in the wallet . that said , it 's probably my least
2 i enjoy the juicy , succulent taste of murder , but i 've also got friends that would skin me if i took them to a steak house . to avoid compromising the values of my veggie friends by forcing them to make me man meat , it 's always
2 i just do n't think i 'm much of a brewery gal . granted , the beer here blows four peaks out of the water , but i 'd much rather have a nice cocktail than chew though a specialty brew . but if beer is your poison of choice
4 this is not a place for the calorie conscious , so <unk> need to swear off this place like the plague . even the salads here are smothered in bacon , eggs , cheese and dressing . but if you feel like <unk> your arteries in the most delicious fashion
3 only ever eaten in the bar during happy hour , so this review is not for old school steak house fare with all the fixins . that 's cool though because i ca n't bring myself to eat a ginormous hunk o ' <unk> very often anyway . i can
3 i 'm clearly more of a food city consumer than an aj 's gal , but this place succeeds in making me feel like i not only can , but should splurge on a five dollar loaf of bread to go with the homemade soup i just whipped up for

1 this is regarding an experience i had at outback this past saturday . we arrived around 6:30 and were told it would be a 30 mins wait . we were n't seated until almost an hour later and it only went downhill from there . we all ordered salads with
0 the first time i ate here last year i would have given them 5 stars , but tonight they got 1 star for the following reasons . 1 . it took over an hour to get our appetizer and food . our appetizer came out only moments before our food
0 wow . what can i say . this experience was pretty bad . first -- it 's in a really bad neighborhood . you ca n't feel safe at all , and this whole area needs 15 times the police that are walking around . price : every time i
2 the 3-stars are because the prices <unk> from the taste of the food . i could n't believe how much they expected from the little portions that they served . this is definitely not a family or college student place . at these prices , this place should be in
4 great service , great food , and great outdoor seating made for a wonderful first time experience at this charming little restaurant . you would think that sitting outside eating in the middle of august summertime in phoenix would be practically unbearable . local breeze made it tolerable and i

4 best gyros in phoenix . for 8 bucks , you get a huge gyros sandwich filled with tasty tzatziki , onions and tomatos on the softest pita bread i 've ever had , along with a huge side of crispy seasoned fries and a soft drink with free <unk> .
3 stopped by this funky looking place around 6pm on a weeknight and no wait . ive wanted to stop here many times before but have avoided the <unk> long lines i see when i pass this place around lunch time . the people inside were very friendly and although quite
3 this place is probably as authentic as you can get , i heard the owners are <unk> and they are serious about their food . the owner was bitching to me about the ridiculous charges on his aps bill while i was waiting for my gyros . he also gave
4 i just finished licking my fingers clean and almost ate the <unk> paper that held my very first , and surely not last , lucky boy international burger . crispy bun , tons of dressing , fresh lettuce , tomatoes , pickles and onions , and a perfectly tender ,

3 okay i gave it another try for a friends birthday and i actually had a blast ! it was a sunday and we had a table but it was a really good time . i 'd go again with a group of friends : -rrb-
2 love the lettuce wraps , there awesome ! the chicken lo mein is really good as well and a lil shot of dessert at the end of the meal is perfection ! not to expensive good food !
3 i went here tonight with my dad and it was cute ! we had a pretzel for an appetizer and it was really good but little small . we both had the salmon and it was very good ! reasonably priced . . the sandwiches looked awesome . . i
2 it was good ... but thats about it ... was n't great or outstanding ... did n't wow me . . for the prices i want wow : -rrb-
2 i 'm not quite understanding these 5 star reviews ... maybe they are friends with the manager or owner . it 's not that i think this is a poor experience . i agree with most of the comments : `` unpretentious '' `` comfortable '' `` great ambiance ''
3 maybe the management is trying to <unk> their carbon footprint - it sure was dark in there . ahhh - but i 'm <unk> the lead . i 'm a fan . good food that combines interesting flavors - like their apricot bbq chicken sandwich . i usually order the
2 true food kitchen has good and healthy food . it 's definitely not a place to go if you want a some `` comfort '' -- let 's say ... french fries with your low-fat turkey burger . i ordered a cup of miso soup -lrb- $ 3 -rrb- and
1 i do n't get it . why the fuss or the great reviews ? i 've gone to various locations - phoenix , tempe , shea blvd. . i do n't understand why people will wait 30-45 minutes to eat here ? the service is n't bad , the atmosphere
2 it 's ok . not great . but ok . especially if you live in the south mountain area where we do n't have many selections of restaurants to choose from . my favorite is the honey seared chicken . they also have a great kids menu if you have
1 i 'm only half asian so i 'm not sure if my opinion counts . tho the price is cheap and the service is lightning fast the food does not stack up . yet the place was packed . there was enough oil on my food for me to deep
3 had a hard time finding this place at night but its definitely worth the drive . parking is also slim but valet is available . this small place comes with excellent customer service and most of all good ice cream !!! will be back for more vietnamese coffee and butter
3 this place is a must for the true buffalo -lrb- the city -rrb- style hotdog lover , plain simple , yet satisfying . but be prepared , this place does not do any other <unk> besides hard earned cash !! btw there is an bofa atm machine a stone <unk>
1 i want to like this place . i really do . it 's near by , it 's local , it 's efficient , and it 's reasonably priced and seems to be a <unk> against the big chain burger guys . it 's just not that great . while
3 good . cheap . tasty . 24/7 . drive through . that sums this place up . highlights : their carnitas platter comes in a styrofoam plate with beans , rice , and two giant tortillas , weighs quite literally 2 lbs , and is enough to put two people
2 i 'd recommend this place highly for two situations : 1 . -rrb- you are on the west side of town and you want some reasonably priced grub , 2 . -rrb- you 've never had vietnamese food and you want to try it out in a <unk> environment .
4 i only give five stars to places that i have been multiple times and been consistently impressed by both the products and the service . it has to be a place that i would absolutely recommend to anyone , any time . it has to be , dollar for dollar
3 i like simple places . the downfall of many restaurants -lrb- imho -rrb- is attempting to do too much . rather than stick to what they can excel at , many owners try to extend themselves into arenas where they should not go . this strategy is usually driven by
0 worst service i 've had in a long time . the waitress was snotty and literally could n't do the basic math necessary for me to pay my bill -lrb- gave her a $ 20 bill and she sat there like ` um , 20 minus <unk> is ... uh
2 i went to bosa donuts around 6 am on friday . they had a good selection , and quite a lot of everything that they had . however other reviewers talked a lot about <unk> fresh the doughnuts were and how good they were . i got 4 doughnuts and
4 the best pho in phx , hands down ! the owners are super nice and totally <unk> to <unk> and changes . i love it !
2 if original hamburger works became a trendy chain with modern decor , it would be smashburger . the burgers , fries and shoestring onions are tasty . for some reason the place smells like raw sewage however . i 'm not sure what that is all about . good burger
0 if you enjoy being <unk> in a tiny space with middle aged wannabe rich women while screaming <unk> babies run <unk> through the store this place is for you .
4 excellent food . good atmosphere . do n't let the outside fool you , the prime is quite possibly the best chinese food in the state .
3 bookman 's is kept up much better than any other used book store i know . they have a nice selection of used electronics as well .
3 it is what it is - very good fast food mexican restaurant in south phoenix .
4 best sushi ever ! great happy hour too . 3-6 and <unk> they have $ 5 rolls and cheap drinks . they have some unique sushi . my favorite is the heart attack ! the environment is really nice too . you wo n't be disappointed by trying this one
4 this is a perfect place to make a quick stop on your way home to grab some milk , eggs , produce or other basic needs . it is a little more pricy than a chain grocery store of course , but you are supporting local farms and businesses when
4 i have to preface that every time i 've visited this location it has been after midnight and i might have been pretty intoxicated . with that said , yummy yummy drunken food ! i love that they are open after the bars close . i love to get a
4 this place is heavenly !!! i have dreams about it on a regular basis . the cookies are so fresh and you can choose two different kinds and two different ice cream flavors . tasty !
1 the reviews for here are spot on . the food was okay . yummy margaritas ! okay salsa , but not great . overcooked chips . but considering we live in phoenix there is no need to waste your time eating here . there are hundreds of better mexican food
3 if you 're not in a rush this place is great ! i went for breakfast and it was really good . the menu is pretty unique . there are tons of things i still want to try ! but it took forever for them to come and take our
4 great pizza and the best red velvet cake i 've ever had !
4 let me start off by saying , this place is awesome !!!! i had the filet medium rare and it was one of the best filets i 've had . the lobster mashed potatoes are a must . it was my favorite part of the meal . huge chunks of
2 was n't super impressed . the seafood was alright , but for the price i would expect it to be amazing . would n't ever come back .
3 i like this bww . i 've had great service every time i have been here . the boneless wings are great and their selection of bear on tap is great . come during happy hour and you can get a large beer for the price of a small .
3 i 've been to this olive garden quite a few times , dining in and to-go . overall , the food is on par with other olive gardens and the service is good . i would recommend this place if you are in the mood for olive garden . my
4 okay , i said i was n't going to do this but i could n't resist . omg <unk> jalapeno avocado and <unk> chocolate . there are no words ...
4 the first time i ate here was at their friends and family pre-opening event . now , in the interest of full disclosure , i was neither friends nor family at that point -lrb- i was discussing a book event with wendy -rrb- , though in typical <unk> fashion i
2 underwhelming - that 's the only word for it . i was really sad about that , too . i went with great expectations of an `` old school '' evening out . the decor did n't disappoint . the dark , heavy furnishings work well in the dim lighting
3 cool , italian pizza place . my husband loves the pizza here . the service is always 5 star . i wish they had more food choices , esp better salads .
2 the service was good . they have some specials for happy hour . overall though the quality of the food compared with price was lacking . nice , authentic feeling mom and pop place though .
3 awesome concept . upscale ambiance . unique gourmet entrees . very expensive . do n't go here if you are really hungry . the portions are small and pricey . come here for good customer service and food that you ca n't get at the chain restaurants . be prepared
3 i 'm going to be honest , i 'll probably be a fan of any buffet . i like <unk> my salad -lrb- where would i be able to order one with hard boiled eggs , corn , bell peppers and one cucumber slice ? -rrb- and getting a random
4 postino 's is a great place for a date or evening out with friends . the arcadia location is in a cool neighborhood and the building opens up on one side to an outdoor patio ... which is awesome on an evening with nice weather . i have to admit
3 i had never heard of crackers until i visited , and i did n't realize it was a chain until just now ! i have been seriously missing out . fiance and i stopped by for lunch , having been called in from the street by the signage . my
3 i 'm always a fan of mimis . breakfast , lunch , dinner ... it 's all good . my old go-to was the french dip with au jus , which had such tender beef . more recently i have expanded my palette , and i also come more often
2 both times i 've been to the sushi room so far , was with a groupon . due to groupon rules , any happy hour items we ordered did n't apply to our available balance , but it looked like some good deals . i 'd probably only return if
3 native new yorker knows their wings ! i would only come here for the wings , and the wings are why i come here . that , and it 's a decent place to sit and hang out with some friends , and maybe watch a game -lrb- or 7
4 i am a fan of amazing noodles and fun fusion dishes , so when a friend of mine told me about this place being his favorite joint and invited me to go , i jumped on it like white on rice . noodles ranch is located in the bashas complex
3 yogurtland <unk> in me the delightful <unk> craving for frozen yogurt . usually when my sweet tooth comes <unk> ' , it 's for cookies . imagine my surprise upon trying yogurtland after a few trips to mojo and feeling so-so ... well , let 's just say i awkwardly
3 so , i am cheating right now . i actually tried this place via catering one day -- so i have no clue what their business looks like , whether or not they 've cleaned their tables properly or if it smells funny . the only thing dirty is how
3 pei wei is like a fast-food version of pf changs -lrb- same <unk> -rrb- . there is something that is a must for anybody trying pei wei for the first time : lettuce wraps . absolutely worth the trip alone . i normally get this for myself as my entree
2 excellent burger ! i had a classic smashburger and order of smash fries . the burger was very juicy and tasty and the toppings were fresh . not the best burger i 've ever had , but pretty dang good . the smashfries are very good - but a very
2 eh . . maybe i went on an off day . or maybe i should n't have ordered a hotdog . i got the chicago , my wife , a regular . it was decent but not worth the drive for me . should of stuck with regular fries ...
2 i do n't know what it is about phoenix , but you ca n't seem to find a decent donut shop here . bosa seems to be about the best option we have , and while it 's not bad , it 's far from anything special . this scottsdale
3 i 've been to gb many times and nearly always have a good experience . they have quite a solid menu all around . i really enjoy their sw eggrolls , garlic fries , burgers , chicken pesto pasta , pizzas , and steaks . the deserts are very delicious
3 some of the dishes at pho van are so good i pretty much just <unk> them . the noodle bowls are wonderful , filled with fresh ingredients , a rich mixture of flavors and variety of textures . the food is healthy and very tasty . they have some exotic
3 this restaurant has really good quality seafood . the menu is large . the restaurant is large , romantic and has a separate bar area . it 's very pretty and classy on the inside , but not snooty , meaning you can go casual and relax . the food
4 i love this place . i 've been to numerous bars , grills , and restaurants . there is nothing i do n't love about this place . first , the food is outstanding , quality , and large portions . happy hour has 1/2 off all drinks and 1/2
4 this is a fun and funky place . any music lover would like this place . yes , it 's done in an alice cooper theme . there is a large variety of <unk> rock and roll memorabilia on the walls signed by a variety of artists . there are
3 color me impressed . given the quality of sushi restaurants in the greater valley area , i was worried about conveyor belt sushi here . i mean , if they ca n't make it right in the kitchen , how is it gon na be on a <unk> belt ?
3 i had been to the mojo on mill , however , i 'd never tired this one . it had far less flavor options than on mill , but they had not one , not two , but three flavors of mochi and a whole ton a great fresh fruit
3 we 're not big fans of chain restaurants , but the cheesecake factory is an exception . you always know you 're going to get tasty food , and a large serving -lrb- usually enough to share or take home half -rrb- . plus , they 've got a huge
2 i never thought i 'd be reviewing many chain restaurants , but this warrants a review . i 've always been pretty happy with chipotle ; you know what you 're getting . granted , the ones in co give you a free drink with a student id , and
4 this is the first gay friendly restaurant/bar in phoenix that i 've actually really liked , and can see myself frequenting on a regular basis . we visited on a week day night , and sat at the bar . our <unk> bartender was sweet , sassy , and kept
3 i love love love ticoz , enjoy switch , and am still out with the jury on fez . <unk> , when there was another restaurant opening , my partner and i were so there . we went with another set of queer folk , and one thing i love
3 i 've been trying various cheap mexican food `` stands '' in an effort to find something that resembles what you find in san diego . fiesta burrito is the best i 've found in the valley . -lrb- note : los favoritos is up there with it -rrb- i
4 this is my favorite breakfast place in the valley . i used to go to the scottsdale location more , but now i generally go to this location , because it is dog friendly ! yay ! the food is of the same consistent quality of the scottsdale restaurant .
2 unlike other reviewers , i 'm not on a <unk> basis with the <unk> . we started with the spiced nuts -lrb- great -rrb- and the rock shrimp -lrb- average -rrb- . the shrimp seemed like a well prepared version of a tgif appetizer . not particularly thoughtful or memorable
4 wow this was a pampered weekend . i would recommend going to this place just for fun . i went with my wife for a weekend of ... hmmm ... and loved it . . so different and new and fresh . staff is nice , rooms are clean ,
4 just like some others have said , the word that comes to mind is sexy ... i actually like this place a lot . very nice and fancy and not as expensive as you would think . i believe in quality and price going together but this place is surprisingly
3 i do love the cheesecake factory . you ca n't really go wrong here , pretty much every dish is gon na be good . i had the mac & cheese burger . fantastic ! just picture a juicy savory burger topped with a patty made of mac & cheese
3 my boyfriend & i decided to try this place ... and we were not disappointed . it was delicious !! cute place , clean , and everyone who worked there was super friendly . i had the miso ramen and the bf had the shoyu ramen , both were so
3 best dive in phoenix . good people & drinks .
4 best torta in az . . i am in love with this place . i have n't even tried anything else , i love their torta 's that much .
1 nasty margarita and awful service . came in on a thursday night before a movie and it was not good . maybe it 's because we sat at the bar ? i 'm not sure , but no one wanted to help us . the house margarita was so gross
2 finally found a dish i like a <unk> . i get the honey mustard salad which is tasty . since my husband is a fan of <unk> i 'll be back .
4 yup best mexican food in the area ! the tortillas are homemade and you can taste the difference it makes . ordered the soft taco combo and it came it rice and beans . ordered the chips and salsa too . was yummy all the way around . will go
4 friendly family environment , i eat alone a lot and they let me sit and read my book and enjoy coffee before my meal . i can only speak to the breakfast items and have loved everything i have eaten here . i do love a good hollandaise sauce and
4 the staff was super helpful and friendly , the rooms were clean and cute and i loved all the pool areas . i will defiantly try a ` stay-cation ' here this summer .
3 great funky band , attentive service on the drinks , and we found a table in this crowded little blues club . i loved that the patrons where eclectic and fun and people wanted to dance and kick back . it was to loud in there either . the bathrooms
1 wifey and i dined here in <unk> , 2008 , and we found this joint to be very overpriced and very average . the place was dead on a weeknight , a bad sign . the room looked like it could hold 300 people , and there were only about
3 i know you 'll come here for the beer , but i have been to this joint twice with wifey , and the food is really good ! we 've had salads , wings , a burger , and appetizers , all items have been very tasty and fresh .
3 we went here for a birthday celebration and had the `` family feast '' deal they have . its for <unk> , but everything was really good ! it included desserts , but i was way too stuffed for anything like that y the time we had finished our regular
4 wifey and i have been dining here for 4 years now , and we really like it . its too spicy for some , and we have tried nearly everything on their menu , with only one or two disappointments . price is right , the salsa and chips are
2 typical sports bar , in dire need of some <unk> ! this place looks -lrb- and smells -rrb- like <unk> , <unk> the hd tv 's . its an ok place to meet a pal for a beer , but no dates , or it 'll be your last date
1 just finished another meal here courtesy of a gift card . this place is always busy and i 've never been able to understand why . if no one ever gave me a gift card here , i would never eat here . the service varies from very good to
3 last time i ate here i left a rather <unk> review , so i figured it was time for a second visit . unfortunately i must have gone to the wrong restaurant because the food here was great ! pastry was spot on this time . firm , but not
2 stopped in for a light lunch on a saturday . service was good , if not exactly warm . the menu was small , but with good variety and the food tasted great . the coffee was quite good as well . my friends and i had 6 different drinks
1 first - the service was prompt and polite . kudos to the wait staff . the brunch menu looks amazing . the reality was not . the promise : corned buffalo hash w / poached eggs , 4 slices of thick cut bacon , and a biscuit with gravy .
4 great place ! finally a great seafood place in the valley . went here for lunch monday as my wife was shopping up the street at last chance -lrb- which i call the crazy lady store -rrb- . nice ambiance and atmosphere . rock star service from bartender heather .
1 valle luna chandler my wife and i were kid free the other night and were deciding where to go and deducted down to valle luna because of the <unk> setting . we got there and parked in the lot and the very first thing you see in the front parking
0 <unk> staff & two separate <unk> hotel experiences this was our second visit here as the staff <unk> the first visit in july so horribly bad that we were offered to come back and stay again . actually that 's not really correct either as when we first stayed there
4 sat at the bar and had absolutely wonderful service . boy does that make such a difference . friendly and knowledgable without being intrusive . we did happy hour . i had a flight of their house beers . really liked their hefeweizen ; crisp and tasty . we had
4 cafe monarch is everything and more that fans say it is . it is `` more '' when you experience it for yourself . lately , i 've been going to some really nice restaurants in town and i can not find anything that can top chef christopher 's food
4 mmm ... mmmm ... mmmm delish ! the toasted coconut ice cream rocks ! very creamy yet lots of texture in every bite with lots of toasted coconut throughout . the dark chocolate was amazing ! such a rich taste . my family also had the icecream sandwiches , but
3 out in chandler today and was excited to finally try this place that was recommended by some locals . was n't sure what to expect for a sub shop . different concept as far as first impressions . place was packed and it was about 1pm . . every table
2 couple things i love in life , hot dogs and maui , now brought together and maui dog proves that hot dogs can have some unique flavor other than plain mustard and/or ketchup . had a beef dog with spicy <unk> and mango salsa to keep the flavors <unk> out
1 lots of glitz and glam , little to back it up . food was meh ... really expensive too . margs were good but i can get the same for cheaper . my friend got sick from the food she ate ... not impressed ... never went back . nuff
3 i 've heard way good stuff about this place for a while and finally had the pleasure of sitting down and having some lunch there . thoughts : staff was friendly and quick , nice place , very clean and some <unk> and lots of tables and outdoor seating as
3 oh yeah . . best little mexican place in these parts . breakfast burrito 's rock !! very friendly staff , seems like family owned because i always see the same two ladies working . their salsa is so good too , and you get a little salsa bar to
2 little slow at lunch but they seemed understaffed . sausage pizza was good and about what i expected from friend reviews . they seem to have good specials on thursdays for `` date nights '' but it 's just average . nothing special but if i was in the area
1 went for the great arizona picnic on saturday and was not that impressed . when i go to something like this i expect to try something new and exciting . what did i get here ? the same spinato 's pizza and salty senorita food i can get out in
3 this time of year , when it 's a little chilly out , or you 're thinking you might be coming down with a cold , i got the cure ... get a giant bowl of pho ! if you 're not sure what it is , or you 're
1 wow , this place was a disappointment . a group of us ended up here around 10pm on a friday night . we were seated pretty quickly . the menu looked good , but was very limited for a tapas place . we ordered a couple bottles of wine and
4 great lunch specials ! the best green tea ever ! love this place . always great fast service .
2 pita jungle is awesomeness ! the only reason i 'm giving this place three stars is because the last time i ate here my lettuce had fruit fly on it . yuck ! the gyro 's i had before the fruit fly experience were tasty .
0 i 've avoided yelping this place for a reason ; that reason is that it sucks just as badly as their other location in the hilton village . the food is horrible , the diners are mostly douches and although this location features less popped collars than the one in
3 baker is my first go-to place when i 'm looking to add to my gardens . tons of natives , cacti , herbs and etc fill their property & i can always find what i need . they also have experts and some special shows on occasion which are very
3 i really enjoy that 's a wrap ... all of the food i 've ordered here has been really enjoyable , plus it 's all a really good value for the money . my favorite wrap here is the prince of thai , sin pollo con tofu . the veggie
3 after stopping by here several times to buy bread on sunday , because pane bianco is closed , i had the opportunity to have breakfast here several times ; amazing food and grocery area . very glad they have a complimentary valet these days but seating can be chaotic .
2 one of my favorite yelpers already said it , but now i will too despite ever been to atlantic city . as a casino this place is a <unk> <unk> of sadness . i do n't compare it to other casinos on <unk> <unk> , due to my active <unk>
1 d i s a p p o i n t e d ! i had long put off my visit to cd , but this last friday was the day . we arrived and was greeted by a gentleman that i was n't sure if he worked there or not
4 sushi , cute girls , tasty beverages - whats not to like ? the dj could have <unk> it down just a tad , since i had flashbacks from a car stereo competition from my childhood . but enough of me dating myself , and i 'll leave my seat
2 i am not a huge fan of fast food -lrb- or at least that is what people are supposed to say -rrb- but sometimes poor planning prevents a situation where one need to eat something quickly . i try to choose a place i have never tried before . this
2 <unk> as a dive in location and by name , it 's not really that divey . in fact it has a established feel to it as i escape the phoenix summer into a dark bar that is far less silly than the sign suggests . i expected an atmosphere
3 sometimes i get this feeling that it is a good thing to <unk> a bowl of frozen meat shavings , then add a handful of veggies and top it off with my own <unk> blend of sauce ingredients . -lrb- yes there is recipes on the wall , but i
2 as much as i like beer and good service , of which both gb has plenty of ; what i find myself lacking as a patron here is personality - even though i get the feeling that , this is by design and not by accident . the food .
3 stopped here for a quick pit stop , had a car full of <unk> person <unk> and that caught the employees attention . this being said , my experience could have been skewed by this . my beverage was great , and that was the general consensus . the service
3 who does n't love a good movie and a clean theater ? yep , that sums it up . i usually frequent this place during the week and i do n't have too many <unk> getting tickets . what is unfortunate is that there is one person at the customer
3 hidden gem . . scary exterior -lrb- especially if you are n't from the area -rrb- . so we found this place on yelp . . drove around a few times and then when we found it , we could n't believe this place was actually where we were thinking
4 `` vegetarian never tasted soo good '' no really , i have been continually impressed . i have been here about 3-4 times and this place has yet to disappoint . so let 's talk about some of the things i 've had : spicy buffalo `` wings '' chili
3 the taqueria is the place to go . it 's fast and pretty good . i 'm a huge fan of the veggie burrito and chipotle potatoes . both are to die for ! that being said , the rest of the menu is good , but nothing spectacular .
3 delicious new mexican cuisine ! they do n't do mild . the staff is friendly and will keep you glass full , but beware that it 's not the quickest service . this is definately a place to go and unwind and take your time eating . food - i
3 holy delicious <unk> batman !! the bean dip is fantastic , almost filled me to much for the good good at dinner . prepare to have you food smothered in delicious sauce !
4 hands down , best donuts in the valley . all the locations are great . most are open 24 - 7 and the flavor is fantastic . it 's a great pickup for a morning office meeting or an even better late night snack after a night of fun .
3 i seriously love this restaurant . it 's an awesome <unk> to kierland commons . the bar is great - bartenders are always fun . the menu is superb - i 've never had a bad meal here . i love their homemade <unk> things . they literally melt in
1 i danced my ass off one night here ! had a blast , but thank god i did n't have to pay for the drinks ! somehow we got passed the cover at the door too . the decor is really <unk> . i do n't remember much , but
0 gross ! their tortilla soup tasted like vomit . after two spoons full i proceeded to throw up in the bathroom ! never eating there again !
2 i used to be a student and this place was awesome for studying and keeping caffeinated . now though , when i go there to relax , i feel like i 'm sitting in a study hall with a coffee bar in it . more power to them for catering
3 laid back , great beer , and a menu packed with variety for everyone . we sat on the outside patio and enjoyed lunch . i got the portabella veggie beer bread since i had no idea what to expect from the name alone ! turns out , it is
3 although i 've never eaten in the dining room , i am a regular at the bar , and have a great time every time ! the bartenders and cocktail waitresses are always so nice , and the band on weekends is super entertaining . i always know i can
3 cute and affordable . finally an alternative that i actually want to go to ! every time i try to break away from the corporate coffee chains , i get burned because their lattes taste like dirt , or they act like they 've never heard of soy milk .
3 once we found this place -lrb- i think we did 3 <unk> -rrb- , we were happy with what was at the end of the treasure hunt . this little coffee house is adorable . it 's got a boutique in the same space , it has a groovy selection
2 mi patio is a solid 3 star restaurant . some days the food tastes better than others . and some days the entertainment value is better than others . but it 's not a chain , it 's within walking distance and has very affordable margaritas . there 's no
3 it 's impossible to go wrong on mondays . $ 3 burger and fries ? it 's true . super props to the bistro burger for it 's use of ciabatta bread , angus beef , and perfectly delectable fries . if you come between 3-6 on monday , you
4 i did you a favor . you can thank me later . i have completed an official , side by side comparison and can <unk> say that rainbow donuts beats that other competitor . you know , just think double d 's . no , not those kind . it
4 if you ever have the privilege to eat at miele 's , you are lucky . it 's a small place , with a big taste . my favorite , stuffed tortellini with gorgonzola sauce , it 's not on the menu and it 's so good , you will
4 yes , an option to a harkins theater , hooray !!! <unk> <unk> harkins . anyway , i had a coupon for a medium drink with the purchase of any size popcorn , a great deal . saw the <unk> , very intense . more people need to go to
3 a cool place where thousands of basketball fans can gather , watch the game , and leave without <unk> local traffic for miles like westgate does . came here trashed for a <unk> game , and was happy the seats in row 14 did n't completely suck for someone with
3 lights are flashing . metal is blaring . shots are pouring . lanes are full . and it 's only wednesday night . sure last call for drinks comes at 11:15 , but you want to save your 3am <unk> for at least thursday . bowling is optional to have
2 came here last sunday for a few pints -lrb- $ 3 each ! -rrb- , and i have some highs and lows to share about this place . to steal a word from bud light , the beers here had a lot of `` <unk> '' . my hefeweizen was
2 i have no idea why this place is called `` pranksters '' , but the joke was definitely on me . after being whisked here by an older crowd , i opened the door and thought i was at the wrong place . this could have been an <unk> meeting
3 i heard this is a <unk> station for those homely american apparel models . i heard they charge a cover if you do n't bring a mac . all clientele jokes aside , this really is a place where an average joe like myself can grab , well , an
3 i had a friend from hawaii who said this was `` a lot like home '' , so skeptical me decided to give it a try . keep in mind that i have little to no idea of what constitutes hawaiian food , but i know what i like .
1 i went about trying that happy hour i mentioned a while back . the prices were happy for westgate , i suppose , but still about the same as many other sushi bars throughout the valley . that awesome saketini i raved about last time ? it no longer exists
3 more like `` cougar ranch '' , am i right ? i have a habit of <unk> on saturday nights , but this place has what i need to keep me tipsy and entertained . started off by checking out the live music . people were being lame and just
2 this is the rowdy , <unk> version of rosie mccaffrey 's . with a small bar , and a tiny stage , it 's easily packed to the brim , with raucous customers slamming irish car bombs to the beat of an irish <unk> . nothing about the <unk> selection
3 food was good and plentiful . had breakfast burrito with green chili sauce - pretty darn good . the wait and seating is a crapshoot as some that came after got seated before us .
1 i 'm not really a big fan of getting food that has ingredients that are n't mentioned on the menu . not just my meal but my friends had food that was n't exactly what we ordered .
2 consistent food , nice family atmosphere and spicy pickles . what more could you want ?
3 excellent crust , quality ingredients , nice beer selection , and the pizza is always cooked perfectly .
3 i love zipps ! i have been going to zipps for years mainly to watch sports on one of the many televisions they have playing or for their amazing wings and happy hour . the wings are better grilled too so try them that way !
3 get the wings grilled !! they are so good ! wonderful happy hour with great drinks !
2 i have not eaten anything at the tilted kilt but i want to write a review thanking the staff of the tilted kilt . it was my boyfriend 's birthday on st. patrick 's day and i had paid online for tickets to get in to the street party .
4 5 stars for the special fishes . the wild caught salmon , the ono , and a couple other atypical fish they had this past weekend . it 's been months since i 've been here -lrb- i 'm wondering why it took so long to come back -rrb- .
0 i do n't expect much when grabbing lunch at a mall , but i expect better than this . the seaweed salad was a generic overly soy tasting disappointment , the rainbow roll was barely worth eating - the shrimp on the roll tasted fishy , the fish was <unk>
3 basic <unk> food done well - sounds easy but how often do i actually find that ? i do at <unk> -lrb- yes it 's one word , not too -rrb- . in the last two months since the opening i 've probably been there a dozen or more times
3 pull the car over now !!! that 's what my dear husband <unk> whenever we drive by tammie coe . the first time i tried her cakes was right before our wedding 3 years ago , and i called and begged her to do my cake and she squeezed it
1 the location and atmosphere are tops , service is fine , food is forgettable . i can say this because i ate there about a month ago , and now that i 'm getting around to doing the review i can hardly remember what we had - a rare thing
4 do you know what `` scampi '' really is ? i learned new food fact at marcellino this week , something i should have known , but most of us probably do n't . `` scampi '' is an animal - a type of lobster that looks a lot like
3 there is a special place in my heart for good restaurants in sunnyslope , and bombero 's is right there . i only wish the wine were better priced . considering the fantastic deals for superb wines that can be found at the liquor stores now , the i have
4 wow ... where has this place been all my life ? or at least since i moved to phoenix : -rrb- by far and away the best pie i 've had in the valley . at yelp 's suggestion , we tried out this joint with another couple and we
2 i really do enjoy whole foods and the only reason i do n't do my primary grocery shopping here is because of the expense . however , i frequent wf for their salad and hot bars during lunchtime . again , not cheap but the food is fresh and the
2 we had a great happy hour here . the beer was fantastic and cheap until 6 pm . our black bean burger was average and the service was ok . if we were in the area , we would probably try it again .
2 i think this location obviously has some kinks to work out but otherwise our meal here on opening day was nice . i 'm a big fan of the location in mesa and did n't like the food quite as much at this new store in phoenix . i ca
3 the pizzas we ordered were amazing ... one white pizza and one traditional with basil and tomatoes . both were perfectly cooked and brought to us by a very friendly wait staff . i will definitely come here again .
2 we frequent bj 's on girl 's nights . they have good food , a casual atmosphere and great beer . i would give it a higher rating if their prices were a little lower for the type of cuisine you get . ca n't go wrong with the crispy
3 so happy we live so close to chelsea 's kitchen ! this place is great . fresh food , reasonable prices and a nice ambiance . do n't miss the white sangria , it is refreshing and wonderful to share . the service is usually good although the last time
3 i went here to celebrate my birthday . first let me say this , the service in this place is impeccable . i 've had very few establishments serve me in such fashion and i would be surprised if an establishment could top the quality of the service in kai
2 i 'm taking a tour of old town scottsdale eateries , so i ended up here at that bungalow . my experience here was nice . i genuinely enjoyed every bite of my ahi tuna salad . i ate it all up . the service was nice . the establishment
3 once again , i 'm reminded of a place i visited and that i enjoyed , but allowed to drop off my food radar . i guess for a while i traveled so much last year that it 's not too hard to imagine i 'd forget about a few
2 michael martin murphy might have said `` it 's a long way back to new mexico '' , but in phoenix , you can take a short ride down hayden from old town scottsdale to carlsbad tavern for a great taste of new mexico . this place is really cool
4 if you do n't know how to do it , i 'll show you how to walk the dog ! - <unk> thomas said it waaaaay back when , but i 'm saying it now . i 'll walk a dog and anything else a long way to have one
3 this is a review that has been in the making for quite some time . this review is for the this location . this is a 3.5 star review , but i ca n't give them a 3 . i will cut to the chase and save most of my
3 went back again and the food and price are still good !
1 i have been here for lunch several times . try to get in the door before 12 ; 11:30 if you can . i find the service to be acceptable on most occasions , but that can slow down when the place starts packing up . that goes the same
3 a great place to enjoy a meal outside . the farm was serene and the weather was perfect . the farm monte cristo , a `` french toast sandwich '' with ham and eggs , was very tasty . the french toast was melt in your mouth and the over
4 this is a cozy coffee shop in a strip mall . i went for lunch one day and ordered a sweet crepe with nutella , strawberries , and bananas . it was very good . in addition to the sweet and savory crepes , you can also create your own
4 shady 's is the polar opposite of the kind of bars you will find in scottsdale . it 's dark . it 's small . it has no theme , no slick decor . it 's kind of like the basement of your parents ' house , complete with random
2 one of the more bizarre <unk> i have seen ... why is the place to be after work in scottsdale a restaurant in a mall `` basement '' ? is it the choice view of the parking garage entrance ? the gentle breeze laden with the scent of car exhaust
4 it is a gem . hidden ? literally perhaps . try finding a place to sit during prime hour , though . i really do like this place a lot despite the yuppie crowd . great wine selection . tasty bites . very dark . couches . cool place to
1 cold . bad music -lrb- think cheesy nightclub music aimed at the <unk> aging segment of the population -rrb- . not a good selection of food . not a good selection of wine by the glass . overall , i would say this place has an identity crisis going on
3 it had been a while since i 've been to cherry blossom , so i did n't feel good about reviewing it until i tried it again recently . it was just as good as i remembered . the service is a tad slow and it is pretty smoky inside
4 words can not describe this food . it is a true delight to dine here . authentic upscale mexican food . you will not find chips and salsa here . you will find amazing shrimp dishes , an array of freshly prepared salsas and watermelon juice . cozy , colorful
3 mickey 's rocks . open for <unk> . i have spent many nights here <unk> trying to sober up by downing sweet potato fries , sliders , and other choice hangover treats . it 's totally divey , full of <unk> couches , and people having a good old time
1 this is not good asian food . the veggie stir fry was terrible . the rice was <unk> . the hot and sour soup was very good - a bright spot on the menu . if i was ever forced to come here again , i would order that .
3 come here for new mexico style mexican cuisine . think hot hot hot . red or green . pick your poison . the rellenos are great . i have no idea what <unk> is talking about - as far as i know there is only one other los dos is
3 this is a delightful little place for a glass of wine and bite to eat after work . i finally stopped last friday and was charmed . lisa g herself poured my glass and chatted me up . i enjoyed some dessert . it was quite good . lunch is
4 my all time favorite spot . best sunset in the valley . <unk> views and decor . amazing martinis . excellent food . i do n't usually order seafood in the desert but the scallops here were amazing . when i ate here in may i saw mario <unk> leaving
4 ** now open for sunday brunch ** 8 am - 3 pm this is a true neighborhood cafe with fresh food at <unk> prices . acacia cafe just opened and i could n't be happier . it is easy to miss , sandwiched between an italian restaurant and a retail
3 i shop here every weekend . even though i feel as though whole foods has lost some of its original <unk> since turning into a giant national chain it is still better than anyplace else to shop . you will always find a nice selection of organic foods and groceries
1 it 's pf changs . it 's generic americanized asian food . what else is there to say .
2 food is ok and the beer selection is pretty typical for a sports bar . the chicken `` focaccia '' sandwiches are ok . they are n't made with the traditional italian focaccia bread but rather more like a middle eastern flatbread or wrap . happy hour selections are pretty
2 been here twice and not sure if i 'll return . the first time i came here was for a massage . the second for a facial . the massage was ok , however , the facial was not . the facilities were decent with a good fitness center but
3 more like 3.5 stars this is their 2nd location with the 1st in old town scottsdale . there is n't much to the decor but it 's pretty clean and the food is consistent . while they need more hired and seasoned help the staff is friendly and do what
3 this place lives up to its reputation and i always leave <unk> . one of my favorite places to go for good subs , italian cured meats , and antipasto . while it 's setup as a mini market / deli , the market offerings are a little pricier than
1 this is going to be simple and <unk> : if you have <unk> then come here . if you do n't want to go to old town and feel old then come here . or if you do n't want to go to north scottsdale and see a lot of
3 yay ! it 's not another starbucks ! how come it took so long for a coffee shop to open in this retail center ? good coffee , friendly service , and a few treats as well . wish it was a bit bigger with more seating but i 'll
2 fun place for a few beers and live music . it 's a big space with a <unk> room in the back for some good entertainment . i 've heard mixed reviews on the food from good to meh but both times i stopped in were for the liquid meals
2 had an hour to grab lunch during a training , and we ended up here . napoli pizza was decent , and the <unk> salad was tasty , but the price was a little ridiculous for the amount of food . having a time limit was also a little tough
2 huh , so i 'm clearly in the minority with this review . after hearing about this place repeatedly , i was excited to give it a try . end result was a `` meh '' . for 6 of us , the total was $ <unk> . holy crap
3 really ? who has n't eaten at oregano 's ? consistently yummy -- the meatballs are good -lrb- better out of the sub though -rrb- , sandwiches are good , and the salads are delicious ! the vino bambino -lrb- or something close to that -rrb- was super yummy !
2 good affordable gyros
3 good service with good pricing for both dry cleaning and laundry services .
3 friendly staff long happy hour til 9pm live music , great specialty happy hr drinks and apps . plus a secret room behind the <unk> .
1 had dinner there the other day . again - i love the design and atmosphere . service was good but the food ... not worth the $ $ $ they are asking for . starting with the kids option - i ordered the pasta with marinara sauce which the server
1 food was not good ... and we were hungry ! deco is outdated . service was good . but really the food was tasteless and not appealing .
3 this place is great . the owner is very nice and friendly . the mediterranean sandwich was amazing and the omelets look fantastic . i will definitely go there again and try their breakfast sandwich .
4 probably the best sushi in town . fresh fish - always ! -lrb- not easy in az -rrb- we always enjoy the strong drinks . not much changes in the menu and the specials repeat , so i would like to see more creativity but overall i love this place
4 i was <unk> to try this place out . a new <unk> / healthy restaurant in phoenix is this girls dream come true ! first of all , i loved the decor and ambiance . put wheat grass plants in any restaurant and i love it ! i had the
2 lots of bad reviews but i like this place as i frequent it once every couple weeks . i eat sushi out about 3 days a week so i run out of places to go . i went last night . they changed their menu ! at least the looks
4 i am `` dragged '' to this place at least once every 2 weeks by my `` dining partner '' who loves their steaks . being the vegetarian that i am , i have never had one but i can find plenty on the menu to eat . -lrb- i
2 it was very quite when we went on a sunday afternoon with our groupon . ordered the ham and brie and greek salad . it was good but i am not sure good enough to make me want to seek it out again - sorry
3 we have tried various dog parks in phx and found this to be the best . the dogs are separated into active and passive and the place is always well maintained and will be shut if there has been heavy rain or anything to let the place recover . the
0 went with a groupon - probably the most disappointed i have been with one . i am not sure what i had as it did not resemble what i had ordered -lrb- i thought anyway -rrb- and it was tasteless . i just wanted to be done and really did
2 came in for desert . service was terrible . ice-cream was good , but was it better than what i can get at a diary queen - i am not so sure . nostalgic atmosphere for sure , but not a lot else going for it , sorry
3 this is an easy place to pick for lunch with my work friends . they offer a nice selection of salads where even a half order is too much for one person - like other reviewers , the caramelized peach is my favorite . artichoke and spinach dip is always
4 wow , where to begin ... very nice ambiance with glass walls to break up the interior sections . we sat in the room to the rear of the piano bar and could hear each other just fine - it was very crowded and i did see groups with kids
2 rosemary roasted nuts - sweet and nice . fondue - a little <unk> , bread was toasted a little too much but the sausage was wonderful . burrata - if you only get one thing , this should be it . short rib - presented on the bone with a
0 want to experience one of the most poorly run chains in scottsdale ... look no further than this p.f. chang 's !!! placed a take out order over an hour in advance and still had to wait 50 minutes for the order once i got there . sat and watched
1 this place is frustrating - i 've had a pretty decent food and service but mostly both are terrible . i 've been here quite a few times , always in a pinch when i wanted to grab falafel that was close to the house ... they never seem to
3 friendly staff , great atmosphere , and adequate food . plus , cider and guiness on tap !
3 food is hit or miss . best aspects of this place are the appetizers and drinks . great atmosphere , even has an outdoor <unk> . awesome for happy hour !
0 i used to like lola until i learned the owner is a <unk> pig . i will never visit again !
2 i did n't eat the pizza , so i ca n't comment there . i sampled three dishes . my friend ordered eggplant parmesean , and that was tasty , but i 've had better . my husband and i both ordered pasta dishes . the pasta itself was ok
4 love this place ! went last night for the <unk> and it was amazing with the chihuly exhibit going on .
3 my recommendations : golden medium wings , monaco focaccia , and the half & half sides of onion rings / fries . they always run specials for happy hour and depending on the day they have specific plates on specials . you can go wrong with this sports bar .
4 favorite mexican food in phoenix , arizona hands down .
3 seems weird to order wings at an italian joint but they 're amazing !!! have never had a bad meal at oreganos !
2 my rating is actually more in the range of 3.5 . went here for a birthday dinner with friends and was really impressed by ambience and service . the server was very knowledgeable about the food -lrb- at times i felt i was listening to the chef or critics on
2 in my search for trivia nights , i visited the place this tuesday . place wasnt too crowded , not sure its the norm . the food was decent and service was ok . the place can be difficult to find in the complex . the trivia was fun ,
3 it should be no surprise that the ambience and service at this restaurant located inside a 5 star resort is impeccable . what is <unk> though is that the food is good as well . what was even better of course was that i wasnt paying for it : -rrb-
3 i tried dry bar for the first time this weekend to get my <unk> , <unk> hair look respectable for a friend 's baby shower . -lrb- hey , the only single girl at the party needs to look smashing , right ? -rrb- i was impressed from the get
2 this restaurant marks my first experience with french cuisine -lrb- well if we do n't count melting pot -rrb- and i came out reasonably <unk> . the restaurant is tucked in a corner and can be hard to find and is literally ` petite ' . that makes for a
3 if i could give it a 4.5 i would . not much not to be unhappy about here . the good : food was great . fresh . delicious . served hot . lovely and i split the <unk> skewers . delicious , perfect size served with a touch of
3 have to agree with the other yelpers here ... food is fresh ; bread is amazing . i 'm a fan of the turkey blt especially -lsb- sourdough bread , grilled carved turkey , applewood smoked bacon , romaine , roasted tomato and paprika mayo ! -rsb- the pesto pizza
0 just . kill . me . now . <unk> parking - even middle of the day ! ridiculous to get around and so crowded it gives me hives . i will travel to the petsmart on elliott rather than here just to avoid it . will bring small child to
2 let me say first off , that i 'm a cheese lover . daughter of tried and true new england types , there aint nothin ' better than extra sharp vermont cheddar or my swiss brother in law 's homemade fondue . so when my <unk> ex and i got
4 great , great , great . fabulous location -lsb- in my work ` hood -rsb- , wonderful building , capable and friendly staff and the usual <unk> food . was so glad to know that this very fine sibling is close to work and just as good as the arcadia
3 nice little zoo . the monkey house is pretty awesome ! the haunted zoo thing during halloween is fun !
4 this my favorite asian food place in north phoenix ! i have n't had anything that was n't delicious and fresh . even the take-out rocked !
3 nice dark bar in the late afternoon for a nice little happy hour : -rrb-
4 go to place if you want to <unk> late . on the weekends they -lrb- mostly -rrb- do not close at all . on week nights they 're open late . if you chain smoke , sit outside . it 's nice . if you do n't , sit inside
2 i 'll say that my experiences here are n't as bad as other reviewers , but i am here for one thing . photography . they have better lighting than some of the other local places around here . as others have pointed out , to watch the show ,
3 bj 's is fun if you 're with a buddy and need a quick bite before a movie over at harkin 's . the beer is made on the premises and is really good , they got a ton of huge tvs , sitting at the bar is a good
4 i was walking by here today and some saw friends eating out front . they welcomed me over to share lunch with them . i 'd been planning on another place but as soon as i saw the pastrami i was hooked . i got in a short line -lrb-
2 i 've been to grimaldi 's and loved them but we 'd not been to this location . we were first told that we could not sit on the patio because too many people were out there -lrb- it was half full maybe -rrb- . so we sat near the
3 i was here recently for an event . we had the beer and pretzels . i did not have dinner . the back patio was so awesome here . the owner was out there for our event and was very friendly . the pretzels were so awesome and the sauce
4 i do n't think i have ever had a bad experience at bs west and if i did i ca n't remember it ; -rrb- the best days are wednesday and saturday where the drinks are 2 4 1 . and these are n't weak drinks either . there are
3 i have been wanted to go to chompie 's forever and now that i am leaving phoenix , i felt like it was necessary to try it out . i had to try the jewish sliders that i had seen on man v food . obviously , i did n't
3 i ca n't provide a comprehensive review of the urban grocery and wine bar , but i definitely enjoyed what i saw this wednesday . markets usually scare me because i do n't know how to shop for food . luckily , i went there with some friends for wine
3 i have a hard time <unk> rosie from seamus . well , one is in walking distance and one requires that i drive . their menus are essentially the same with rosie being a little more americanized and seamus more irish . rosie 's claim to fame in my book
2 delux , you are the <unk> of burger restaurants . i say this because of the <unk> for gay clientele to fill your swank space . also because the overwhelming desire to be trendy and coming across as trying to hard seems to fit as well . that being said
3 these are the items you should sample at ticoz : - blood orange mojito . do not dare to get another drink because it will be a mistake . - corn tamales with shrimp . mix the tamales with the shrimp and some beans on your fork . - carnitas
2 i started coming to this la fitness when i stopped working over in scottsdale . it gets super crowded during the after work hours and i would n't recommend going then . which is a drag because that is the preferable time to go , which is why it is
2 first of all , i do n't find photographs of significant us history offensive - i mean scratch is n't hanging a <unk> flag or anything , i think the previous reviewers need to calm down . i had a light lunch in scratch today , asparagus <unk> with a
3 for me , eating is all about texture and flavors and frozen yogurt is one of my favorite summertime treats for its cool creaminess . mmmm . i stopped in to yogurtland two weeks ago and at 3 in the afternoon it was packed with children -lrb- yuck , minus
2 this place is disgusting . i would have lived a long happy life not having entered loco patron . the crowd is creepy alcoholics , douchey <unk> stereotypes , frat boys and sad , hysterical <unk> . the inside is so dark you can barely see the person opposite you
2 yay for yelp blind dates ! today i met up with <unk> d and gabi k for a ladies lunch at j alexander 's . being relatively new to the area -lrb- as in ... today -rrb- i was not aware that it was a chain , and i 'll
4 after dim <unk> at the chinese cultural complex and the great wall in phoenix , i feel confident declaring this the valley winner for dim sum . i 've been here a number of times over the years and have had a delicious experience each time . the key is
3 i finally made my way to the market and al-hana yesterday for a lunchtime feast . i ordered way too much for myself and 2 co-workers but everything was just as i remember from my childhood -lrb- of eating things most other kids would n't -rrb- . i thought the
3 this is a combined review of elements and jade bar , because i spent 6 hours here recently on an indulgent day of eating and drinking . two of us met for lunch on a thursday at 12:30 , and were almost entirely alone in the restaurant for the <unk>
3 wow , used clothes that do n't smell like old people or <unk> ... where am i ? oh , my sister 's closet , that 's where . i did n't have much time to scour the racks when i was here the other day , but here are
4 great supermarket ... has most foods that you need from around the world at really good prices
3 real thai food . great drunken noodle . prices are very reasonable . it 's not a `` fancy '' or trendy looking place , but if you 're looking for very good food at an affordable price , look no further .
3 4.5 stars ... best pizza in phoenix and probably the best tiramisu i 've ever eaten . i tried bianco , and did n't care for it . tried cibo and found it much better . however , in my opinion , this beats cibo because of the pizza crust
4 this is the 2nd best sushi in scottsdale , without being overpriced and over <unk> by $ 3 million decor , like most of the boring <unk> restaurants in snotsdale that <unk> with money to burn go to get drunk . they have japanese chefs , and they give you
2 inside the $ 200 + / night downtown phoenix hyatt hotel , this is the casual dining watering hole for the hotel where mostly out-of-town <unk> grab a bite and stiff one . it has a bar and tables with tvs inside , and a reasonable sized covered patio outside
3 i used to live in snotsdale , and this was the premiere shopping mall for that town with endless shopping choices . at least for the <unk> <unk> types who sought brand names and designer boutiques . or lived too far away from kierland commons to come down here .
1 so , we received at $ 20 off coupon in the mail and decided to give it a try . let 's just say ... it 's been some months since then and we have n't been back ... the only time this place has popped up on my radar
4 where do i begin ? this place is amazing ! i have been many times , and each time i try a new dessert and am always pleased . they have tsoynami 's -lrb- think vegan blizzard -rrb- , an assortment of <unk> pastries , <unk> beverages , and more
4 i have found my new favorite veg friendly restaurant ! first off , everything is organic and as local as possible . they do n't have any mock meats , just pure food . they have salads , wraps , soup , desserts , starters , and entrees . everything
4 i recently moved closer to this area and have been wanting to give luci 's a try . as soon as i walked in i was greeted by two super friendly barista 's , <unk> and emily . being my first time here , they were both really awesome helping
3 ok , i 'm torn . i dig this the atmosphere , with its trendy vibe and blue lights and the super rad lamp at the end of the bar . the drinks are very tasty , and happy hour lasts until 6:30 . i usually get the red sangria
3 ok , so i have seen groupons for this place for quite some time now , so i decided to give in and see what it was all about . we were greeted by a super friendly host who was quick to help us to our table . our server
1 my girlfriend i and had both enjoyed meals here before , so we were happy to return for some tasty food and great service . let 's just say it 's not quite what we remembered . we were seated and it took several minutes for a server to come
4 so , i have recently decided to try my hand at <unk> . i always enjoyed hitting up the scottsdale location of green , but was overjoyed to hear that they had opened one minutes away from my house . i really love that it 's not typical -lrb- from
3 i have to admit , i do n't really get the pay by the ounce fro-yo craze . it 's partly because i like to be served -lrb- ex . b : i hated those cook your own steak places -rrb- and partly because i do n't really see the
3 i 'm happy i <unk> my fear of community tables and finally made it in for dinner . turns out , not all of the tables are big 8 <unk> and maybe i can be more social . the tuck shop is the perfect small , local , friendly eatery
3 solid , adult option on mill that offers you a chance to dine among the younger set without feeling like a dirty old man or woman ... but , do n't stare too long , because you can still cross the line if you do n't check your <unk> <unk>
2 above average decor , but only average burger and fries . i went here for lunch and while having a beer and watching the tvs over the bar seemed like a great idea , that was not to be on this day . -lrb- they have a good cocktail list
3 the lost leaf is not scottsdale , or mill , in fact that is just the start of the great things about this place . it is a casual , grungy , down-to-earth place with rotating art , local indie bands , and one of the best beer selections in
1 ok , this is now based on food ... mostly . i went back to rnr based on an invitation from rnr , unfortunately , the follow through was lacking . without getting into details ... it may be that i had to ask for things when in fact i
3 why did it take me so long to come here ?? i 've heard about delux since it opened and finally made it here . i quickly browsed over the menu and saw they have a `` delux burger . '' namesake = order . so i did . along
2 blue hound . oh how i want to love you . i 've stayed at the palomar in san francisco and was so excited they built one here . i figured the blue hound had to be awesome . the decor is what i expected . super hip with a
3 since the zinburger was offering a 2 for $ 30 restaurant week menu and my bff and i have been wanting to try this place for a while , we popped in for our bff date night . there was a wait for two ; but since there were seats
4 this place is great . expect a bit of a wait during lunch time because it will be busy . there 's only a few tables inside this small restaurant so i recommend take out if you can . one of the best gyros i 've had and definitely the
2 for $ <unk> , i got a `` little bacon cheeseburger '' , fries , and a drink i refilled at least 4 times to make myself believe i got my money 's worth today . the burger was good . it reminds me of what burgers taste like when
3 mmmmmmm pizza . we came here for girlfriend lunch on a tuesday and sat at a table in the bar . it was n't as busy as i thought it would be at lunchtime near the busy biltmore business area . the space is beautiful , keeping true to many
3 lots of famous people have eaten here and there 's thank you notes written all over the white <unk> walls to prove it , along with hand written menus on the walls . i came here after watching the best i ever ate on the food network . so maybe
4 delicious food , great wine . if you like <unk> , try their half bottle of <unk> .
3 pretty fun spot . there is live music in the downstairs area , and a club in the upstairs area . good for groups with different tastes .
4 roka akor is amazing . the sashimi is fresh and perfectly cut . the desserts are also perfection . blue fin tuna flight was their special tonight and it was so delicious that i took a moment to close my eyes and indulge in the moment of the melting fresh
4 delicious ! order the risotto . that 's all i can really tell you because that 's the only entree i 've had here , but i have n't found a need to try anything else . and that 's big coming from me because i usually love to try
2 want sushi fast without the fast food taste ? try sushi station . i have gone to sushi station several times and i have consistently enjoyed their rolls . are they something to write home about ? no , but it is a solid lunch place with great , quick
4 upward projects does it again . this place is in my top five favorite places to go in central phoenix . the atmosphere is great , many pieces including the benches outside came from modern <unk> which is a vintage store i frequent as well . what is critical to
3 i have been a fan of chino for a few years now , right before they hit the popularity of ddd . if you are looking for a total ddd experience in the phoenix area , this is the place . the food is absolutely incredible and the flavors it
3 i have been going to sushi brokers for two to three years now and it is one of my solid picks for rolls . the happy hour definitely offers a variety of rolls and spirits at a discounted price . the service is great . i see this place a
2 very good service . cute inside and nice patio .
3 we had a nice meal here for a sunday night . would be interesting to come back when it 's more of a `` club '' . the pesto edamame was different and good .
4 this place is consistently wonderful . we had our rehearsal dinner here and it was incredibly well run .
1 expensive and just ok .
1 sat at the sushi bar ; it was like sitting at a table alone , you ca n't see the fish to determine freshness , etc. , what i usually do at a sushi bar . this is a very pricey place for what you get , the nigiri are
2 one of the tastiest burgers in phx , very good service , but the food can be inconsistent . very good atmosphere , with all the flat screen tvs , but a couple of recent visits showed `` all the good seats '' taken , pushing us to the rear

4 found this place on accident looking for a new sandwich place downtown . i have been here quite a few times , and for 7 $ getting a huge sandwich is quite the deal . highly recommend it , just get their early because this place fills up at lunch
1 my sister and i ended up here after first friday last night , and i was surprised to find that the place was n't packed like every other bar down town . one sip of my drink , however , and it all made sense . hanny 's is a

1 dear breadfruit , we became acquainted on the internet , like so many <unk> these days do , and i must admit that i became fascinated with you quickly . your menu sang to me with so many tasty words , and your location could n't be better . we
3 i eat here often . i too ca n't imagine what day stephanie came in here . the place is always moderately busy that i have seen . i have stopped in at lunch , and dinner , and right before close . the ingredients are fresh , no frozen
3 i have been here twice , both times during happy hour , and i have to say that i disagree with most of the reviews here . first off - i did valet my car . a 2004 <unk> sedona . there were people there with nice cars , but
4 all i can say is wow . first impression was the music . thank you for the volume level . loud enough to enjoy , not loud enough to overwhelm our conversation . to many places these days that play something other than elevator music crank it up so loud
2 so i went here after church with some friends . i can honestly say , yes spinato 's is good , but this one is not as good as the one on bell . i really enjoy the pizza here . my one complaint is , the thick crust pizza
3 great food , good date night type place . i wish i wrote this review earlier , my wife and i went here awhile ago and to be honest i do n't remember much about the food besides the fact that we both got different sandwiches they had . it
2 nothing special . i got the shrimp taco , it was pretty good for what it was . they had the right concept where it needed to be crispy and not soggy . which is always important . in the end the place was way over priced for not high
3 yes . b-day dinner ... it was good . all the sandwiches my table had were delicious . i went with my family so i got to try everyone 's food -lrb- thats how we roll -rrb- . all the sandwiches had delicious and fresh ingredients . i got the

4 i was honestly having a hard time deciding if i should give them 4 or 5 stars . i am going to swing the 5 stars because leftovers were equally as good the day after . this place is cafeteria style restaurant . which is good , you see your
3 this place is a fun and great concept . i did n't like how everything were slider styles . so if i could i would rank this 3.5 but we ca n't so i rounded it up because the <unk> was great . to be honest trying out all their
1 the shaved ice is unique and good . the ambiance and service lacking ... would i come back ? no ... not even if i was craving it because service sucks ... rude wan na be 's here . i 'd give 1 star but that would n't be fair
3 people that work <unk> the place are very very nice and considerate . their cookies speak for themselves , they are yum , i love their ice cream cookie -lrb- only available in the summer -rrb- too bad they do n't come with other cookies . this place deserves going
3 fun place . drinks are pretty <unk> pricey . stick to the beer and your wallet will be okay . they have things to do here though which is awesome ! drinking beer , playing a number of games like cornhole , shuffle board , ping pong . who can
4 i absolutely love the creamy white rice from revo . do n't get me wrong , the rest of the food is yummy too , but not as yummy as that rice , if i could get a giant tub of the rice to take home , i would .
4 we went here with a $ 25 certificate from restaurant.com and this place is amazing , i have been back twice since we first tried it a week prior . we had the cubano sliders , the empanadas , the pernil asado tacos , the short rib barbacoa tacos and
4 i love this place ! it 's where i first discovered my love of sushi , i had eaten sushi before , but nothing quite as amazing as the vegas roll i had here , and i am obsessed with it , it is the best i have ever had
4 absolutely awesome . the brie brle was so delicious . i am hooked
2 it ok but not great and service is so so .
4 best coffee shop in scottsdale hands down
4 awesome food , atmosphere , and drinks . we ate in the downstairs bar and loved it . i had the new mexican platter . you should try it soon .
4 very nice interior . i love the bar with oyster shooters and the deli and lobster tank ! i 'm aware of what fish have the highest mercury , which are substituted and which are lying low on the <unk> list . i know what water areas are most <unk>
4 it has been about 3 years since i last visited and it took me this long and a few people to say good things about them before i could return . my last visit was reminiscent of cheaply made sushi and bland food . the green tea fried ice cream

1 this place used to be my favorite sushi place when i first started going about 9 years ago . as the years go by , the quality , freshness , and taste of the food has failed to please . i used to recommend this place to friends and visitors

4 this is one stop shopping for indie music fans . they have listening stations where you can preview new releases . the selection of used cds is large and could easily take up your whole afternoon . i always find something i 've been searching for when i go in
2 cool vibe , nice servers , sweet decor , decent -lrb- emphasis on decent , not <unk> ! -rrb- food . not amazing . but worth a trip to see and be seen : -rrb- sit at the bar and it will make you feel hip .
3 a true big city deli - huge sandwiches and endless combinations . even the servers seemed `` new york '' -lrb- one of them was definitely packing a gun ? -rrb- . they have several flavorful vegetarian sandwiches as well as the standard meat offerings ! the atmosphere was also
4 i went back to copper star today . i ordered a vegan apple cinnamon muffin , which was much better than the pastry i had last time . the cinnamon was oozing out of it and i never would have guessed it was vegan ! the staff was also super
3 ding ! approved . okay okay , it 's not cibo or bianco . but really , should you be expecting that ? given the price , speed and great service , this place is absolutely worth it . the staff is young , friendly , energetic and welcoming .
4 i ca n't help but love this place . i 've been going here since , quite literally , the day the opened . i move further away and i keep coming back . the staff is friendly , the food is delicious , the beer selection constantly rotates to

4 best coffee in the valley , let alone tempe . they roast their own beans on site -lrb- roasting days are heaven -rrb- . at any given moment they 'll have a dozen different beans available , and they 'll offer you advice on which you might like based on

4 oh junkie , what can i say about a place that once hosted midget wrestling besides ... i love you ! this is one of my favorite places just because it 's not quite as snobby as scottsdale locales can be . there 's three different bars which comes in
4 i think it 's pretty evident from all the rave reviews that this place is really good so i 'll keep it brief . i 'd heard about this place forever and the bottle of win and bruschetta deal but i had n't actually been until monday night with a
4 best place for day drinking ! i 've spent way too many days people watching and drinking myself into a stupor here but it 's so much fun that i do n't even mind ! there 's definitely a large showing of the typical scottsdale crowd but mixed in there
3 <unk> , it had been a while . went down on a wednesday night , and it was perfect for a second date . the background music was at the perfect level for conversation and the staff was friendly . while i 'm still sad that they took my favorite
4 i started going to their original location in tempe , and let me tell you - they lost nothing by expanding . if you like middle eastern food , this is a great place to try out - with more of a fast food then full on dining experience .

3 i love their pizzas and now they have pastas , and they 're awesome too ! i still prefer postino 's bruschetta ... but i ca n't seem to put my finger on why . i think it might be the bread ...
4 went to the mission today for a nice saturday brunch some old people relatives of mine were in town , so we made reservations and all together we were 10 people . the server was super sweet , food came out quick , drinks were refilled , the manager stopped
3 i 'd go back . i do n't eat burgers , so i <unk> for a grilled chicken sandwich ... was pretty damn tasty . my <unk> part is the self help bar with toppings and all the various dips ! i helped myself to quite a bit of nacho

2 i thought this place was fun found the food to be very heavy i got the buffalo burger with the recommended preparation and a beef burger with cheese and foie gras ! the foie gras was just ok . they overly pan seared it . but hey , $ 6
3 the service was good . the atmosphere was a bit loud , but there was a polka band playing not too far away from our table : -rrb- the food was great ! the sausage sampler was excellent the <unk> schnitzel was delicious the <unk> was amazing , plentiful ,

3 great time with great friends . as soon as you walk into this place , there are no waitstaff , seating hostess , or a welcome crew for that matter . it 's a sit down at any table you want type of restaurant and the <unk> will eventually see

3 delicious sandwiches and soups . i 'm surprised that this place is priced about the same as subway and <unk> yet their food is way better . interior is a bit boring but hey who cares about that when you have good food ! * if you join lunch club
3 i ate here last night . overall i had a good experience . despite it being in the middle of summer the outdoor seating was comfortable . dogs are allowed outside and the waiter -lrb- possible owner -rrb- is as french as can get it . he was very attentive
4 great place to go on a nice sunny phoenix day . be sure to bring a <unk> or football to throw around and have one of the delicious soups and sandwiches . most locals do n't know about this place and i am ok with that since it already gets

3 great food for a decent price that should easily get 5 stars if it was n't for the insane amount of wait time . my group showed up 15 minutes early for a group reservation and still had to wait 60 minutes , ridiculous ! everything i had was delicious
3 i went here last tuesday for my 25th wedding anniversary . i had been looking forward to visiting j & g ever since they took over from mary elaine 's . we arrived at our designated reservation time of 7:00 pm but the restaurant was not very full . it

3 came here on a saturday morning and already a line was forming out the door . while waiting to be seated , people kept pouring in . i 'm thinking `` man this place must be good ! '' the wait was n't too long but food took a while
3 seems more like a bar & restaurant rather than a quick stop for a bite . i was surprised when i walked in . the first thing i saw was the bar which were occupied by rather well dressed good looking people . bar has 4 flat screen tv 's
1 the wings were disappointing ; not crispy and just okay . that is all i tried . it was a take out and the service was good . that 's all i got to say right now .
1 food just okay nothing special . as a lunch that is okay , for dinner not . the staff customer service is mixed . been there twice and the hostess in the front was terrific , the bartender was cool , the waitress - oh no !
3 wanted some sushi quick and fresh . went here today and the wonderful lady making the sushi create my order in no time and exactly the way i ordered . delicious - had salmon , tuna , mackerel and eel , added a mixed roll of the same fish .
0 their coffee is one of the best places i 've been to but they made me wait 30 minutes for mine . they should have given me a heads before i bought it .
4 i came here during restaurant week and i ordered a bacon wrapped filet mignon with shrimp and scallops . came with an appetizer of buttered shrimp and a dessert -lrb- i ordered crme brule but they did n't have it so i picked carrot cake -rrb- . the buttered shrimp

2 dine-in : 3 stars take-out : 4 stars overall it would be about a 3.5 stars this is an italian grocery and restaurant which is pretty neat . the sandwiches are usually very good and they have killer focaccia bread . i would definitely call in your order to go
2 pretty sure most people have eaten at a chipotle at some point . so this review is for location instead of the food , which is pretty consistently good if you want burritos and guacamole . this location is close so i go quite a bit . it tends to

4 there is n't much to add on this place . it 's just a really awesome ice cream shop . that is way different than anything else around here . the popsicles actually have pieces of the ingredients in them so you are n't wondering if it 's just over
1 i tried this place out based on the many reviews . i seemed to have gone on a bad day or maybe they had a new cook . the man behind the counter was very nice and helped us pick out something from the menu while we made up our

2 look , i know it 's a chain ... but the menu is huge -lrb- no way they do n't have something that strikes your fancy on that thing -rrb- and the food is all pretty good . a big plus , for me , is that they recently opened
4 if you drink alcohol and have n't found this place yet ... shame on you ! i 'm always looking to try new stuff ... so they 're literally on <unk> in my phone so they can order it in for me whenever someone says , `` hey i had
1 when this place first opened under new ownership earlier this year , we visited and loved it ! we 're not huge fans of the <unk> ... but these folks did it right at the time ... . fast , hot , delicious and <unk> and shouting at the end
2 it 's a little pricey for what you get ... and it 's not all that authentic . i do realize that arizona folks are mostly clueless as to authentic greek -lrb- as evidenced by the great comments regarding their gyros , falafel , hummus , etc. . . -rrb-
3 was in the area helping a buddy move a motorcycle he 's got up for sale -lrb- i 've got a bike trailer -rrb- and used the yelp <unk> app to find the highest rated bar nearby . this place was it ! first bad thing was ... . where

4 my friends and i are currently devouring our 8oz . cups of gelato . the girl at the counter -lrb- we did n't catch her name , but she rocked ! -rrb- quickly greeted us and helped us with the gelato experience . she willingly gave us samples of everything
3 i had lunch with a coworker here a few weeks ago and i really enjoyed it . it 's one of those places that i 've heard a lot about but have just never been . we were luckily able to grab a parking spot at kirkland and waited in
3 finally had a chance to order off of their full menu . they were at the miller market one thursday and my bf and i stopped by for dinner . i had the moki with no tomatoes and my bf had the oliver -lrb- i think -rrb- and we shared
2 we were planning to eat elsewhere before but since they were full , we decided to eat at <unk> . we were seated right away and our server was very nice and attentive . we started off with the hummus -lrb- i think jalapeno -rrb- and then each got our
2 ~ 3.5 i was wanting to take my bf out to brat haus , but after reading the reviews decided to let it season up a bit . looking for places near old town , i read about carlsbad tavern and since i have a new <unk> to green chile
2 came here for dinner about a week ago . everything on the menu looks really good , and we decided to share a <unk> pizza as it sounded pretty delish . nothing was remarkable about the pizza . i could n't tell you if everything listed on the menu actually
3 charr hosted our company holiday party last night and it was fantastic ! <unk> and joe were great to work with and everything exceeded my expectations . they have a <unk> package , so we had the restaurant to ourselves for the evening , and <unk> was great working with
3 went here for a date night a few weeks ago , and i was surprised to see that it took the spot of what was once l & l bbq . it 's sort of a weird set up for a sushi restaurant , but it looks like they are
3 as much as i love cpc , i ca n't bump it up to 5-stars . i went with a fair group of friends monday night and expected it to be busy and came to terms that we 'd probably have to sit on the patio . suprisingly , all
2 i met a friend here for sushi yesterday . i 've passed by it a million times but that was the first time i had gone . when i walked in i felt like it smelled a little funny , but that went away once we were in the dining
2 i was a little wary about meeting a friend here after work because of the reviews , but i guess they are true to their word , arriba 's was a-ok . we were seated at around 4:45 pm -lrb- on a tues. -rrb- and there was n't too many
3 my first visit here was yesterday morning for a fundraiser - we had the place to ourselves until about noon . i had very little interaction with the staff , but getting my shoes and ball was a quick process . the location was very clean and the equipment did
1 after driving around for awhile to find a place to eat without a wait , i ended up at pei wei with james c. i discovered that they revamped the menu entirely . now you pick a protein and a sauce . no more combos : -lrb- i decided to
3 this is n't the first time i 've frequented this cracker <unk> , but my and my friends passed up chompie 's for some good ole cb . we were seated quickly , and it was pretty poppin ' as it was a saturday morning . ordered the usual ,
3 had drinks and apps here while waiting for a table next door . it was my first time here and we saddled up to the bar for about an hour or so . i tried two drinks -lrb- side car and red dragon ? -rrb- which were not my go-to
2 my friend raved about cheba hut the other night and as i was starving on my way home from work a few days ago , i decided to swing by since it 's on the way . they have a vast menu and after looking at it for a few
2 my manager and i came here for dinner on a monday night while she was in town . i had never been here before , but had passed by it many times and was excited to try . we arrived around 6:30 and there was n't a wait for our
3 i am kind of surprised at all of the sub-par reviews i read on here before going to the improv tonight , but i have to guess that they improved a lot of things because i did n't have much to complain about . my friend and i bought tickets
3 my brothers friend 's family owns this place so of course i think it 's great . i have been here with my family and we had a fun time . the concept of farrelli 's is to enjoy a movie while eating dinner . as a person who plans
3 sauce is just my pace . it 's a relaxed atmosphere where you order the food from a counter and it is brought to your table when it is ready . they offer pizza , tasty salads , panini 's , and pastas . i have only tried the pizza
4 this g spot is far less crowded than the one on scottsdale rd. . there is also a bigger patio partially because the coffee plantation is right next door . here are my favorite flavors so far : there are alot by the way ... a fruity side and the
4 opa ! five stars for this greek eatery ! i never knew i liked greek food until i tried my big fat greek restaurant . i was brought her once by a friend , and after sampling her <unk> i was in love ! <unk> is a baked pita with
3 my mom is obsessed with this place ! needless to say i 've been force fed carlos most of my life , but you know what it 's pretty good ! there is nothing super special about this place , but the food is reliably good so i like that
3 great casual burger joints with a little more class than a drive through . they customize your burger just the way you want in front of you and the huge fries are really yummy too . i do n't eat a lot of fast food , but i would trust
3 came here on a first date and it was perfect ! just enough people but small intimate atmosphere . we both ordered wine that our waitress catered to our pallets and we also shared the cheese and fruit plate yumm ! there was no jazz that night , but there
2 boo this mall sucks ! fiesta mall is no fiesta , my friends . very small , under a lot of construction , and full of small chains everywhere . i would n't have high expectations for this place , and then you wo n't be disappointed . all the
3 great place for salads and sandwiches and the generally `` healthy '' feel . i 've had all the salads and a couple of the sandwiches ... the only complaint i had was there were way too many chipotles in the arizona salad and it way <unk> the taste of
2 it 's ok ... others rant and rave about the place , but i 've tried the sushi and i 've tried the teppan at different times , even years apart and i just was n't that thrilled . the booth seats smelled moldy during my teppan experience ... so
3 this was interesting . came here specifically to try the alligator for mothers day . prices ok ... not ridiculous . cheap down home tables . did n't expect anything else . easy dress code . alligator is cool . tastes pretty yummy . can order your items blackened .
3 for having a `` normal '' experience at one of the other locations , this one was great . i do believe that the layout of this location is excellent . the massive tvs are a huge plus . i was totally <unk> ' that at my bar seat ,
3 the chipotle eggs benedict was excellent . if i had a bigger stomach , i would have eaten all of it . the sauce was amazing , and it had cilantro . everything is better with cilantro . service was good and friendly . this place seemed a little more
4 it 's <unk> right now and i 'm drooling for some pork on a fork as i write this . walk into the restaurant and you are <unk> with the smell of bbq , and like pavlov 's dogs ... immediately start drooling . i just could n't help but
2 a no frills hole in the wall hamburger joint . the burger is cooked to order , delicious , and the perfect mix of juicy and slightly greasy so you know you 're eating the real deal . the fixin ' bar is an interesting concept which i like since
2 31/2 stars . delicious . was it the <unk> watering experience , eh . but was it worth trying , for sure . we celebrated my husband 's birthday here , we were seated on the outside patio . it was gorgeous , 60s in <unk> . . got ta
2 this place is `` aight '' . it 's not a fancy seafood place , but its not long john silver 's either . i actually found it to be a bit pricey for the type of fare , even though understandably seafood tends to be more expensive . i
3 if you want pretty good sushi for a killer deal , this is the place . is the fish so fresh that i can still taste the ocean ? no . but , is it fresh enough for me to crave it and drive 40 minutes -lrb- one way -rrb-
3 this is our 2nd time at yasu and we really enjoyed the experience . it is small , dim , and intimate inside . decorated very tastefully with unique little touches . perfect date atmosphere . service was very good . our server was sweet and helpful . we shared
3 ah , dos . the old standby . for the last 9 years , it has always been our backup plan when we wanted to escape the newest pretentious old town scottsdale club . `` i 'm bored . and my drink was $ 10 . '' `` what do
3 after much anticipation my husband and i finally tried mi comida last night . i am so glad we did ! we got there about 8:30 and the place was packed with a small group of people waiting for a table outside . -lrb- no other place to wait .
2 i had a groupon for charr so my husband and i decided to go there for date night . i loved aiello 's when it was open and i like the <unk> they have next door . charr was decent but not overwhelmingly good . the atmosphere is nice ...
3 one of the best places for breakfast . we used to live within walking distance and we would have breakfast here frequently . scott 's rivals chompies with large hearty breakfasts with quicker and better service . we usually stick to omelets . they are giant , overstuffed , kinda
3 i usually hate chains , especially italian ones like olive garden and <unk> . but i was pleasantly surprised my maggianos . we went because we got a gift card for christmas but we are probably going back . the bread and the dipping oil they start you out with
3 wow ! my new favorite happy hour spot ! i was planning on seeing a <unk> at desert ridge with some girlfriends on a sunday and we were looking for a place nearby that offered happy hour on a sunday . humble pie has happy hour every day of the
4 ah , <unk> . a nice refreshing break from the s -- t storm called old town scottsdale . back in the day i used to get dragged along from one horrid nightclub to another . but on the rare occasion that my friends were feeling like <unk> it ,
3 i have been to su vino twice now and had a great time both times . both times we had a tasting and a cheese plate . all the wines are delish . i do agree with other yelpers that they could be a little more generous with the pours
4 just spent a beautiful weekend at the biltmore and stayed in the newly renovated <unk> wing . very nicely appointed rooms with frank lloyd wright inspired design . simple and very elegant . we loved the private concierge service with a great breakfast , cocktails and appetizers for the guests
3 great little patio with good food . be ready for a line and for informal dining . but in a good way . best to go when weather is nice .
4 must have : carne asada burrito . go for the big one if you can handle it . and the <unk> on friday and saturday ... mmmmmm .
3 the miniature golf portion is more fun than the water portion . hotter , but better . the water slides are very crowded and no better than the ones at our public pool -- and they only cost 50 cents ! but i agree with the other reviewer , the
4 <unk> resort ! the hype is true . very pricey , but if one can afford it , you definitely get what you pay for !
4 los dos is many an arizona native 's favorite mexican food place . and it has the -lrb- <unk> -rrb- reputation for the spiciest food around ! they also have a hoppin ' cantina . there is a lot of <unk> and triumph behind the los dos molinos franchise .
3 cooked in a real stone oven . tastes better than the <unk> `` new york '' style pizza in the area . they also have pastas , salads , soups , wings . oh -- and how could i forget -- garlic knots ! they 're yummy enough to break
3 i <unk> agree with shannon w. on this one ! very yummy , hearty homemade italian fare . and very reasonable prices ! that 's a big one for me , with a large family and a <unk> hubby : -rrb- anyway , giuseppe 's is perfect for family gatherings
2 after everything i 'd read , i was expecting to cozy up at the bar with the likes of david spade and <unk> jameson . instead , i ate alongside <unk> hipsters and tourists who 'd likely read the same reviews i did . bummer . the food alone sure
4 do you know what the nation 's largest municipal park is ? <unk> central park you say ? not even close . how about the largest city park in the world ? why , boys and girls , it 's right here in phoenix . south mt. park is a

2 the resturants food was good not amazing . the dj that night gets two thumbs up . the prices are a little high , but thats scottsdale . i like the design the most , but really nothing great otherwise
3 love the lunch pita ! and they always take my change in sauce request , no problem . i would say the drinking water is pretty bad so just ask for extra lemon or just go for a greek beer .
3 it was my first time having persian food , but it wo n't be my last . i loved the meal !
3 cibo never disappoints . my guest and i decided to sit outside . we had just missed the sprinkle of rain and felt safe under one of their umbrellas . there was a hint of coolness in the air . it was a great night . cibo 's front yard
3 i went to lunch at the breadfruit . it was around <unk> pm when my lunch date and i entered the tiny but warm restaurant . we had the place to ourselves . our waitress was great . right away she explained the menu and sold us on a couple
4 my partner and i have dined in france so we really like what zinc bistro is doing for french cuisine here in scottsdale arizona . the decor from floor to ceiling is spot on . i love the inner patio . when the weather is nice i like to see
3 i have been to the prime many times . my friends and family have celebrated birthdays and many other occasions at the prime . jenny -lrb- the owner -rrb- makes it special every time . jenny decorated our table , had a cake , and gave lucky chop sticks to
3 the tee pee 's been around since the 1950 's and there 's a reason why . their dishes are some of the best in the valley in my opinion . not all of them , but certainly their stuffed chile rellenos and green chile dishes . one of their

4 atkins and south beach diets say eat more red meat if you want to be thin . <unk> medical school says to eat more red meat if you want to be dead . <unk> , this means my new <unk> goal should be somewhere between thin and dead , and

1 i 'm not sure what the ` v ' stands for , but i think it means eddie v 's off course , a little more often than not . at least that 's sums up all my experiences . i 've been here three times , hoping at least

4 as a phoenix native , i 'm used to all the `` family '' owned mexican food restaurants like <unk> , macayos , and <unk> to name a few . so its great to see the <unk> family expand into scottsdale with their newest some burros location . i doubt

4 i ate here today . i was overwhelmed by the experience , it was just that good . service , food quality and prep , atmosphere ... all wonderful . after being seated , the waiter brought -lrb- gratis -rrb- a shot of <unk> and a small appetizer of prosciutto
3 the idea of lo-lo 's on a sunday morning has to rank right up there with <unk> , <unk> , and the <unk> . the line to get in was worse than the indiana jones ride at disneyland on a school holiday . the hostess was sweet , explaining how
1 do you believe in the <unk> ? well not anymore . because whatever it is you came <unk> , you 're not going to find it . why ? this is the denny 's of mexican food . look around . notice anything ? like how there 's no mexican

4 if you live in the vicinity of dc ranch , then you know there 's no such thing as a convenience store anywhere in the area . tom 's thumb is that convenience store , only it 's much , much more . its a car wash , convenience store
4 imagine what it would be like to eat an authentic french dip sandwich ... a thin bread roll cooked to crusty , dark brown perfection in a brick oven , its crumb moist and chewy . beef that 's neither chewy or fatty , nor with any hint of gristle
2 on the weird chance that someday i 'd get to meet the <unk> of the soft serve ice-cream machine , this is how our conversation would go ; `` so . . how did the idea of a soft serve machine come to you ? '' `` well , i
4 have you ever wondered why food <unk> only put a <unk> in <unk> yogurt ? could n't they have just as easily put it in a <unk> frozen pizza ? wtf ??? or why not beer . i like beer . even tortilla chips ... but yogurt ? well fuck
4 this one is a cut above the rest . for one of the most important meals of the day ... pick liberty ! the biscuits and gravy is delicious , you are not going to find a better combo in az ! all of us were in a `` sharing
4 wow ! what a great steakhouse with such a nice ambiance . the wait staff is superb , very professional and taught very well . they use technology and everyone is welcoming . they <unk> on each wine that they offer . we had such a fun experience with moscato
4 johnny chu ... i love you . sens is hands down my favorite place for asian in <unk> phx . the environment , the decor , the food and drink selection are all spot on . they have <unk> <unk> , a wonderful rice beer . it some of the
4 wow ! i 'll keep it simple . this small homey mexican restaurant has the best service i have ever experienced . the best mexican food ever ! everything is made from scratch , the flavors burst in your mouth and everything comes out piping hot ! order the baja
2 i checked out this place from a billboard i saw on the freeway . i 'm a sucker for chicken strips , so had to check them out . when you walk in , it 's a great industrial / modern feel . they have pop culture posters & signs
3 very tasty deep dish ! . the sauce is so sweet it puts my teeth on edge ... but i would love to use it when i eat some <unk> . really good pizza . ian sounds like he loses at life often . buck <unk> ' fella .
1 was a regular for a while . over time found the friendliness from the staff to be a bit of an act . zombie hipsters . long wait .
2 beer is okay . i had a sampler and the best beer was a guest brew . not a good way to start the meal . food was forgettable . i live in tempe . two blocks from four peaks . i do n't see myself coming back . but
3 i like the food here so far everything i have had has been good . i like the atmosphere has a very eclectic crowd that <unk> it . only downside the music is awful . if you say something about the music they will usually change it which is great
2 the burger and fries are both very good . i would have to say the food is way better than in n out . i still prefer smash burger over 5 guys though . my main complaint about 5 guys would be that they have to many tables smashed together
0 another popular place in phoenix but i got ta say why ? the food is the average run of the mill type you find all over phoenix and what a disappointment that is after waiting 2 + hours to get in . the atmosphere is nice but the services lacks
0 only one thing i can say for this place gross .
4 i 'm usually an amc man , and arizona center 24 is my guilty pleasure . however , went here with some friends last night to see <unk> . was n't disappointed at all . i forgot how nice it is to be around a new theater ... place was
2 sky harbor 's <unk> . i have no problems with it , but i 'm not infatuated with it either . driving through it is a pain , i 'll leave it at that . the numerous <unk> are confusing . terminals are far apart , but that 's not
3 my friend 's family owns this restaurant owns this restaurant ... so maybe i 'm a little biased ... but i always felt that the food and service here was great . lots of variety of authentic food , and `` americanized '' food on the menu . there 's
4 sweet tomatoes is the haven of all buffets . it 's large and clean with helpful staff and excellent food . -lrb- or so i 've found at this location -rrb- i may go there now ...
2 i 've always felt like the biltmore is overrated . it 's a money maker by it 's name , not quality . rooms are mediocre , and although the interesting architecture is a plus , it 's gray and i felt like i was in a castle or something
4 i came in here yesterday stressed to the point of an anxiety attack , and walked out with , literally , a pound of frozen yogurt . i 'm so ridiculous . but it was so good . the skinny blueberry is so incredibly delicious . frozen yogurt is making
1 desert ridge is n't a place for shopping , it 's a place for socializing and meandering . the store selection is crappy , to say the least . it 's dominated by middle school kids , which is to be expected . the only aspect of this mall i
2 i 've been meaning to try this place for the past several years , but have been put off by the wait time . last night -lrb- friday -rrb- , my friend -lrb- a former phx resident -rrb- was back in town for a quick visit and wanted for us
4 the most scrumptious pizza i have ever tasted out of a truck ; and it beats many traditional pizza restaurants as well . i tried the `` hottie '' this past friday at food truck friday . although the serrano peppers and jalapenos were not as spicy as i expected
3 love the decaf chai latte -lrb- hot or cold -rrb- w / boba . it 's a little expensive and they charge $ <unk> for soy milk , but it 's a treat that i look forward to whenever i 'm at tempe marketplace .
3 one of my favorite pizza places in the valley . i 've had several different combinations with ricotta and sausage being a few of my favorite toppings . grimaldi 's is always a hit amongst me & my co-workers for lunch . it can get pricey though when going in
3 i was debating between otfm and <unk> for my first -lrb- real -rrb- az farmers market experience -lrb- i checked out the one at el encanto dos off carefree <unk> a few weeks ago , but that one sucked big time so i think that hardly qualifies as a farmers
3 my wife and i wanted to have a nice sunday breakfast and head to over easy in north scottsdale . there was a 20 minute wait which we expected , but the waitress sat us down inside about ten minutes in . the waitress we had was very nice .
4 i went to matt 's big breakfast with my mother-in-law a few days ago and had a great experience . it seems like everyone on this thread is already raving about this place , so i guess i 'm just going to add more to it ! yes , it

1 this place was pretty dead on a friday night . maybe it 's because there are a lot of other options in this area . i know there 's a z tejas around the corner and another trendy restaurant near here too . that 's kind of a shame .
4 for me , any place that plays radiohead and <unk> service while serving dynamite coffee is a winner . lola is trendy without being pretentious and serves a damn good cappucino . . maybe the best i 've had . the couches are comfortable and the decor is simple and
4 i love that i can smell this place from across the street . roasting their own beans is impressive ; i can taste the quality . i 'm a cappuccino drinker and cartel is where it 's at in tempe . being an asu student , i feel spoiled be
2 great atmosphere and decor . when we went , there was live music and the place was practically empty . that made me nervous . however , the music was really good , and business picked up a little bit after we got there . we both were hungry ,
2 i have been here upwards of 5-6 times . we always go for the teppan and never for the sushi . as far as price goes -- it is definitely easier on the pocket than most chain teppanyaki restaurants . the dining room is small and personal , which i
2 after a couple visits to us egg , i am reluctant to say that this place is just a step above denny 's in the realm of breakfast . i ordered the half skillet half mini pancakes . the mini protein pancakes were n't <unk> , which was perfect .
1 burnt ends just okay , barbeque sauce pretty good , quesadilla bland , pulled pork sandwich was just okay . the meat was super fatty , even for barbeque . the fries have too much powder on them and taste like barbeque lays potato chips . service was just okay
3 went here because of restaurant week and just had to try the `` famous '' chop salad . i am wondering if that was the regular size or a smaller portion as part of the meal . the scallops were huge so getting 3 is no biggie , i am
1 employees seem a little snooty unless you are a regular . had a party of 7 and business was dying down so they just had to clean off tables and that took little over 10 minutes , but no biggie . the server took a while to come greet us
2 not bad . at least it 's not right on mill .
2 pretty darn tasty but you better like carne asada as it 's damn near the only thing on the menu . yes that 's an exaggeration but the menu is ridiculously limited and nothing but pork and beef . the horchata is excellent .
2 food was ok but the beer was very good . the service was rather poor and considering how empty the place was i would have expected a much more attentive waitress . i like the building and the open space is nice , too bad it 's way down in
3 what a fantastic upgrade over lisa g 's . the music is incredible , the people are cool and the beer selection is amazing . come here to be mellow and enjoy a tasty beer on the patio any time that you can , you wo n't be disappointed .
2 the food was good and would be rated higher if they could ever get my <unk> order right . i do not like finding a beef burrito when i order fish tacos . not even similar .
4 they have everything
3 really great pizza without the hype . do it .
2 standard dive bar . nothing extraordinary so if you 're not already close by , do n't bother .
3 super cool place with an amazing bottled beer selection . if they had that same selection on tap they 'd earn 11 stars .
2 this place could be super cool , if only they knew how to make coffee . the location is great , the layout is super fun and the music selection was fantastic . unfortunately the coffee was mediocre at best so i will not be returning .
3 the beer on tap is amazing . but i always feel like i 'm walking into a private room and it 's difficult to get a seat .
3 pretty nice . i was reluctant to go at first but it was totally not disappointment . menu has a ton of items and most of them somewhat unusual and interesting . we had tandoori chicken pizza and it was pretty ok , as far as pizzas from this kind
3 good joint . brought my friend who have not had good indian food there . he was willing to try again and i took him there . guess what - he liked it . whatever he ordered looked like baby 's poop - slimy and <unk> , but it tasted
3 pretty good if a bit odd . my take away pho was rather a bunch of different bowls and <unk> full of various stuff to build your own pho . cool in an odd way , perhaps ? also , i got wrong pho - seafood vs. chicken . kind
3 was pretty good . there was a lot of us and we <unk> a ton of stuff , family style . some was better , some was worse , but overall it was all pretty good . service was alright too . plates were clean as were tables and such
1 its a dump . mind you - a very nicely decorated dump . if you wish to hang out and yell over music with out much care what goes in your mouth then this place is for you . if you care about your food you should get in your
3 this place kicks major <unk> ! its new , its huge , its very well stocked , there are various free tastings all the times . we were the sunday and they had italian wine tasting . with real wine master present , never the less . i tasted and
2 i ate here last night with a friend . finding their chef 's combination options to be a little pricey , i decided to order two entrees individually , and my choices were their <unk> wat -lrb- spicy red lentils -rrb- and the <unk> <unk> -lrb- cabbage with carrot and
4 i love tasty kabob ! their food is always excellent , and i try to make it back there whenever i return to the valley . i always order their chicken shish kabob entree , which comes in a generous portion that includes rice and grilled vegetables . the chicken
2 i went here yesterday while i was out downtown and ordered a corned beef sandwich on an onion roll . contrary to the menu posted at the front of the deli , which mentioned potato salad or pasta salad as a choice of side dish , i was automatically given

2 i would like to try richardson 's again . i went on a date here and we were going to order a couple things off the menu , but the manager said , `` let me take care of you - you 're going to love this '' . we
4 so , you 're saying that i can get any bottle off of the list and my choice of bruschetta for only $ 20 . what 's that ? i can start my bottle now and easily move with my meal and my server once my table is ready ?
3 i found armitage to be very enjoyable for a late evening drink and a snack . it 's located in dc ranch , which has a very swanky feel -lrb- note : except for the random krispy kreme right there on market street -rrb- , and is a great place
3 5th and wine is becoming quite the old town hot spot . just 6 weeks since its doors opened , it seems to be quite popular for dinner and drinks alike . there was quite the crowd saturday night , which made it loud , but it had a very

2 we thought it was a steak house ... turns out it was like an old bar . we were surprised but stayed to check it out . i got the pulled pork sandwich that was nothing to write home about . alot of times you can base how fresh the
3 crackers has been in business for at least twenty years that i can remember . the reason you ask ? they use fresh ingredients and it shows . any dish you order will be excellent . large portions , wide variety of menu selections and great service ! perfect for
3 upon entering outback steakhouse , i was giving a little `` bingo '' game to be completed in order to win a really cool basket full of goodies - unfortunately , i did n't win , but that 's okay ! i was seated with a great group of people
3 this is my husband 's favorite ice cream shop . since it 's quite a drive from our house , we do n't get to go that often , but the times we do , sweet republic never disappoints . they have such a great variety of uncommon flavors .
2 the husband and i headed here for dinner since i had heard so much about it . i do n't like to read long stories about restaurants , i just want to know if i should go eat there or not , so here goes : hubs ordered the pork
2 it was our first time so i asked the blonde at the counter what was good . she said she did n't know since she does n't eat the food . um . ok . i ended up ordering the miso ramen , which a huge mistake . it was

3 ohh this place was delicious . i ordered the hawaiin ribeye and it melted in my mouth and the flavor just exploded ! i loved it ! the baked potato was piled high and i could probably eat that steak over and over again . their california roll was very
1 well , on the plus side , this is a super convenient place to gamble . on the down side , i do n't think i 've ever seen anyone win here . they do n't have single deck blackjack , they charge for cocktails while your gambling , and
2 wildflower was okay . it reminds me a lot of paradise bakery -lrb- if you put me inside one or the other it would be hard to tell the difference -rrb- . i 'm not a big fan of paradise , either , but i figured i 'd give wildflower
4 pita jungle is one of my favorites in town ! the food is amazingly crisp and fresh , and they have some inventive combinations as well as some authentic offerings . the place can be a bit pricy depending on what you get , but it 's a good value
3 i ca n't believe this place does not advertise what an good sushi bar they have ! we ate at the sushi bar because we heard about it from a friend . the place does n't have a sushi bar atmosphere more of fresh seafood market . the sushi chefs
4 cute place and they also have a great selection of beer and wine !
4 they were fast , friendly , and delicious ! which is my ideal place for a sand which shop . the reuben i got was so good ! i also liked that they offer fruit for only 50 cent more !
3 stopped in today for my first visit , and i have to say i was impressed with the food . also , they have a selection of about 30 different hot sauces that are rated on a 1 - 10 scale for hotness . i love hot sauce , so
4 wow ! this place just gets better and better ! today i discovered , by speaking with the owner <unk> , that a fatoosh salad means that the salad has fried pita chips in it . i had the fatoosh deluxe , which is a green salad tossed with a
3 their sausages are made by a place called <unk> fine sausages . if you do n't like the <unk> on your dog to snap when you bite into it , this is not the place for you . the food is good , and they have interesting menu options .
3 the first few years i was eating at this place , i just ate cheese pizza . when i try a pizza place for the first time , i just get a slice of cheese to see how it is before adding anything . i fell in love with the
3 overall , i like this place . the food is decent , the beer is decent , and it is n't really fair to compare this small place to the colossal four peaks . i have had almost every sandwich on the menu , and all are very good .
4 a true tempe gem . one of the few old businesses that the city of tempe has n't run out of town . full of character in a <unk> / <unk> way . quality bar . huge patio ! old bar indoors , very divey . indoor <unk> = two
2 they have just a few tv 's , which you cant see from some parts of the restaurant . the bar service is slow as molasses , and they have the <unk> to take a $ 60 hold on your credit card every time you sit anywhere near the door
0 ok we had a run in with this place today . my buddy loves it and swears it is the best pizza around . i 'd had it once and thought it was ok at best , definitely not the best in town like new times says . tried to
4 i read about this place in new times and saw two words that always speak to me like they are some <unk> foreign language ... cochinita pibil ! i 've made this dish at home a couple of times , and it takes me a couple of days , so
1 100 % completely underwhelming . i did n't want to rate it 2 -lrb- meh . i 've experienced better -rrb- but i even more so did n't want to rate it 3 -lrb- a-ok . -rrb- i do n't consider this place to be a-ok , more like completely
1 i used to frequent the lost leaf almost daily starting the day they opened , unfortunately i can not say the same anymore . i used to love the refrigerator full of beers , the music , and the cool little home , not to mention the biggest thing ,

2 they deliver downtown , hell yeah ! the food here has never been that great , but it has never been bad . they offer the traditional <unk> menu at affordable prices , but they make you pay a minimum to deliver it which is understandable . yay !
1 so my last review was quite favorable ... they took away the dart boards . they put tvs everywhere , like a sports bar . the service -lrb- minus the two regular girls -rrb- has gone to shit . food has gone downhill . i remember saying how the food
3 they have a beer <unk> outside on the wall , a weird <unk> theme down to the tropical nook inside , and a really weird collection of customers . this place makes me wonder why i 'd never come in sooner . it feels like a midwestern small town dive
1 wish these guys could get it right ! what a great place this so easily could be . it feels like a big city restaurant inside . the woman on the piano is a fucking genius , and i do n't think she can be <unk> . if you dine
4 this is my store . not yours , or your neighbors , or her mom 's , but mine . i love shopping at trader joe 's . they carry plenty of bagged meals for two people that you can just heat up and eat . they are n't full

2 old town scottsdale is a mecca for three things : tourists seeking cheesy and sometimes obnoxious knick-knacks , <unk> seeking overpriced novelty cocktails and easy ass , and middle aged well to do women spending money at boutiques while their husbands work to keep them wearing the current trends .
3 this restaurant is far and away the best steakhouse in arizona . i frequent morton 's , city hall , ruth 's chris , and capital grille , and donovan 's beats them all hands down . they actually include the vegetable and starch with the meat , rather than
3 edit : you ca n't beat a good restaurant within walking distance of your home . you also ca n't beat the fact that this location does n't have nearly the waits -lrb- if any -rrb- of it 's <unk> counterpart . the food is excellent , the service is
2 haji baba is good . not exceptional , but good . i do n't understand all the fuss about this place , kind of like fez where everyone raves about it and i just do n't get it , so maybe it is me . there is no atmosphere to
3 stopped by here for lunch today , just kind of on a whim . i 'd never been in the old <unk> 's garden diner , but it didnt seem like much could have changed . hell , the booths even have signs saying you ca n't sit there as
2 i do n't get the hype of this place . i just do n't get it at all . they have dry sandwiches served on bread that is not moist , but rather more like a store bought piece of french bread . it 's totally average at best .
2 it had been quite some time since i 'd been to the good egg , as my favorite midtown breakfast spot was always first watch . well , i went on probably a 2 year breakfast hiatus and had only been to a couple of places -lrb- i 'm a
3 pretty fancy place they have here , nestled in a strip mall near a boba shop , lee lee market , and a chinese restaurant . pho van has a large and well decorated dining room with a fish tank , plenty if gigantic televisions , and nice tile .
3 bouncers beating the crap out of <unk> drunks - check bouncers taking away my friends id that was not fake - check <unk> , arrogant , and brutal . i got no problem with it . i 'm a type a personality so i 'm all for knocking someone down

4 this review would be for the lounge only . i found out they offer taco tuesday here and i was in like so fast . for $ 2 i got a tostada thing with shredded tenderloin that was oh so tender with a deep fried egg and some jalapeno sauce
2 wow , i have to say we were both underwhelmed ... and i had hoped for so much more . i loved the building from the get go ... had been there before and thought it was brilliant to open a restaurant in that space . how cute ! cozy
4 this remains one of our favorite restaurants . we try and go late-night on fridays and head to the basement so we can see our favorite bartender steve . the food is even better now that we can get the richardsons menu ! i ca n't wait until the richardsons

3 if you 're hankering for some real texas bbq on the <unk> of town look no further . albeit this place is smack dab in the ghetto but when you walk inside the atmosphere is very <unk> . the guys behind the counter are extremely friendly they even offer samples

3 the best word to describe this place is cozy . this restaurant is n't for pretentious people . it was much smaller than i expected it to be , it had such a welcoming country kitchen nook feel . i tried one of their scrambles and boy was it tasty
3 we went on a very busy friday night . crazy busy , but a fun atmosphere , `` real '' people , and great energy . we have an excellent margarita while waiting . there 's a local band playing music - and they are very good . we are

4 this place is amazing . the service is fantastic ... the waitresses are gorgeous , friendly , and fast . we gave our phone number to the hostess , and within 15 minutes had a round of drinks and a table on the patio that was perfect for people watching
3 i love this place . the food is delicious , the drinks are strong , the service is outstanding , and the patio is nice . the only thing that could be improved is happy hour . every time i go , i look at the bill and am confused
4 i 'm adding a star to my original review for a couple of reasons . # 1 -rrb- i 'm totally falling for this place . the last few times i 've been in i 've <unk> a lot less attitude from the bar staff . crappy attitudes do n't
4 oh dear god , i 'm in love ... peppered filet and martini scallop dreams fill my mind . blue cheese stuffed olives in my martini ?? what ?? shut the fuck up !! sooooo amazing . quality all the way . i had a glass of <unk> pinot noir
2 do not even attempt to go here for lunch during the week between 11:30 <unk> . there are <unk> kids everywhere . you know what , just stay off camelback all together . you 've been warned .
1 the following pretty much sums up my experience at zoe 's : me : `` hi , i 'd like the turkey pita please '' zoe -lrb- or sum other dumb bitch -rrb- : `` so you 'd like the feta with feta ? , would you like something to
3 i hate the word `` stew '' . it 's right up there with slacks , moist and <unk> . that said , st francis ' pork chile verde -lrb- i refuse to call it stew ... * cringe * -rrb- was phenomenal . wow ... just wow . i
3 this is my go to theater since the remodel . i 've never been much of a movie goer , not a huge fan of the whole crammed like sardines into a room with a bunch of strangers thing ... amc esplanade is a game <unk> . i 'm a
3 holy insanely delicious sweet potato fries ! how have i never had these before . i feel like a <unk> for updating my review based on fries but i do n't really give a shit . they are that good . go go now . .
2 if you do n't feel like mojo and do n't want to pay the price mojo , go to yogurtland . all the girls around town flock to places that have frozen yogurt because of the price and girls love the frozen yogurt . they usually have a good selection
3 i heard about this place from many people and have been wanting to try it and i finally did . i did not get a chance to try the food but i heard its good from many people . i went on the night of my 21 birthday and thought
3 i went to this place for my 21st birthday because i heard about it being a cool bar on yelp . i find that this place lives up to the reviews . it is a hipster place , but they have created a clean and intimate space that is nice
2 i go for the <unk> and the fries thats about it . my friend is a vegan and she tell me to try the best stuff on the menu . so far i had one sandwich with fake chicken with bbq that was pretty good . however , everything else
2 i ended up in tempe when i could n't fathom <unk> the crowds at the zoo lights . i really had to go to the bathroom after parking in the area so i decided to stop in to gordon for a beer and a wee . the food smelled delicious
1 i was way too lazy and not up for going out to eat the monday after christmas so i decided to go online and order some mamma mia based on the reviews here on yelp . i ordered the pizza , wings and soda special . the pizza was pepperoni
3 i 've been going to this place for years . i actually went on my first date with my current partner here . it 's a bit nostalgic for me . the happy hour is great ! they make a ton of different rolls and they do them well and
3 i was looking to grab some tacos one night . i checked out yelp and found that this place was in walking distance from my home and the reviews were great ! oh yeah , taco time ! for some reason i did n't check out the menu or attire
3 i 've been to golden buddha a few times and have not been disappointed . they have a large selection of dim sum and if you 're not careful you can get carried away . try and get there early and you 'll get the best and most fresh selection
3 i stopped off at fresh wasabi for lunch today . i was n't expecting too much when i walked in since it was empty and almost 12:30 pm . i sat down , ordered a water and 3 rolls from their lunch menu special . 11.95 for a philly ,
3 great -lrb- but small -rrb- place . nice atmosphere and have come here for going away parties but rarely i 'll admit on my own doing -lrb- because i do n't live very close mostly -rrb- . wish they offered a better array of appetizers or finger foods but hard
3 finally made my way to the new lolo 's in scottsdale . live close by and really have n't heard of it until about a month ago when i was <unk> a video at blockbuster . decided to go fairly late saturday before they closed and at about 2pm the
3 i can honestly say that for those who have given one star -lrb- based on a not the venue but a performer -rrb- , this place is as good and nice as any other . i 've seen the fray , comedian gabriel <unk> , chelsea <unk> , ray <unk>
3 i have n't been to many yogurt places in town . use to love going to <unk> when i was a kid and it seems like the one in town near via linda just is n't the same . i 've tried the local favorite ice tango in hilton village
3 people that are rating this place low are nuts . it 's a greasy spoon sure , and yes , sometimes as you 'd expect from such the service leaves something to be desired . that being said this is a super tasty burger . very moist and delicious .
1 if you 're a dude , stay away from this place ... unless you 're in the mood for a cat fight , you can see some of those here for sure . i 've only ever been here with girlfriends , the guys section is only awesome if you
2 for me this place is truly just ok . i work nearby and my bosses bring this stuff in on occasion . the chicken and the macaroni salad are both pretty great but i just never find myself having a hankering for this stuff . i 've still yet to
3 `` you do n't need no teeth to eat our meat '' haha , what else needs to be said . this place is a solid bbq joint . i 'm from the southeast and i love pork bbq . i was raised on nc style -lrb- from southern va
2 when i first moved to arizona i used to obsessed with this place . the hummus was amazing and they had some delicious entrees . now that 5 years have passed , the novelty of pita jungle has worn off . now it seems like everything is oversized portions with
1 six months ago i would 've written a glowing review about how cheuvront is filled with everything amazing . from their wonderful servers to the beer , the cheeses , the wines , and the food . then i came in to have a drink with my brown boy after
4 as much as i love the original postino , this one is equally amazing , if not a little better . the bartenders here are really sweet , and make sure that you are good to drive home before you leave . for the record ... i <unk> my speech
3 so i came here last night for a first date and was pleasantly surprised . we hit up the bar so i could check out all the local art under the glass . it was a cute touch , i love when restaurants play up the neighborhood 's culture .
4 love the beer selection they have there ! it 's an interesting place to take people who are n't into that kind of scene . they start feeling uncomfortable the second the <unk> begins . i never get to stay there long enough because of my friends , but they
3 this is the place to go if you want to dress like a hipster for cheap and with higher quality than forever 21 .
4 so i 've been to lgo numerous times over the past couple years , ever since my girlfriend took me there for a hungover breakfast . i 've always enjoyed their variety of menu options , and find it a good place to take people for a quick and easy
3 adorable italian family making amazing italian food . the owner and his wife and sons are total <unk> and produce some <unk> great italian food in a strip mall in north scottsdale .
4 man , when my <unk> used to work there he would always bring home the best food . i love their <unk> masala and lamb saag ! they also have some of the best naan around ! if you do get dessert , the <unk> <unk> is insanely sweet ,
4 so i really wanted to visit my friend in california , but i was tired of walking and driving . my friend told me about something called <unk> , and told me to find that at an `` airport . '' the nice people at the ticket counter even checked
3 from the perspective of a farmer 's market frequenter , old town scottsdale finds a way to keep it fresh . in terms of the produce , you can definitely taste the difference in quality when you bring the food home . for this basic quality of farmer 's markets
2 perhaps i 'm being harsh on literally the only ramen joint for maybe <unk> of miles , but this place is alright . the ramen is decent given the price . given the taste , it 's good but it 's not great . the tonkotsu broth has the <unk>
3 probably the best cheesesteaks i 've had in the area were from this joint . i love the environment , got that bar and the pool table . really nice that it 's open 24/7 . love the classic steaks with whiz . fries are really good too , crisp
2 bj 's is ok on occasion . my husband loves the mostly <unk> , <unk> pan pizza . me , not so much . however , the atmosphere seems fun -lrb- kind of loud , but that <unk> out our usual loud talking -rrb- . there are <unk> tvs throughout
2 why i shop here : 1 -rrb- petsmart , closer to where i live -lrb- <unk> cat food ~ check -rrb- 2 -rrb- best buy , closer than fiesta -lrb- rarely <unk> dvds ~ check -rrb- 3 -rrb- cost plus world market , closer than fiesta & not yet out
3 this is my favorite salsa in town , right now . the old <unk> holds true : the less impressive the architecture , the more impressive the food . you 're not going to impress your boss with this phoenix gem , but for an afternoon of $ 3 margaritas
3 i think i 've been putting of writing a hula review . do n't go here !! it 's wonderful , and i like that there 's almost always somewhere to sit without waiting !! expect to see someone you know , or someone you want to know at hula
2 oh , true food . i want to love you . but you make me feel like i 'm eating in a cafeteria . with such a contemporary menu and a staff full of bright shiny faces this restaurant is just a contradiction in form ... the menu and ambience
2 food 2 stars <unk> 3.5 stars cute place . food , not so ` cute ' i was a little disappointed with the food here . i read the reviews , and was very excited about trying this place . we ordered a ton of food and i was unimpressed
3 was at the launch of the ipad 2 on friday . was very impressed with the service , organization , and thought that went into those waiting in the very long line . i have never in my life waited in line for a toy , and there i was
3 if you want bruschetta , you can not go wrong here ! you get to pick four . request to have them cut in <unk> , much easier to eat ! faves prosciutto with figs & mascarpone brie & apples with fig spread fresh mozzarella with tomato & basil ricotta
3 love this place ! located in an unassuming strip mall , the restaurant is simple and modern with a long and narrow dining area . you ate sitting pretty close to your fellow diners , but i did n't mind at all because the service was not lacking at all
2 for the price , you ca n't beat it , since the only other conveyor belt sushi places are in tempe or la . . it 's mediocre at best for sushi standards , but hey , it 's <unk> . a couple sake bombers and you 'll be good
3 i have n't been here in years until a few weeks ago for a girls happy hour . i guess i always forget about this place because of the location ? i always pass by it on the way to fashion square tho ! : -rrb- i will have to
4 hmmm . <unk> nut chicken i will push on people till i am <unk> . it 's fantastic and if you like mashed potatoes with <unk> . . you 'll be extra happy . . its the perfect dish ! beware though it 's heavy so i do n't suggest
3 saw -lcb- title of show -rsb- last night . . freakin hilarious . its like will and grace meets the seinfeld concept . . set to music ? hard to explain but it was great and i have raved about to my friends now im raving to you . its
3 i didnt know what to expect since this place replaced pink taco . pink taco looked like a cross between the set of nacho <unk> and an <unk> lodge . well cd kept the <unk> lodge part and married it with z <unk> and i like it . the waitstaff
4 omg . . i love what you 've done with this place . saw twilight - breaking dawn here -lrb- dont judge me -rrb- . service was excellent , food was excellent . seats were comfy . . love that there is reserved seating ... i dont know why you
2 last year i had the most amazing eggs benedict i have ever encountered . chelsea 's kitchen used mouthwatering shredded pork and a lemon poppy hollandaise instead of canadian bacon an a standard hollandaise . it was to die for -lrb- see pic -rrb- . recently however , i have
2 first timer . . found via the urban spoon app . service was excellent , im going to say that right off the bat . the rush had come and gone and by the time we sat down it was 5 til 7pm . we didnt even know about the
0 sooo disappointed . arrived here yesterday with a friend at about <unk> pm . seated promptly . an over bubbly petite girl approached our table . . -lrb- you know the kind . . tgi fridays `` flare '' type -rrb- speaking in <unk> tones , we 'll call her
2 my former boss hangs out here consistently . . he 's a creepy dirty old man in his early 60 's in an `` open marriage '' who <unk> for women here . . ick but the urban spoon app picked it so i thought id give it a shot
1 man , we were really looking forward to this . after watching the sichuan episode of bizarre foods the other day i realized that , while i have had sichuan dishes before , i had never had hot pot . we usually go to the chinese cultural center for golden
2 i 'm really conflicted about this place . there are not too many taiwanese restaurants in the valley and i wish them success . i will probably go back . but our experience was mixed . we ordered quite a few different things to get a sampling and two dishes
4 after reading the yelp reviews , we had been looking forward to trying this place . we were not disappointed . we had dinner there on a weeknight . eventually we 'll get around to trying the sunday brunch everyone raves about . i had the ribeye and my wife
3 i read about this place in phoenix magazine . i drive by this all the time , but never noticed it , hidden as it is in a non-descript strip mall . three of us went and we ordered a ton of stuff . none of us had ever tried
2 3.5 stars would be more accurate . as others have mentioned , this place is attached to a small store -lrb- goat on sale right now for $ 3.99 ... not bad -rrb- and that makes the vibe a little odd . no big deal though . i liked the
3 of course homemade sausage , cheese , and pizza dough is amazing . the wait is of course <unk> long . be prepared for that . it 's gourmet pizza with high standards .
4 for a local hamburger place this is it for me . they have it all . great fries , wonderful burger , and good buns -lrb- and yes that 's vital ! -rrb- . any soda you can think of ! great place !
3 these are not like my chicago dogs i grew up with but are tasty none the less . when you are in line make sure you know what you want and pay attention cause they keep the line moving . fries are good and of course so are the dogs
3 i 've never been one to hit up the mill bar scene . at nearly <unk> ... at my age , i just assumed it was all going to be the obnoxious college crowds everywhere . rula bula was definitely not what i expected at all ! thankfully ! it
0 i had made reservations for my boyfriend 's birthday . they tried to transfer me to a special events coordinator whom i did not want to speak to and did n't seem to understand that i did n't want some package deal , i wanted two lanes and everyone was
4 i 've been back here several times since my first review . the quiche was great ! and the breakfast burrito bomb . omg ! the staff at luci 's is always great , friendly polite . they 're starting to know me by name !
4 delux is one of these places that i can go to and guarantee that whatever i order on the menu will be fantastic ! they do n't have a large menu , but everything , including the service , is great . most recently i ordered the hot dog .
4 just as expected , 5 stars this time . i came here with three other friends on new years day and we were seated promptly . the entire staff , from the manager , to host , to bartenders were extremely friendly and welcoming . our server was exceptionally great
1 after eating at jimmy john 's in chicago and <unk> , i was so excited they opened one here . not just here in town , but like 15 feet from work !! it just opened this past week and i rushed over as soon as i could . i
4 i never once thought that one of the best burgers i 've ever had would come from a vegan resturant , but it does . i 'm not vegan , or even vegetarian , but i 've been to green numerous times and while i 've enjoyed many things on
4 ok so i figured the true test of how good this place actually is , would be to come back with a friend who was born and raised in hawaii . she loved it ! the drinks are dangerous ! so good , i had to force myself not to
4 when trying something new , i have learned not have any expectations , positive or negative , until i have experienced it for myself . otherwise , i 've either felt let down because i expected too much or i did n't let myself have a good time because i
4 i bring my dog here twice a month and i love it . no appointment needed -lrb- unless you get them groomed which i do not -rrb- and for less than $ 20 i get her nails <unk> and i wash her myself . they provide the supplies and i
3 what can you say about a movie theater ?? i prefer harkins . their popcorn is better that the rest and they have toppings to put on their popcorn . the theater is always clean and everyone greets you with hi , hope you enjoyed the show .
3 trip downtown for flowers . wife had seen or someone had told her about matt 's . wow ! did find a place to park but had about a 20 min wait . we were there fairly early on a saturday morning and really did not expect this many people
2 this place has only been open for about 5 days and they are still trying to get everything worked out . my son suggested this place , it is close and i like to patronize places in my community . when we got there there was several people waiting to
2 i was really excited when i read the reviews from the other yelpers about this restaurants . when i arrived i was really impressed with how nice it looked . the bar is n't large or the restaurant in general is n't that big , but it seems pretty lively
3 i really love this part of scottsdale . you have a vast choice of amazing restaurants . we decided to try citizen public house . the atmosphere is an energetic one . i ca n't really remember the last time i went to a restaurant at 5:30 in evening and
3 i celebrated a friends birthday today at postino . it is a really busy place ! we decided that we would order a little of this and a little of that . so we started with the nyc grilled cheese sandwich . i like it , it came with three
3 my husband and i went for dinner last night and really enjoyed our evening . we started with the ahi steak tartare . i would come back for that dish alone ! i normally order the tartare where ever i go , but this has been my favorite ! as
3 i met a few friends for lunch here during the week and it was pretty busy . they had a decent lunch drink special which is always a plus ! we shared the mongolian beef flat bread . it was delicious . i was tempted to order another one to
2 my husband and i went here for valentine 's day . they called to confirm our reservation , which would have been fine if the guy on the phone was <unk> . the service was really great . i enjoyed the pork belly and my husbands duck was good .
3 my family and i came to upper crust after receiving a free pizza card from yelp 's <unk> . it was a pretty long drive for us , but well worth it . we had good service . we asked the server what she suggested and she said that the
3 sandwiches are my thing . i want to eat as many of them as possible from as many different places as i can . and let me tell you , there is just something about the sandwiches from cheese 'n stuff . it 's not big on atmosphere . there
4 i just need to update this with some new things i 've found to like about pizza heaven . first of all : the vegan cheese they have here is delicious . i did n't know they had it and was stuck getting lousy z pizza when i was eating
3 i really do n't understand all the bad reviews for this place . i love coming here . the food is always tasty and satisfying . i usually get the french toast if i 'm in the mood for breakfast or the coleslaw veggie burger if i 'm feeling like

3 step off the bus and into fresh food ... we 've sat through <unk> 's <unk> routine twice in the past few weeks . i 've worked in fast food , restaurants , ship 's <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and seen a few grease traps , grease screens ,
3 where <unk> danced ... it 's 10:30 p.m. on friday , october 1 . we got an ice cream cone at pink spot , open 'til 10 p.m. those are important words in central phoenix on friday night . not only did we get ice cream , but i walked
3 venue with five cozy theaters . as mentioned , a place to view indie films in the phoenix metro area . movies like `` <unk> dreams of sushi '' and other <unk> gems . one of the few <unk> public locations for `` phoenix mushroom shade '' architecture , structures
4 if you 're new to mexican food or you want to have a stylish and intimate phoenix mexican dining experience , <unk> es el <unk> . intimate bar too . when service staff smile have <unk> <unk> and dreamy looks about the food as they describe it , one knows
4 <unk> <unk> , i commend your hard work and devotion to your industry . in my tiny corner of the world , this is as good as it gets . i ate chinese , or something like chinese food three times , three separate places in one august 2013 week
3 this is it , the last weekend ever to get some mary <unk> 's home made ice cream .
4 great spot . zipps is pretty good all over . i 'm glad they came to the neighborhood . hazelwood 's has probably the worst service i 've encountered in a sports bar . zipps always has great service and good drink specials . good place to be even when
3 great place to grab a slider . have a banana milkshake . they 're delicious . the italian beef is a great sandwich too . hot giardiniera is the best on top . service is always great here , but i recommend ordering ahead and carrying out at lunch time
2 i 'm giving hazelwood 's a tentative 3 stars . it seems as if they 've fixed their service issues . i 've been there a few times for happy hour in the past month and they seem to have <unk> a team service method . still good food and
2 i came here a while back based on the reviews from yelp . the place is a dark bar with little seating on the side . the vibe is a cool hang out . it was very dark so i ca n't be sure but the place did n't seem
3 i 'm amazed to find a place like this in az !! i was ranting and raving about it for days because it really surprised me how good it could be . when i went there , i got so excited i ordered <unk> of my favorites . got the
3 i encountered this place when i went to the phoenix rock gym and was excited to try it ! i moved here from california not too long ago and was missing the delicious ramen places back home . i got the republic ramen and a black milk tea with boba
4 this place is great . i 've been here twice now , and i 've tried three different burritos . the burrito with machaca and eggs is by far my favorite . the service is a little bit slow , but everything is made fresh . it 's a family-owned
0 i went here with a group of people , and i 'm really glad that i was n't the one footing the bill , because if i was , i would have been angry and disappointed . we came into the restaurant for lunch shortly after it opened , and
3 sola is the first coffee shop that i 've found in old town scottsdale that is n't a copy of a starbucks . their coffee is wonderful , the staff is pleasant , and their pastries are delicious . as a real estate agent specializing in assisting buyer 's in
3 i 've lived next to this coffee store for years and this is the first time i 've been in . it seems very popular as it was pretty busy . they managed the line quickly and took my order without any issues . i love that they have almond
2 habit burger is a pretty good place if you 're in the mood for a burger and want something better than mcdonald 's but do n't want to spend $ 10 at one of those gourmet places . they fall right in the middle , think in n ' out
3 i am always in the mood for a good deli sandwich and i was randomly driving by <unk> 's while looking for a place to have a late lunch . in an environment surrounded by large chain restaurants with your standard unhealthy boring food breadcrafters was a real discovery .
4 i went to this theater on opening night and was very impressed by the entire experience . when you order your tickets you 're not just ordering them from some kid behind a glass who hates their job . you feel as if you 're ordering tickets for an actual
4 four words : creme brulee peach pancakes . get it . you can get a single pancake for only 3.25 and it 's absolutely worth it ! the banana caramel french toast was also amazing .
4 came back here a couple weeks ago when my niece was in town . this time , the bartender was our server . i ca n't remember what my niece had but she gobbled it up so it must not have been bad ... i had the roasted pork that
3 i 've been to yasu several times now . when i say i `` love sushi '' , what i mean is i love the rolls that are deep fried and covered in mayonnaise . the roll menu is quite limited , but all are good including the salmon skin
3 came here last night with a girlfriend for diner to use a groupon . small place , very cozy . i want to say , maybe 7 tables <unk> my friend did say there appeared to be a room for larger parties also . ordered the bruschetta with beans on
0 i stopped here after lunch for some baklava ... . . well ... ... that was by far the worst baklava i 've ever eaten . i was so disappointed , after reading the reviews i was expecting something that would knock my socks off . i ordered 1 piece

1 well i hate to be the <unk> of bad news , but i had an awful experience here and it makes me hesitant to ever go back despite the good reviews for dinner and dessert . i went for lunch with my husband . i wanted to see the menu
3 eat lunch and chill out , perfect ! i 'd never heard of rumbi until i got some coupons in the mail -lrb- yeah , i said coupons , i 'm not ashamed to use them -rrb- so i figured we would give it a shot since we were burnt
3 i just happen to drive by , i would have never know about it otherwise . it 's kind of in a funny spot -lrb- <unk> area -rrb- i had planned on getting a sandwich until i walked in and saw the special `` green chile and corn quiche with
3 i 've been twice . first time i had very slow service , but the chips and salsa were so delicious i did n't care . they serve two kinds of salsa with their chips both are fresh and fire roasted , one is your basic -lrb- red -rrb- salsa
4 what can i say ~ i love ruth 's chris ! from the moment i walked in i was waited on with the <unk> attention . i made a reservation for some friends and i. i arrived early so i sat at the bar and ordered some calamari -lrb- see
1 i have been here a couple of times and just not written a review for this location . last time was great everything we ordered was delicious and fresh , this time not so much , at least as my food was concerned . on a recent rip to california
1 i have to start by saying i give an `` a '' for effort in being an independent business . but and there ' s a big but and no it 's not mine , the ice cream is not good . i stopped in today after looking all over
1 so i have been lured back several times ... . it 's such a <unk> they suck you in with the fancy menu and these fab chips and salsa , trust me after eating those you 'd expect to the food to be pretty damn good , but no ,
2 i met andrea k. here for lunch . i have n't been to oregano 's in nearly 2 years and i 've never been to this location . i thought i 'd arrive a few minutes early so we would n't have to wait since andrea was on her lunch
4 i loved everything about this place from the moment i walked through the <unk> entrance . they actually grow an assortment of their own vegetables right on their own patio , how cool is that ! not to mention it 's a very inviting space . inside was no different
2 ok so i end up here for lunch only because the place i wanted to go did n't open till 4pm . it 's really beautiful inside , there is alot of elements working , chain , leather , iron , <unk> , wood , very upscale modern but comfortable
4 i was enchanted just upon entering this place -lrb- see pics -rrb- it only got better once i was inside even though it was a pretty small place , approx . 10 tables . it was dark for ambiance but brightly decorated , white linen tables , fresh flowers on
4 after hearing i could get a vegan hot dog , i finally made it down to food truck friday . let me tell you the anticipation was killing me . i saw the long line and knew it must be amazing , none of the other trucks had a line
0 i can think of no reason to go back here other than proximity to downtown .
4 love these guys . period .
4 i do n't give 5 stars . but <unk> place gets it because of the consistency in food , service and atmosphere . its very rare place , with <unk> - # $ % parking . but there 's not much they do about that , especially during asu football
4 whoa . those were some damn good waffles . i recommend <unk> half of the butter off your grits , cause once it melts there 's not room in the bowl for the both of them !
4 this place is awesome . i guess i should mention that i 'm not a serious <unk> , i just do it every so often for fun , so i 'm not sure how this place compares on a more hardcore level . it can get a little pricey depending
2 nice to hang out here -lrb- when it 's not packed -rrb- and play <unk> , but i had to stop going because their cd player was skipping like mad and they would not turn it off . it drove me and my friends nuts . every time we returned
1 i do n't know if i 'm really digging on these hip sushi joints . . i prefer the more ` traditional ' places where everyone working the place screams `` <unk> '' in <unk> when you walk in the door . - the fried tofu was delicious , i
4 i ca n't believe i found this place a month before i move to the other side of the world . lame . i 'll have to visit again before i get on the plane . the <unk> sandwich ... it is the pork to end all pork , my

1 `` honey i shrunk the lunch specials and the restaurant , too ! '' is more <unk> of a name for thai basil . now do n't get me wrong , i like thai basil . the food is decent and the interior is nice , but the <unk> seem
2 i like z-tejas , but i just ca n't get past the just average seafood enchiladas . it 's short on taste , short on seafood , and big on spinach and other filler . see barrio and tradiciones for kick ass seafood enchiladas . the decor is very upscale
4 yes , folks . this place pretty much rocks . the best way to describe it is that it 's like a really hip study lounge -lrb- from the clue board game -rrb- without the books or the geeks , but with a bar , pool table and jukebox instead
3 ok , i 'm gon na take one for the team and admit it . is it bad that i love love love this place ? no judging now . i mean , i usually reject any restaurant remotely <unk> , but cheesecake factory , you are one of a
3 furio is just right in so many ways . white leather lounge sofas and the bold sexy decor set the mood and suggest an air of pretension , but the friendly service and basketball game on tv balance that with an air of a laidback <unk> . the lounge area
3 fish market gets a solid four stars from me . i had n't been to fish market in four years until i went twice in the last 2 weeks . it 's my friend 's favorite , but he 's a big fan of their sushi happy hour , of
3 iconic frank lloyd wright architecture and high-quality event <unk> combine to make asu 's gammage auditorium a cultural gem and a highlight for the arts in arizona . besides being a stop for the 2004 u.s. presidential <unk> , it 's probably most well known for its role as the
3 the reviews are all <unk> . the jade red chicken and carnitas with chinese fried rice and with black beans were really good . and the savory snickerdoodle with every order is a sweet touch ! for first timers they walk you through the ordering process which can be a
3 i think the piano and the older crowd give this gay bar a bad rap . my friend jeff and i like it a lot nevertheless -- probably because it makes us feel 21 . it 's become a sunday day drinking outpost for us . it 's a great
4 i had the good fortune of being able to relax a few mornings away here recently . definitely a little piece of new york in arcadia - it has the feel of the many gourmet <unk> stores there . i do n't go here as much as i should ,
3 yes , it 's <unk> . but i must admit , this is still one of my favorite bars . i love that i can use the merc as a <unk> chip to get my scottsdale peeps to come into central phoenix . this place is not nearly as pretentious
3 camelback ranch , the spring training home of the l.a. dodgers and chicago white sox , is huge and <unk> gorgeous . it has a much different feel than a typical spring training stadium and the approach with meandering lakes , <unk> designs , elevated <unk> and lush landscaping like
3 now , i can think of several places in town that serve amazing pizza - la grande , and pizzeria bianco come immediately to mind . but pizza heaven gets 4 stars for other reasons . it 's cheap , tasty no-frills kind of pizza , with something for everyone
4 simply amazing and completely fitting for a <unk> review . i do n't know that a more lengthy first sentence can do it any better . i 'll spare you from the i went to spain <unk> , but i do know good spanish dining on several different levels and

3 the pulled pork here is fantastic ... and the bbq sauce , i do n't know what they do it , but it 's finger lickin good ! they add just enough spice , sweet and kick to make it <unk> . you ca n't go wrong with a bbq
3 great beers on tap - four peaks and oak creek among them . 8th st. ale - i heart you . the place was playing <unk> radiohead and <unk> <unk> and <unk> kid . that in itself is pure genius . liked the beer barrels showcased through a window .
4 i have to give props to chef beau <unk> for doing `` fusion '' right . `` fusion '' is a dime a dozen nowadays , and only a few can do it well . for dinner , i highly suggest the salmon with the udon noodles , if it
2 food-wise , i 'd give the place another star , but the waitress ruined it for me . la stalla is located across from the historic san marcos hotel . it is a very intimate place , bordering <unk> , italian restaurant . i dined here for a business talk
1 if you know me , you know that i 'm an advocate of almost anything phoenix . that 's why when lucky strike was set to move into cityscape , i was thrilled . i 've been to the lucky strike in la , and have always had a great
3 spendy , but nice atmosphere and great selection of food on a buffet . you ca n't get a buffet this good anywhere else ! dining on the outdoor patio is intimate and romantic . space is limited . the casino is n't bad too . stop by on your
3 trader joe 's is a hip , <unk> little grocery store . no where near as gargantuan as the typical stores have grown to . not joe 's ! i like joe 's for several reasons : 1 . prices ! their prices are good . not always the best
4 staff is great and helpful . food is fast and fresh and the price is very reasonable . this is our new sunday afternoon haunt .
2 great service and food . cheap too . motif is early reggae stoner basement .
3 this is not very far from my home , but for some strange reason , i have never visited there . maybe because we do n't have new york deli 's in spokane , and i 'm not familiar with the idea . the other day , i agreed to
3 finally !! after three separate tries , i made it to the vermont sandwich company when they were open . i had to meet the carpet cleaner at 1:00 pm and was starving . so i stopped , and they were actually open . it is n't that they do
2 i went to the blanco tacos in tucson when it first opened , and really enjoyed it . it was more of a casual eatery in a in the back of an upscale shopping center in north tucson , so i was happy when i heard that one was opened
3 i 'm always up for a bratwurst and a beer , and since i was in the area , thought i would give this place a try . i 'm glad i did . i had coincidentally entered the bar , rather than the dining area ; the bar ,
2 this is a little tavern located in scottsdale quarter . i have stopped in after a visit to the apple store several times . the menu was very limited , the actual bar area was very small , and the decor was nice but not overly comfortable feeling . it
1 i was late to try over easy , but clearly there was no harm in waiting . the service is slow and the food mediocre . notwithstanding the hype , nothing special going on here . i do n't plan on returning .
3 ok , most of my prior review still holds . the duce is still a strange space . and it is still great with a group . i returned on a friday night with a group of about ten people . no problem getting a table -lrb- a nice big
4 the roaring fork is one of my very favorite restaurants . i am not a big fan of the environment , particularly the patio and back rooms , but the food more than makes up for it . the pork green chili served with warm tortillas is dreamy . i

2 i really wanted to like this place , i did . what with the tapas and the good reviews it has , i figured that i was in for a real treat . and while the ambiance of the restaurant definitely delivered - a cool , dark interior with comfy
2 i wish yelp would let us give half stars ... cause this place would definitely be getting 2.5 stars from me . however , since i do n't have that luxury , and since i 'm feeling generous , we 'll go with 3 . suffice it to say ,
3 clean and friendly staff . great prices before 11am and <unk> before 6pm its $ 5
4 a taste of home ! i am definitely california grown and needed my shaved snow . it 's not the same as shaved ice . . not big pieces but little snow pieces that melt in your mouth . they had the best green tea snow i have ever had
1 i guess its not bad for an airport resturant . the service was so bad . . it took us 10 mins each time to flag down the waitress . we got shrimp tacos that were pretty good except it only had 1 shrimp in each of them ... i
2 pulling up to the resturant gave me high expectations , it was beautiful . it did n't seem to have much parking so we had to valet , at least it was free . we were sat promptly as my friend was already waiting there . they do not sit
3 went to the outlets because i was told coach has a store their !! no more having to goto cali for that ! i was excited to see that there was a coach store but very heartbroken to see that it was not yet opened : -lrb- oh well .

3 i love harkins camelview theater ; it 's the <unk> film theater house to go to ! yes it 's a harkins theater , but it gives off a little bit more of an artsy <unk> . in the metro valley it 's just nice to know that there is

3 i really like bar food , almost too much , and it 's something i probably need help with . i can mostly thank some great spots in my home town , but locally , zipps can be <unk> for my <unk> . their burgers are consistently hot and flavorful
3 people go out to eat for one of two reasons : to enjoy a night out and get of the house , or to get food they ca n't make at home . well i can promise most of you that you can make almost the entire don & charlie

4 very good lunch specials ! i went here for dinner and had a great meal . i will definitely come back to try some more new , delicious meals .

3 i could go there just to eat chips and salsa , very good ! the tacos are really good too . small little place with great service and great food .
4 this place is my church ... i love coming here religiously on the weekends for lunch . you ca n't beat the selection , quality and flavor of everything on the menu . it 's tough to decide between chino and tacos atoyac ... so i usually end up having
3 yum yum yum . this restaurant is too close to my house to be a good thing . love their samosas , chicken tikka masala , garlic naan bread , lamb vindaloo , and everything else i 've tried here . staff is really sweet . lunch buffet actually has

3 the location of this place , city north , has been struggling a bit over the years with restaurants that can keep their doors open . it 's a fun location ; several restaurants and stores all within walking distance to each other . i liked this restaurant a lot
3 went again to this place last night for a little happy hour with my networking group . we reserved the <unk> back room for our group that would easily hold about 25-30 . they had a few food items on happy hour $ 4 special ; potato skins , bruchetta

0 shockingly bad food and service . we were with a private <unk> upstairs so maybe that was the reason for <unk> slow service but there 's zero chance of me returning .

4 great deal on great food for restaurant week !
3 make sure you ask the guys at the counter for the $ 4.99 combo deal which includes a <unk> cheesesteak , yummy fries and drink . this deal is normally close to $ 10 so the coupon makes it a bargain . their after 4pm $ 9 cheese pizza deal
3 if you can ignore the moody servers , you 'll enjoy the pizza here .
3 i wish all airlines have no change fees ! i love the positive attitude of the flight crew ! tip : sit in the exit row and be willing to help in the event of the emergency ! gals : do n't wear flip flops or 5 inch heels on
3 start your lunch/dinner with their <unk> <unk> 's chocolate sheet cake -- it is very good ! i prefer their sandwiches and orzo salad !
2 i hope the replacement becomes a real grocery store with <unk> items . i will miss their yummy sandwiches and salads !
3 you will wait ... always ... i could eat a pound of their hash browns . i get them to go !
4 <unk> makes the most wonderful cappuccinos in the valley ! very chill place to relax or to use their wifi . steve , the owner , appreciates all his customers ' feedback !
4 the chili verde is great hear . i also got to meet the manager at the local first az festival this past weekend . their butternut squash soup and sourdough bread are amazing .
2 their quality suffers when the crowds come in at 1-2 a.m. \ go in the afternoon for their $ 5.50 -- a good deal !
4 great lunch . i went here with a friend from work because of a bogo coupon he had . the lunch was fantastic . i had a rice bowl with raw fish on top with mixed <unk> and mushrooms mixed in . the flavor was just right with enough savory
4 this is my place for great thin crust ny style pizza . fast , cheap and super yummy . my whole family loves this place . we <unk> get a cheese pie and a sausage pie . both are 18 '' $ 13 for the cheese pie and an extra
3 the highly touted garlic fries were a let down . the meal otherwise was just a normal chain standard meal . it was good but for me not good enough to go back .
2 this is a sushi on a rotating belt place . just pick what you want and pay by the plate . the sushi was ok , you get what you pay for . i liked how clean it was and the service was great . what i could see an

3 what a fun place in scottsdale . dinner and a movie you cant beat that . plus drinks . on the plus side the food was very good . if you stay with sandwiches you can get away with a dinner for 10 bucks and under for one person plus
2 beer good ! atmosphere fun ! good place to eat outside if its a nice day . food good but overpriced . i had <unk> and it was ok but for the money not worth it . the service was pretty good and the staff knowledgeable about german beers and
1 food : i am not a vegetarian or vegan , so maybe i do not have the mindset to appreciate this place . <unk> a vegetarian restaurant is a good idea , there are plenty of vegetarians . but why is everything on their menu a mock of regular ,
2 food : i do n't know why cornish pasty is listed as british food . most of the choices of pasties are not british at all . for those of you who do n't know what a pasty is , it 's basically a baked pastry case filled with your

3 my review only is for the <unk> bar that is ironically in the <unk> corner of the store . got ta love a grocery store with 35 taps and $ 10 pizzas -lrb- on thursdays -rrb- ! fantastic beer selection with an emphasis on locals . i 'd like to
3 papago really is a great place . dozens of tap handles , hundreds of beers in the cooler and a basic but quite good menu . the only thing keeping that 5th star away , is that the place has a dirty feel . not old or modest or even

1 i wanted to like the parlor too . it has a nice cool vibe with modern decor . i 've heard great things about the food and that the service was sub-par and to say sub-par is an understatement . in my opinion our service totally sucked . here 's
4 here is why i have to give this place 5 stars . my husband and i started making delux our `` date lunch '' place every tuesday a few months ago . -lrb- see we have two kids and rarely get to eat without the little ones -rrb- . since
4 i ca n't get enough of this place ! everything i have tried on the menu is absolutely amazing . the food was seasoned perfectly and the drinks were mixed well . i love the ability to never feel full even though i ate too much ...

2 you can always count on the british open pub as a great place to watch a sports game -- you 'll always have a tv available . maybe it 's because it 's sandwiched in the papago plaza is not always the most happenin ' place . but that does
2 i 'm always excited when new bars open up at tempe marketplace , and i headed to bar louie this past wednesday . lucky us -- wednesday 's at bar louie means $ 1 domestic drafts , which is quite the great deal . we sat on the patio ,
3 i 've seen many reviews of this place , i finally have gotten the opportunity to go ! my friend and i were lucky to not be <unk> by the iffy service i 've heard about in other reviews . we were greeted quickly , and served very quickly .
3 honestly , this place looks like it should be crowded with moose <unk> ... the help looks a little ... well , she 's probably seen better days , but very friendly and prompt . think `` beauty school <unk> '' hits 60 ... this place has a killer jukebox
4 went to grimaldi 's tonight , and i thought it was fabulous ! my friend and i got the pizza of the month -- the bbq chicken pizza . this was one of the best pizza 's i 've ever had . the veggies were nice and crunchy , and

1 been here twice and probably wo n't go back , unless i only have margaritas . the food was great the first time and very sub-par the second , especially for the price of the tacos . the pork ones were especially gross ; extremely greasy and fatty and tasteless

3 grabbed a quick bite here with my girl amanda before hitting up a concert downtown , and the food was so tasty we should have just skipped the concert and stayed at the restaurant ! i got the drunken noodle - ordered it mild -lrb- i believe you can order
4 although this joint is by far one of the best restaurants not kept secret - i wanted to share my delicious experience with their temporary summer menu , <unk> in their regular menu . we ordered the `` fried cauliflower '' - it has now become a <unk> craving -lrb-
0 gross . wife did n't even bother to take <unk> . place does not look clean . a warning sign for us should have been that this `` mexican '' place is staffed with gringo servers . every quesadilla we ordered arrived soggy , not a single item we ordered
3 always awesome , especially the shrimp grits & margarita ! also love the shrimp po ' boy . desserts are great too . place is nice but casual . modern but comfortable . huge <unk> bar is great place to hang out , eat and drink . patio is great

3 wow , that is great panang curry ! impressively wonderful smell too . it is <unk> that i 've not managed to make it back in a while . it just is n't on my normal route .
3 wow that <unk> is terrific ! love everything we 've had there . nice place , great energy here on a saturday night . great drinks , food is reasonably priced , $ 11 - 17 entrees
3 this is my favorite sushi restaurant . i 'm always completely blown away by the sushis presentation , taste , and well ... everything . <unk> been replaced by a much cheaper sushi restaurant but i still think fondly of sakana . easily the best sushi in arizona . just
2 i went here a few days after they opened to check it out with my cousin . the donuts were alright . nothing extraordinary about them . i saw a sign that said , `` we do boba tea '' so i asked the girl what kind of teas came
1 i 've always been a fan of mimis but it had been about three years since my last visit . my mother and grandpa decided they wanted to do lunch there and i was happy about it . i remembered the location in mesa being better but since i used
3 i love their food . it 's probably the best jewish deli food i 've had since i left the east coast . -lrb- i actually prefer it here -rrb- that being said i have a bias and hatred for new york and i ca n't stand the ny style
3 ive got ta say , after a few years of the community getting used to the idea of a fresh and easy ... this location is much better ! n
4 i am telling you that this is my favorite summer place ! the fro yo is amazing and the place is so clean it looks like you really could use the five second rule here . i wo n't but okay . the interior is not only clean but it
2 pretty good mexican food . great cheap margs -lrb- just like chi chi 's used to make ! -rrb- and really great bean dip to go with the chips . yum . love the sour cream chicken <unk> combo . the fajitas look very good as well . service is
4 it 's a little on the pricey side but you can be assured that your meal is free of gluten and that 's worth a lot in my book ! the owner of this establishment works well with the gf community to ensure his staff is trained in cross <unk>
3 pretty darn good lunch ! good fresh food , excellent service so i was pleasantly surprised . the only thing is that by the time you pay for each little individual thing , i think the value of the family dinners at maggiano 's far exceed the value here .
4 first off , if you 're coming from the west on indian school pay attention to the sign that says milagro grill is in 400 yards or feet or whatever it says . otherwise it 's sort of hard to find . the address is <unk> e. indian school .
2 i am kind of frustrated by this place , some things are very good and some are just so-so . my wife had the orange chicken and ordered it spicy . it was very tasty . the bbq pork has a good flavor but it riddled with fat . the
1 i have tried chompie 's 3 times that will probably be all for me . today it was a half turkey sandwich , soup and slaw . the slaw of ok but tiny . the chicken noodle was way to heavy on celery and light on carrots and onion .
1 maybe i am not a texas bbq fan . the brisket was fairly well cooked but the crust was charred and bitter . turkey sample was moist . the pork samples were very fatty and the pulled pork is very vinegar laden . potato salad was decent and standard .
3 i 'm a huge fan of the duce because it has great sliders and cheap beer . the setting is different but very enjoyable . my recommendation is to get a brisket sliders with a miller high life . you will be loving life after that . if you are
4 the pizza is great . you should order <unk> 's favorite . the <unk> and glendale locate has 1/2 price pitchers on thursdays . do n't miss out on great pizza and great service . it is all about the food not location . so this place gets 5 stars
3 i 'm a huge fan of chicken and waffles . this location is a upgrade from the phoenix location . for the california people , this is not roscoes chicken and waffle but it it is a arizona alternative . if you are in scottsdale and want some pretty good
4 my favorite sushi spot , the food is great , i would recommend the <unk> roll , the chimi <unk> , and the surfer ... they are great ! the atmosphere is also very good ! i 'm not the biggest fan of sushi but <unk> place really gets me
1 chompie 's used to be one of my favs , i used to eat there all the time a couple of years ago , today i went to the shea location , which i always used to goto & it was pathetic . . ordered the `` aaron '' sandwich
4 i just got back from italy couple of months ago & have n't been able to eat any pizza here since ... finally remembered i went to grimaldis in old town years back & liked it ... tried the one in scottsdale quarter by my house & it was even
2 i like zoes . it could be that my lunch options are limited during the work day . but regardless i like going here when i am craving healthy food . i usually get the greek salad - hold the chicken ! and it is good . i have also
1 i guess if you are stoned anything will taste good . unfortunatly when i visited this place i was not , and <unk> this place kind of grossed me out . the food was quite bad in my <unk> . the fries were n't crunchy and did n't have any
4 delux rocks !! i always get the grilled cheese and it is delicous !! sooo good . i order take out pretty much every week from delux , and my bf always gets the ` delux burger ' it is soo good too . the mixed fries are so tasty
3 i really love this place . breakfast and lunch are both stellar , you ca n't go wrong with anything you get . i do n't live close enough to frequent as often as i would like , but when we go out that way we always make a stop
3 everyone says this place is so great and i would say that 's true . i took a friend of mine there and she ordered a spaghetti stuffed calzone and i ordered a personal pizza , i believe it was called <unk> . my friend raved about how hers was
4 ive heard rave reviews about this place for years and last night was my first experience at lgo . we ordered the baked chicken wings , and two pizzas ; the gladiator and the avocado pizza . all three items were delicious , my favorite being the avocado pizza ,
3 what kind of self <unk> restaurant and bar closes at 11pm on a saturday ?? st. francis does ! ridiculous . now , you may ask : `` what does this have to do with ticoz ?? '' good question ... i went to st. francis at 11:15 on saturday
4 ummm yes . they had dogfish head 's <unk> touch in stock . are you <unk> . no sir , im not . this may be called `` another <unk> '' in downtown , but its those houses that make downtown phx a decent place . walking up to this
2 after living 2 blocks away for over a year , i finally took the jump and decided to deal with the long wait to try this place out . got there at 7:30 on a tuesday night ... 2.5 hour wait . -lrb- to be expected , but still pretty
4 i have totally fallen in love at tuck shop . everything here is fantastic . my friend and i come here about twice a month and enjoy some snacks and wine . the beer battered cheese curds may just change your life for the better ... we are seriously tempted
0 i seriously can not recommend the food served here . i was enticed to eat at this new downtown location because i had been so impressed with the french fries served at their south phoenix restaurant . the fries served here were terrible . my dining partner commented on how
3 i 'm so happy that chandler has its own brewpub , and san tan is a fine one at that . for starters , the atmosphere is friendly . the staff make a point of introducing <unk> and shaking your hand if you 're a newcomer . i 've walked
4 your one-stop destination for all the cajun food you 've been craving . met up with friends here for a wednesday night outing , so that we could try their boiled crawfish . i have to say that this is crawfish done right ... and at $ 3.95 / lb
2 upon my first visit to <unk> , i liked the casual ambience and the outdoor patio . the oysters on the half shell were exceptional , especially with the house-made fresh -lrb- and potent ! -rrb- horseradish . kinda <unk> up your <unk> and makes you say `` boy ...
1 i never got a chance to try vitamin t at this location , but the mexican fare on the menu drew me in for a quick lunch in the downtown phoenix area . on the plus side , the service was fast and efficient and the food was reasonably priced
4 i never go here alone because i like introducing friends to joe 's farm grill for the first time . this is for several reasons : 1 -rrb- it 's a beautiful farm atmosphere in what some consider `` the middle of the desert '' 2 -rrb- it was featured
3 my endless quest for righteous food truck <unk> has <unk> <unk> with my search for great cajun food ! i first sampled some of jamburritos offerings at the 2010 great cajun <unk> and food fest and was thrilled to find out that they would soon launch their food truck in
4 this is obviously the best pizza ever . my choice of pizza is the marinara -lrb- no cheese -rrb- with olives . it 's beyond delicious . this is quality pizza guys ! i 'm seeing all these reviews with complaints that the pizza is `` burnt . '' it
4 amazing ! i love this place ! such friendly products ! good for the body ! the people there are such great friendly people too !
4 i 've eaten here a couple of times . it 's good and the staff is very nice . i order the beet burger which always hits the spot . i will continue going back when i am craving something thats not too light , but also not too heavy

3 <unk> does n't blow by the rue what is it about this place , that makes me want to stuff my face , i do n't even wait to say grace , `` tina eat the food '' without leaving a <unk> . let me drop onto you some <unk>
2 we go here after softball games on thursday night . the drinks are cheap , the food is great , and the service is outstanding . the biggest draw to this place is the bar itself . it has lots of pool tables and dart boards , two huge patios
1 ok , this is a sam fox <unk> for sure . i am not the biggest fan of his <unk> but some of them are decent like culinary dropout or olive and ivy , but this place is just ehh . first off , it is <unk> overpriced . $
3 i like this place for lunch . it is <unk> inexpensive , and healthy as you can get a wrap and side -lrb- choice of soup , pasta salad , or fruit -rrb- for about $ 7 . everything there seems fresh , they have quick service and a unique
2 i have passed by this place a bunch of times and finally decided to stop in and give it a try . the service was good and so was the sushi . the only drawback is that the place has no ambiance and no full bar . it was also
2 i have been here 3 times and i am torn between 3 and 4 stars . i have had a good meal here everytime but somethings are much better than others . lets start with the <unk> , which would be almost every sandwich or burger they have on the
3 decent price , decent size , great ingredients and great taste . this is so much better than subway , silver mine or any other quick sandwich place out here . good to see this midwest staple finally arrive . now all we need is good deep dish pizza and
3 even though roy 's is a nationwide chain , it 's a pretty nice chain , built from the hard work of <unk> roy <unk> , whose <unk> dishes <unk> the spirit of hawaiian cuisine . a nice perk of making reservations here online is that they offer <unk> opentable
3 excellent jerk prawns . the seasoning was perfect , and while they were spicy , they were n't so spicy i could n't enjoy the meal . the sides the prawns were served with were good as well -lrb- coleslaw , grilled corn , <unk> -rrb- . the beverages they

3 a well-stocked trader joe 's that carries fresh and tasty produce , <unk> , boxed , dairy , and freezer foods . you can always find something good to stock your fridge or pantry with here . they also have great deals on wine . service has always been cheerful
3 delicious , fresh , flavorful , with a lot of meat and vegetarian options to please any discerning palate . they also offer soups and salads , which i hear are equally as delicious , and many different options for sides . it 's sad to see that this plaza
3 went here again for dinner and a movie . i had the turkey burger , which was quite good , with the sweet potato fries . my husband indulged in the wednesday all you can eat pizza special . for a little less than 10 dollars , you can choose
3 weekends here are very busy , but there is good reason why ! we got here around <unk> , and while there were a lot of people waiting for tables around the entrance , it took ~ 15-20 minutes for our number to be called for a party of 4
4 very good lunch specials , and the food here in general is delicious . the lunch specials include drink and are very reasonably priced . service was great . the vegetarian dishes are the best to get here , and the injera is always good . i like blue nile
3 a picturesque locale with good sandwiches and beverages . since the seating is outdoors , this does limit the times when i feel like coming here , since your enjoyment level of eating here will partially depend on the weather .
4 as with other someburros locations , they serve up excellent food at an inexpensive price . the chorizo burro had a good <unk> of meat to egg and potato , and was very flavorful , especially paired with the salsa they serve . the salsa here seems to be tastier
3 wow , this in-n-out was packed to the gills on friday night ! despite it being so busy , there was n't any wait to place our order , and there were still seats left for us to enjoy our meal . even though they were slammed with orders ,

3 went here for hot pot . they offer 5 or 6 types of broth -lrb- $ 2 -rrb- including satay , szechwan , and mongolian . there are a lot of different meats and vegetables to choose from that you choose a la carte and mark down on a sheet
3 freshly brewed sodas ! they have a special `` <unk> '' which is butterscotch soda if you are a harry potter nerd , and a seasonal pumpkin pie float which is rich , creamy , <unk> , and delicious . when you are seated , you can sample some of
3 i love the salt cellar for being the lazy woman 's go-to place for seafood . if you get lobster or crab from them , the waitress will crack and <unk> it for you ; it 's such a great service since a lot of the time i am hesitant
3 it seems like <unk> has been around forever , and there 's good reason why ! it 's a great place to cool off for adults and kids alike . they have a mix of exciting slides , as well as gentle floating tube rides . the golfland part of

3 rich and decadent gelato at reasonable prices . while the <unk> flavors will be a bit more icy than smooth , the <unk> ones are the perfect smooth texture . the flavors are not overly strong , which is fine with me since i will usually have a combination of
3 mido sushi is great ! they have an excellent deal for happy hour , which is all day from <unk> , and from 11:30 -5 on friday and saturday . nigiri sushi and rolls are 1/2 price . the happy hour menu for sushi is pretty extensive , and a

4 cute little restaurant that serves up an excellent chai latte . service was cheerful and very friendly , and they offer almond milk as well as soy for milk alternatives . i was even given a sample of the chai concentrate to try out before it was made for me
3 after trying various menu items , my favorites are still the breakfast burritos -lrb- either with bacon if you are in a meaty mood , or the bean with added potato -rrb- , the shrimp diablo burrito -lrb- <unk> and spicy ! -rrb- , and surprisingly , the veggie burrito
3 delicious dolsot bim bim <unk> and decent selection of <unk> - they have most of the standard type you will find at a korean restaurant -lrb- kimchee , bean sprouts , etc -rrb- . the bim bim <unk> had a very wide selection of veggies in it , neatly and

2 this place is always ridiculously busy . their food , pretty good , but due to the wait that is usually involved i usually steer clear of this place . we went here very early -lrb- ~ 4 pm -rrb- for our large party to get seated and there was

3 describing the lost leaf , i feel like i should n't like it ... but i really really do . there is no signage out front so i was very timid approaching from the outside but once i did boy was i glad . most of the art i have
4 es <unk> <unk> <unk> ! that 's german ! i have been to haus murphy 's to drink a few times in the past and was quite pleased by the beer selection as well as the size . i can get beer in a <unk> the size of my head
4 my favorite thing about the phoenix art museum is that they manage to showcase southwestern art without it being the total theme of the museum . i am not much of a fan of cowboy <unk> and whatnot but i can appreciate them when i can also cart around to
3 the grape vine is one of the best venues in az to catch a nathan s. show and believe me everyone should experience a nathan s. show at some point in their lives . he is as talented and energetic a performer as the world has ever seen . i
4 this is one of my favorite little places . i always feel comfortable here . the atmosphere is quaint and the food is damned good and affordable . it makes a terrific date place . good for conversation . the desserts always look terrific but i never save room .
3 my wife and i were down at the phoenix market the other evening and had the pleasure of enjoying one one torched goodness creme <unk> ! it is a treat to watch them prep this dessert with their blow torch in front of you . it was $ 4.00 ,
3 this place is sooo conveniently close to my office ... it 's hard not to go to often . but , as other reviewers have stated its a little pricey for a `` fast food '' style burger joint . granted that this is no mcdonalds !! but ... in
4 all i needed to complete my delicious meal here was a good cuban cigar and some brandy ! we had the papa <unk> for an appetizer ... very very good . its a beef filled potato cake with a cilantro lime sauce . for entrees my wife and i shared
4 love nicks ! i have been coming here for many years ... and the food has always been really good ... at really reasonable prices . i tend to stick with the pasta dishes ... as all the pasta is fresh and homemade . my favorite dish on the menu
0 sorry , but i have to do this . i have had good sushi experiences so many times at this place , but one <unk> event really helps to wipe those memories away . i got food poisoning from the sushi bar . i know it was the sushi bar
3 obviously whole foods is losing an entire star due to the <unk> high prices , however : i go there for things i ca n't get anywhere else and i know that . they have me in a <unk> . they have the best goddamn salad <unk> <unk> . there
1 i feel conflicted about this store . i 've gone there on and off over the years and have over that time spent hundreds of dollars there , but i still feel irked about some really sub-par customer service . every time i pass it and consider going in ,
3 mmmmmmmmm chico 's . i consider chico 's to be on the high end of the filiberto 's / <unk> 's / <unk> 's type places . it 's good , fast , cheap mexican food that is heavy and greasy and you want to be sure to have no
3 so far -lrb- after two visits -rrb- i love it here . armed with a menu , i called down to place a `` to go '' order . you ca n't begin to imagine my delight when the guy answered the phone in a french accent so thick it
3 holy crap that 's a good burger ! hot damn them 's good french fries ! i 'll be a monkey 's uncle , that 's some quick service ! unfortunately , the condiment bar kinda grossed me out , and they were out of coke . who runs out
2 i had a really hard time picking how many stars to give it . on the one hand , it gets 5 stars for the look and feel of the place , the phosphate soda and shake that made me wish i could expand like a <unk> , the jukebox
3 i love fresh & easy . i could really just stop right there . but i wo n't . i 've loved living across the street from f & e for the past 21/2 years , and when i move -lrb- soon -rrb- , i 'm going to really miss
4 i honestly ca n't get enough of this place ! i could drink their -lrb- giant -rrb- peach margaritas and eat their -lrb- warm and wonderful -rrb- tortilla chips every single day for the rest of my life : -rrb- their food <unk> from the typical ` mexican ' fare
1 so , after reading all of the lovely reviews , jamie and i tried sushi eye last night ... and i must ask of you who loved this place : have you ever had great sushi ? i mean -- phenomenal sushi ? because the rave reviews highly overrated this
4 i absolutely love what they are doing at nobuo . we came first for restaurant week and then again last month with family in town . the dining style is like asian tapas , so you can try small tastes of a variety of food , and wash it down
3 crackers & co cafe is good , but every time i go something just is n't quite fulfilling , and i ca n't put my finger on it . it 's not that i do n't enjoy the food , or the awesome chili and tortilla soup . i guess
3 great wings . delicious potato skins . $ 2.75 large drafts <unk> from 10pm to close . the best part about santisi is the food and drafts . they have friendly and cute servers and one sexy one . nonetheless , getting your first order can take awhile their customer
0 first , if your a dodgers fan you will love this park . i 'm a <unk> fan and love the game of baseball in general especially spring training . we went to the friday night game and watched the dodgers and the giants . it was a good game
4 i am not one to hang out in downtown phoenix before or after an event because quite frankly it 's boring . however , when i visited copper blues on <unk> prior to the comedy show next door i will definitely be hanging out after events . here 's why
2 i am mildly impressed with the fact that the attempt to be a vegas - style casino in arizona is long overdue here in the valley of the slots . this is not a pass , but rather a visit that will allow you to feel like you are in
3 and it was a very late night when i realized that if i did not eat something , i would not be able to truly enjoy a glass of wine . a friend of mine said ... i know a place ... and you know that when you hear that
4 so soon since <unk> <unk> <unk> to seek <unk> in this <unk> economic situation , i found the syrupy soaked security of a seemingly `` regulars '' secret scene to <unk> in mutual <unk> ! my eyes were bigger than my stomach as each word on the menu left me
2 i have to say that this place is a novelty . it brings us to a place of <unk> and makes us want to brand something and sing by a campfire . the fare is overall `` ehh '' . i go out of my way to bring people like
4 anytime i can get live greek music and saganaki and <unk> ... i am compelled to <unk> many stars ! the people are sweet , the patio is fortunately positioned for good people watching , and the menu has something for even your pickiest of eaters ! come here and
4 nobody told me about ordering '' double double animal style '' but when i caught on to what the locals were doing , i jumped right in and have not been able to do it any other way at this nifty retro keeping it simple burger house ! nobody makes
2 just got back from los taquitos . picked up the 3 tacos combo . i got two fish and one shrimp with rice and beans for $ 6.75 plus tax and i also got a horchata . there are a couple thing i want to address . first off ,
1 i usually love this place . really good breakfast burritos and tacos . however today i found a short curly black hair nestled in my machaca burrito and had to throw it away immediately and now i feel ill . this really sucks since i liked this place a lot
2 this is a decent place . i came here some time ago because i had a restaurant.com certificate , and the bf and i needed to use it up . the best part were the margaritas - tasty and <unk> . i ca n't remember what i got , only
3 i sometimes feel like i give too many 4 star reviews , but this place really was quite good . so we 'll call it 3.5 rounded up to 4 . we came here for a friend 's engagement party . it 's a bit hard to find , and
4 just checked out the arrogant butcher this evening with the boyfriend . the place was surprisingly crowded - a very good sign . we were seated very promptly , and our waiter was very quick to come up and talk to us about the restaurant and the food . we
3 when i first entered the w scottsdale i <unk> myself for the cheesy club music that i 've developed a love-hate relationship with at my home away from home , the w in san francisco . unfortunately -lrb- or perhaps fortunately -rrb- , i was n't greeted with such music
3 kimpton does it again ... this time with the firesky resort and spa . i think they teach a course on how to be nice to people here because all their employees are so nice . and not even in a creepy too nice way ... they actually all seemed
2 for a tuesday night this was one popular spot ! we had reservations for a party of 4 at 7:15 , but our reservation time came and went while we were waiting at the bar . we probably would have waited even longer if one member of our party had
3 during my few trips to phoenix -lrb- particularly the scottsdale area -rrb- i always find myself thinking that it reminds me a lot of boca <unk> , florida -lrb- where i grew up -rrb- , but with mountains . and personally i think the mountains make phoenix so much cooler
4 i 'm going to try and not <unk> it here . i love steve 's espresso . maybe there are fancier coffee shops out there . i 'm not going to say this is the best coffee shop in the world . but it * is * the best one
2 i really like pei wei . but you have to understand what it is . it is a chain . it is not quite fast food , but not quite a restaurant . it is rarely great , but almost never bad . it 's consistent , like most chains
3 i was torn on my rating here . the food is 4 star easy , the overall experience is slightly less - i 'd love to give it 3.5 . but the food was just that good , so i 'd rather round up than down . if you did
3 i 've been here a few times and could n't resist the temptation when i saw a yelp deal for phoenicia . i 'm a huge fan of this style of food and they do everything very well here . the two times i have come here my gf and
1 for the price , the wine is n't bad . they advertise it being a local winery but i think it mostly come from new mexico . if you want decent az wine check out the selection at wf or aj 's . they have some that are much better
4 i have lived here for nearly 10 years . i acquired my sushi addiction back in <unk> and am always in search of some good quality fish . most places in az are a dime a dozen . nothing special , completely average and nothing to separate one from another
1 i 'm going to write this place off as just one of those things in which mesa patrons are just not capable of giving accurate info when it comes to sushi . our experience ? pretty terrible . i have a few standbys i get everywhere to compare . one
2 we have been looking for a sushi joint a little closer to my place in tempe that is a little more convenient then our favorite place -lrb- shimogamo in chandler -rrb- . as we walked in we heard the men behind the sushi bar yell something out -lrb- they did
4 i was so pleasantly surprised with the breakfast club . i wanted to take my mom to a nice brunch on a monday ... and i thought the orange table . we walked in there and they stopped breakfast at 11 , so i knew that i never went to
3 went to see local bands play here last night with amy d and her awesome friends . totally my kind of bar ... dark , dirty , divey , and with killer bands playing . very spacious ... but that could have something to do with the fact that the
3 i wish i was a beer drinker . but alas , i am not . but the people that i was with on friday were and they had nothing but great things to say about the beer selection . i had cider ... which really does n't tell you much
4 i would have never known that this place even existed if i was n't invited out to breakfast this morning after my grueling -lrb- but so awesome -rrb- bike ride this morning . it is n't the easiest place to find if you are n't looking for it . service
2 not very impressed . let me start of with the concession stands ... `` do you have any <unk> water ? '' `` uhhh ... i am closed up . but the dude across the way can get you some . '' so i walk to the `` dude ''
2 they definitely have the italian grocery store thing down pat . service was pleasant though really really slow . i decided to get the chicken cheesesteak ... it was good , but was n't the best i have ever had . the pasta salad was good though it could have
3 i am on a roll when it comes to trying new -lrb- well to me anyway -rrb- cuisine across the valley . today at work , my coworker and wonderful friend vicky mentioned how she wanted to try <unk> kitchen . i went on yelp , read the reviews -lrb-
3 first things first ... i love meat ! i will never become a vegan or a vegetarian . but i am not going to turn my nose to a restaurant that serves vegan/vegetarian options only . i loved the cool ambiance that green offers . the staff is super friendly
3 okay , it was a couple of weeks ago . went there with a couple of friends . yummy food , great curry , great portion of soup , but the sticky rice dessert , yummy , yummy , yummy . saw the lines to wait when we were leaving
3 tried after a movie , got lost , but called and glad i did . loved all the sushi , and ordered miso soup , agedashi tofu -lrb- no broth , so just fried tofu -rrb- , will be back for the other soups -lrb- <unk> & gyoza -rrb- .
3 since i am asian-american ; the only place i will rate a 5star is my mother 's home cooking . but , since she is far away ; i will got to places like china chili . the honey walnut prawns , singapore rice noodles , and the soups keep
3 had the hot & spicy sichuan prawns , expecting too hot , but had the right kind of spice ! yum , yum , yummy . wish the would chinese fried chicken more often , last time i tried to order , they had run out , so had crispy
3 i like golden buddha , have taken many friends there for dim sum . try not to `` hit '' the dumpling cart to heavy ; otherwise can not finish it to the dessert cart -lrb- lol -rrb- . love the jasmine tea and the staff willing to help you
3 okay , reading reviews of hana 's ; maybe i 'm not an expert ... just know what i like . i love hana japanese eatery . the poke is something i must get everytime . the specials on the board are always great to try . the staff is
3 have been going to the osf since the early 90 's ... i think i have had almost every dish on the menu ... very <unk> good ; the pasta is done <unk> just like my roommate prefers . love the new spaghetti squash side dish !!! yum , yum
3 my only complaint is that it 's too small and too far away from my house : -rrb- good beer , cheap martinis , pool table , friendly staff what more could you want ?
3 good things first : fresh baked bread from <unk> 's bakery is fluffy and delicious . lux coffee means local support and a good taste -lrb- barista style coffee -rrb- organic ingredients -lrb- as far as i know -rrb- for most of their produce original recipes for dressings and such
3 ok so the service is decent yet slow but it 's all soooo worth it just for one reason : they have these new cream cheese and bacon filled <unk> with a <unk> syrup drizzle that is like thailand and the waffle house made the <unk> . they are to
3 well carolina 's is just freaking yummy . it 's so good . it 's also so cheaply priced ! the menu is varied , the take out is fast , and the staff is friendly . they have a salsa bar and varied soda machine . i have to
4 chase field really is my favorite stadium in az . . i shall always refer to it as `` the bob '' , though this shows my age quite a bit . the stadium is clean , modern , has a diverse selection of food/drinks , and -lrb- yep -rrb-
2 i 'm so conflicted here , that i will just add the pros and cons and land in the middle with my rating . uncle sam 's has what is arguably the cheapest happy hour drinks in all the valley . beer is a buck a pint and a half
3 this is just overall a great place ! it 's tough to do this review , as i can probably only remember 1/2 of my times being here , and that is being generous . there 's something about the atmosphere here that just makes you want to tie one
4 i am very impressed with this place . the unique decor and inside / outside set up of tables was a nice change from the ordinary . this place feels like a cottage -- very homey . for lunch on a saturday , the place was packed -- i think
4 my favorite upscale sushi in scottsdale . the w hotel is beautiful and roku is no different . the vibe is upbeat with trendy music playing in the background . everyone in the restaurant is sexy and dressed to impress . great date place or <unk> place in walking distance
3 nice , hip secret locale for gourmet sandwiches and good beer choices . the place always feels a little dirty -- which i think is their intent . this is a nice little place if you want to grab a quick bite to eat and a drink before an event
3 burgers are phenomenal ... order one with `` half and half '' and get a generous portion of fries and onion rings . my favorite sports bar in old town .
3 check out geisha any time sunday for great specials on food and alcohol ... good vibe ... pretty people and dj type music on . great place to roll into in shorts or dressed up . many different types of sake make this place stand out .
2 overpriced . a burger , drink , and fries was $ 17 . still , the food was tasty and the location is great .
4 great vibe ! i was there on a tuesday -- the first time i have been since the bar has changed owners . first of all , it was packed on both sides -- a good sign that this spot will make it . posh crowd in the typical downtown
3 great little bar in arcadia . the burger was exceptional . top notch . nothing real fancy here , just a great , simple concept with delicious ingredients . i will say , i ordered my burger <unk> but it came out med - well . still , it was
4 thoroughly impressed with this place . we were in for dinner on a wednesday and the dining area was crowded and vibrant . the decor is better than average for an indian restaurant . the service was superb and he was honest with his opinions . he told us not
3 i 've been to this place a few times since i moved to the area . it 's a great `` dive-y '' bar with a lot of open space and tables . i 'm a big fan of playing shuffleboard , so that is definitely a plus . drink
2 i went here with a few friends looking to get some appetizers , sushi , and saki bombs . when we walked in , it was pretty packed so we asked the hostess how long it might take to get a table for five . she basically said she had
1 meh . that 's about it . the menu is small , but i guess that 's because they are centered around their `` awesome carne asada . '' it 's nothing special . the corn was good , though . not worth about a 25 minute wait for takeout
4 this my jam ! when i moved from tempe to downtown phoenix , i was a little devastated that i would be out of reach of my home away from home , gold bar . but ' t was ok because i worked the night shift , so most independent
1 the only reason i come here ... it 's closer to me than the one in tempe . otherwise , i would recommend the tempe be . the quality of clothes are better & the prices are better . i actually see <unk> brand shirts with tags from ross priced
3 i 'll update to 4 stars . i have been back several times , and it 's a very good location if you meeting up with a group of people . variety of drinks , reasonable prices . they have a sampler plate for $ 4 , comes with nuts
4 tuesday night wine and bruschetta special <unk> ! i love postino 's just for that . $ 20 gets you a bottle of wine and a tray of bruschetta . this is an awesome deal . my girlfriends and i love it . we can sit and talk and indulge
3 i decided one day to work outside the office . i had to concentrate on some writing and sometimes my work is not the best place to do that because i share an office . i decided to go to <unk> , but was <unk> . i saw <unk> and
4 teakwoods is awesome and awesome for a variety of reasons . aside from the fact that they are huge supporter of my work at crisis nursery , their food is so yummy . i love the pretzels and if anything , you should go in there just for that .
4 thanks to chris l 's first review , otfm has been on my list of places to go for quite some time . unfortunately , i just ca n't seem to get my act together on saturday mornings . today was the day . i was ready by 9 -lrb-
2 if it were n't for the fact i usually walk out of here with money , i would give this casino 2 stars . i only come here when my mom is visiting . she likes this location because she usually wins . i usually lose . however , my
3 we just returned from the 4th of july red , wright , and blue event . not sure if publicly advertised as we received a card in the mail since we have a membership . this particular event was $ 60 a ticket . that bought a tour , food
1 i do n't know what possessed me to eat here . maybe i thought if it was good enough for george <unk> , it would be good enough for me . i expected grease , i expected a lackluster interior , and i expected mediocre food . i guess it
3 if location were the only criteria , jade palace would get 10 stars . conveniently located next to sweet republic , jade palace offers the perfect opportunity to suggest chinese for dinner , knowing you 'll end up with heaven for dessert . probably 3.5 stars , but feeling generous
3 while i appreciate a good steak occasionally , i do n't appreciate $ 9 baked potatoes . i 'm sorry , but if i 'm paying $ 40 for a piece of meat , is it too much to ask to throw in the potato ? this <unk> has eliminated
2 well i guess i 'm going to be in the minority here and say that i was somewhat disappointed . not too much , but a little . it is ridiculously inexpensive , and for the money , i thought the food was decent . we started with the <unk>
2 a solid 3.5 stars for my first visit , if that were an option . when 5th and wine dared to close over memorial weekend , my friend and fellow yelper , christina p , suggested cd as an alternative . trying to grasp onto those last few days of
2 after visit # 2 for dinner this time , i 'm knocking off a star . same menu as lunch . this time we had soft pretzels for our appetizer . i guess i 'm spoiled by the soft pretzels at beaver street in flagstaff , because i was really
4 <unk> vanilla with a toasted marshmallow . perfection in my book !
3 masterfully created artisan ice creams made in small batches from only the freshest , local ingredients ... you wo n't find that at sugar bowl . if that 's what you 're looking for , head to sweet republic . those gals are the masters of ice cream . but
3 i had passed on big earl 's once previously after seeing the reviews were all over the place . it goes back to my `` what if this is my last meal , and it 's a two star experience '' <unk> . but after the yelp event , we
1 i do n't claim to be an expert on good bbq . in fact , i did n't eat much of it until i married my husband , a southern boy . i 've since learned what i like and lucille 's is not it . we stopped in for
4 if you 've never been to the luminarias or have n't been in a few years , this is the year to go ! it 's a 2 for 1 deal with the chihuly exhibit . the garden is filled with his glass sculptures perfectly displayed among the natural elements
3 as far as salad bar buffets go , i find sweet tomatoes to be well above average . my pet peeve at salad bars is wilted or <unk> greens . i 've eaten at this location many times and the produce has always been <unk> in the salads that are
2 well <unk> me , i ate at pei wei ! is n't the 11th <unk> `` thou <unk> not eat pseudo asian food at chain restaurants ? '' forgive me father yelp for i have sinned . that 's the extent of my religious knowledge btw . so i 've
2 wanting to try something new , we opted for lunch here . judging by the reviews , i 'm not sure if they were having an off day or whether what we ordered was really a good representation of peruvian food . we ordered fried <unk> , and the server
3 my first experience with pcg was at a small , yet fantastic yelp event . i 've been back twice and have been just as impressed . the first time was for brunch , and i recommend the griddled corn cakes . no , i just do n't recommend them
2 3.5 while i 'm almost a fan , i should have paid better attention to the name of the restaurant when ordering . had it been julio 's mexican food & other stuff , my order would have been a wise choice . but instead i ordered a carne asada
2 food is maybe slightly above average in my opinion . i have always had great service , however . reliable place to go if you 're in the area . it makes my husband 's trips to fry 's electronics across the street more tolerable for me . last time
2 i would like to meet the <unk> that invented the concept of a self-serve gas station . thanks to that douche , society has <unk> into <unk> your own yogurt now , too . but , i wo n't <unk> a star for that since i knew this going in
2 3.5 stars with room to improve ! recently had a lovely dinner at vincitorio 's with yelp pals jim and audrey w. although there was a problem with our reservation not being carried over from one <unk> to another -lrb- huh ? -rrb- , it was easily corrected with a
1 first visit 3 stars , second visit 2 stars unfortunately . i do n't doubt the pasta is still a-ok , but i have to knock them down for their <unk> salads . i ordered a caesar with chicken . the addition of the chicken bumped the price of this
0 i am updating my review and taking five guys down to one star after my most recent visit . i found that they had raised prices yet again and had reduced portion sizes . few things anger me more as a consumer than this double hit in the wallet .
0 when the increasingly creepy <unk> jeff <unk> lost his half of the restaurant in a divorce , we had hopes that this place might actually serve normal food . jeff 's penchant had been to offer cutesy specials which were all presentation and no substance and <unk> at anyone who
4 my dutch bros. experience began at their main store at 6th and d in grants pass , oregon . the concept has translated to arizona particularly well , giving the other coffee companies a real run for their money . baristas are the friendliest , warmest people and they serve
4 i love the beet salad and date milkshakes . food is really good and love the atmosphere . tons of outdoor seating under huge trees . another good place for big groups and or bringing kids .
3 my fav current hamburger joint . rosemary fries are soooo good . normal or sweet potatoes . hamburgers are so good !! onion strings always seem <unk> though .
3 super yummy , cool ambiance . i had the bun <unk> gon and it was so good . ca n't wait to go back !!!
2 a star upgrade for the owner 's quick response ! his message was respectful and enough to get me off the fence to try joe 's real bbq at some point for a 3rd try .
4 oh that 's where i left it ! years of neglect , <unk> , <unk> has <unk> it . lack of attention has made me nearly forget it existed in the first place . i should 've gone shopping with it more often , dressed it up nice , took
4 quick review time at work ! just wow , absolutely amazing . i 've been coming here on sundays for the last two months , and i 've always had a great time , but today went to an even greater level . great adult hangout place , 4 hours
3 love it love it love it ! delicious food but always busy and hard to park ! also their hours kinda suck , so if you are n't in the area during the weekdays sorry !
3 really great food ! the orange chicken is a bit sweet so order the bourbon chicken and mix it up ! so delicious ! much better than pei wei !!
2 growing up near this little hole in the wall , this place was a constant stop for my family . it 's really good , greasy chinese food that basically tastes like you would expect it to . now that i live farther away i still have cravings for their
2 met up with some of the girls for breakfast on sunday and the place was jumping , as usual . i want to say , up front , that this place was my absolute favorite for hh a couple of years ago ... nice patio , tremendous service , and
3 i love so many things about this place ... the bloody mary is stellar , the fingerling potatoes are addictive , and i really like the `` window seat '' for large groups . the parking guys are great and the location is right in my backyard . now for
2 one of the things i love about this place is the outdoor seating in the cooler months . i also love the bellini , toasted ravioli , and <unk> pizza . there is room for improvement , however . the takeout `` system '' they are using has caused me
4 dear sierra bonita , thanks so much for accommodating a mix up in our reservation size over the weekend ! your wait staff was so helpful and pleasant , my brother -lrb- the `` <unk> '' one -rrb- was inspired to leave a 30 % tip ! i had the
3 switch , i met a good buddy there last weekend for brunch and a $ 3 bloody -lrb- quite possibly the sweetest phrase in the english language -rrb- . the special was a skillet with potatoes , eggs , house made pastrami , covered with benedict ... and holy crap
3 had my birthday dinner there on monday night and it was delish ! this high praise is a big deal because i almost never have pizza and have high expectation of the upward group as well ! the pizzas and pasta were wonderful although we over ordered for our group
3 this pub , across the street from pizzeria bianco , has a great , <unk> pub feel . nestled in an old house in heritage square , the service is prompt ad generally friendly . i went with friends for <unk> , and while i only ordered drinks -lrb- guinness
2 sun asian has an eclectic decor that makes me think of what would happen if a foreign tourist had dinner once in a pf changs , then tried to <unk> it from memory a decade later . it attempts to be trendy but ends up looking like a loft apartment
1 ` meh ... i 've experienced better ' that is the perfect way to describe my experience at hula . after reading the other reviews , i had the distinct impression that hula was the kind of place that <unk> stuff up but is very nice about apologizing for it
4 ok , so i know phoenix is n't known for their pastys but this place is so freakin amazing i think it could put us on the pasty map !
4 i almost feel like i am cheating , but as someone who has been going to yc 's for 15 years , and has done her best to stay true to them as their veggies got limp , the floors got dirty , and the staff got <unk> , i
3 my first time here . i got a $ 20 coupon in the mail , so i figured eh , free meal . i went here with my boyfriend and we were instantly greeted with friendliness from the staff . we ate at the bar and our bartender , <unk>
3 went here for a friend 's bday and had a great time . they plugged in the lights outside as it got dark and it was so lovely . we ordered a few different salads and 3 different pizzas , along with a breaded <unk> ball paired with <unk> sauce
3 i went here for ladies night last night and was pretty happy . 50 % of all drinks and cute little $ 3 appetizers . i had french fries , a chicken salad slider and 2 glasses of sangria . bill was $ 14 . that 's pretty cheap ,
4 really like this bar . it 's very hipster , but that 's not necessarily a bad thing . just some information for those who think yelp is god . i love the setup of this place . nice little patio outside on both sides , <unk> bar area ,
0 scary , crazy busy at like midnight , horribly slow <unk> , rude staff , and this is literally where the `` people of walmart '' reside . ` nuff said .
4 i could go here any time , any day . i love this place and have been multiple times . many times while going to school at <unk> . they have quick service and hot food ! i love the jade red chicken . i do n't even like beans
3 tasty . had a frittata , freakin ' bomb . and cheap ! that 's my <unk> -lrb- style -rrb- . had some crazy <unk> drink that was off the hook !
3 my niece and i were having that conversation ... where do you want to eat ... i do n't know where do you want to eat when we drove past the rocket burger corner . i turned around to try it because of good yelp reviews and my curiosity regarding
2 we 've been going to mr. sushi for about 15 years and we have loved it and recommended it for all those years . however i 'm ready to move my sushi loyalty if i can find the right place . mr. sushi 's food is still great and the

4 a few of us from work went here for lunch one day . what a treat ! cornish pasty is a small little place , but the food is just the opposite . each of our dishes was more than we could eat in one sitting . i had the
4 i heard about this place after they started following me on twitter . curious by any restaurants i find online , i totally fell in love with their menu . i had to try it ! i went on a pretty slow weekend afternoon , and was surprised by how
0 <unk> minutes after our reservation we were seated . n o other expensive restaurant i have ever been in -lrb- nyc , europe , san <unk> -rrb- has ever treated us so <unk> . fish portions are half the size they used to be with higher prices . the waiters

4 mmmmmm , mmmmm , mmmmm ... never fails ... this place is unbelievable for breakfast and lunch -lrb- i have heard great things about dinner as well although i have yet to enjoy it -rrb- . i have only been for lunch twice , but both times were fantastic .
2 this place is a lot of fun . i know a lot of people complain about how the music is so loud and stuff but i think that 's what makes it feel like a night <unk> . i love going here with my girlfriends before we go out or

3 my local and favorite liquor store now has its own bar ! the beer and wine selection is constantly rotating to give patrons a sample and possibly some new options that they may have never tried before . in addition to the rotating taps and bottles , there are hundreds
3 this is my default happy <unk> in tempe . prices are good and food is better , but it can be expensive outside of happy hour . there is a wide selection of food and beverages on happy hour . really , you ca n't miss on this one .
4 what an amazing food adventure . i wish i had an additional stomach in order to be able to sample more of the amazing bites . the bad : so the space was a bit on the crowded side and there really not much room to maneuver around . layout
4 so i was taking a <unk> class for my profession on camelback and 16th street ... an area i have visited only a few times in the 25 years i 've lived in arizona -lrb- i am a blessed native phoenician -rrb- . i kept trying to find a place

3 i would say i love this place , but sometimes it 's just good and not great . but most of the time it is great , that that 's the reason for the four stars . whenever you want breakfast , this should be in your top three choices
4 there is <unk> cookie sandwich thing that is so good . the two outside `` cookies '' are made of different grains , but its the inside cream that is so good . the cookie is pretty sweet in general , but the tart creamy middle makes this very addictive
4 ryan was awesome . got me an italian red , french white , and german <unk> ! thx buddy !
4 oh my nom . this place is amazing . we go to talking stick a lot but it was n't until i read in the best of phoenix last year that this was voted `` best seafood '' that we even thought to check it out . i thought that
3 i loved this place when i went ! very old school <unk> feeling . the patio was awesome with a great view and i loved what i got . i ordered the salmon which was delicious and also ordered a pumpkin pie martini -lrb- it was around thanksgiving -rrb- and
4 delux burger medium rare -lrb- how they recommend it -rrb- ... mmmmm !!! such a good burger and get mixed fries so you can try their sweet potato ones as well . they come with great dipping sauces and in a little shopping cart which is cute and funny .
4 since i am a vegetarian , pita jungle is a great restaurant for me ! while i can get vegetarian plates at other restaurants , usually my options are pretty limited . here , i have tons of options . all of the pita jungles are kind of funky with
3 grapevine is a fun karaoke bar , and the only karaoke bar in old town as far as i know . i 've had a lot of fun nights here . it 's a great place to go for a birthday . it 's tiny inside though so you may
3 we started the night a lot here in college . i never order long islands anywhere else , but that 's the only thing i 've ever ordered here . they are huge , delicious , and $ 3 until 11pm . that is a deal . after one or

3 i am a sucker for a good dive bar , so i 'm pretty fond of this place . that being said , i rarely go inside of pranksters . <unk> about that patio . first of all , great view of the greenbelt and the sunset and stuff .
3 service is friendly but slow . i totally understand as packed at it was . <unk> offered service with a smile and even acted surprise at my boy 's excitement at having lost a tooth just before we were served . i brought my son in here to grab a
3 as far a movie theaters go , this one is just fine . the employees are always helpful and kind . its always clean , along with the restrooms . the popcorn is usually fresh ! for some reason this theater does n't get as packed as other theaters at
4 i am in freaking love with this place . why did n't i ever come here before the name change ? yep that 's right folks . that burger everyone loves so much was on the menu before the attic was the attic . anywho ... i came on a
4 my favourite thing is to walk into a restaurant with my child and have him be greated with smiles rather than dismay . handing a child a kids menu and letting them pick their own meal like the little person they are and giving them something to entertain them until
3 i love carly 's . it 's got that lived in feel . lots of rad faces every time you step in . great eats , wonderful brew selection . usually <unk> live jams . what could be better ? oh and the staff is so hospitable . the food

3 very nice little japanese restaurant . we 've been once for lunch and once for dinner . i love the fact that they cut a thick slab of fish for the sushi and sashimi here , much more so than other japanese places i 've been in arizona . this
2 i wanted to love this place but i 'm going to have to give it three stars only . the market itself is superb , with pretty much every possible ingredient , an outstanding <unk> selling every part of the lamb -lrb- and whole lambs -rrb- , industrial sized blocks
3 we heard they were having a special on `` boat noodles '' for five dollars a bowl so we stopped in to try them . they were absolutely perfect . we had the beef noodles , with generous chunks of beef and beef meatballs in a dark rich broth .
3 this is a review of the bar only . we stopped by for a cocktail on a saturday night . drinks are outrageously expensive - $ 15 for a mojito ? give me a freakin ' break ! however , the high <unk> is somewhat <unk> by the fact that
3 stopped by for a happy hour drink the other night . when we walked in at 5:15 , we were the only ones there . within half an hour it had filled up <unk> . first of all , it 's a very <unk> space , all dark wood and
3 the lee lee market shopping center in chandler is really one stop shopping for great food . we were already big fans of phoenix palace for dim sum and china magic noodle for noodles , so we thought we 'd try pho van . we both ordered the special pho
2 i agree that the decor makes you feel like you 're not in arizona . it made me feel like i was in new york . in 1988 . the only thing missing were some keith <unk> posters . it 's got a kind of -lrb- dated -rrb- <unk> 's
3 excellent . i love having breakfast out and this place is exactly what a breakfast place should be as far as i 'm concerned . quick , friendly and no-nonsense service . we both had omelets and they were big , hot and delicious . toast was perfect , as
1 wow , a lot of rave reviews here . somehow i think that company management has slipped us all a mickey ... perhaps uncle mickey , because he and aunt <unk> and all the kids are posting here . that 's because i ca n't find any of this stuff
1 i wanted to like this place , i really did . it 's kinda euro cool and feels like it might be really unique . i love the old tempe style tall brick walls and the clean interior design . we were greeted with a friendly smile and a ``
1 we love st. francis . we 're regulars there , and when we heard about the new place , we went to give it a try . we liked the vibe and the location is fine for us -- we 're about five minutes away . should be a popular
4 i love this restaurant -lrb- even though it 's a chain and i can hear my brother saying it 's just a `` glorified red lobster '' -rrb- . i ordered the crab and lobster bisque soup and am drooling thinking about how much i wish i could eat it
1 i recently went here for lunch and ordered a chicken caesar salad . i was amazed with how they managed to fit what seemed like an entire chicken in the small bread bowl , with about 10 small pieces of lettuce . if you like cubed chicken and at least
2 i went here last week for lunch since a colleague recommended it . i work near country club and the north 202 and am getting tired of the same old places within a 1-3 mile radius from work - so i was excited to try something new . typically when
3 great spot , but it get 's wayyyy too packed ! sort of a double edged sword , if it were n't always so packed it probably would n't be such a hotspot , but being so packed makes me decide to not go there about 60 % of the
3 the vig is a happening place it seems ... the outdoor back patio rocks , i mean it almost makes me regret <unk> smoking because that place is a dream for a smoker lol ... good drinks ... here 's how i know this , i order a greyhound -lrb-
2 i love ddd and always check out his picks when in the area . seen this on tv and decided to see what all the <unk> was all about . normally guy is pretty good with his choices but sometimes he can be off a bit . inside is rather
2 interesting . i have been wanting to try this place out for quite awhile . it is located in a older shopping center that is missing the main grocery store . easy to drive right past . inside is a no frills situation but casual . there are colorful pictures
2 we go there for lunch a lot on the weekends . close to the house . love the calamari with the special dipping sauce . the club sandwich with taro chips is yummy and can be split between two people . other things we like are the chopped salad ,
3 on my pizza radar . location is convenient . inside is a little small but will seat a lot of people with optional outside seating as well . gets busy really quick . service adequate . lighting inside can be a little dim and hard to see the presentation .
2 right inside the mekong plaza as you walk in the main entrance . place is very simple inside with really fast service although they both lack some charm . menu is rather large and is set up with a number system . they easily have over a hundred different choices
2 as others say ... i had to order the giant man vs. food del rey torta . just like the pictures already taken ... this thing is humongous ! i ca n't believe i ate the whole thing . the wife got the <unk> de res torta which was also
2 looks like this place was an old 7-11 at one time . the front has been redone and the inside is simply redecorated . it is more like a small convenience store with the scent of a french bakery in the air . they basically have some tables to eat
2 the burger i ordered was extremely delicious . very tender , great flavor , and the bun was great too . the dining experience in general however was poor , unorganized , and soooooo <unk> . the servers did n't know who was handling our table , we had to
2 i 've tried this place a couple times , and in general the food is really good . their lunch special ac n't be beat , but their service is n't always consistent . whether to go or dining in , i 've had several instances of slow service and
2 i enjoy coming here for a couple of drinks . the best time for me is right before it starts to get really busy at night . they have some good drink specials and the bartenders are pretty friendly before they get really busy . usually , this type of
4 ahhhhh , good ol' flo 's chinese restaurant . i love this place . i was introduced to this place when i first moved to az seven years ago by my friend <unk> . this quickly became my favorite happy hour place when i lived in the area . just
4 this is a great place to start the night . it 's a very casual and low key place to hang out . you can go outside and play corn hole or hang inside and play some pool in the back room . they play good music and i like
2 a good sports bar . slightly above average in food , drink , prices and atmosphere . not a place a go out of my way for , but always willing to go if that is where we end up .
3 awesome irish pub . great pub food and pub atmosphere . very reasonable prices .
3 awesome sandwiches !!!! good healthy variety .
4 the bf and i went last weekend for the first time after hearing great things about it -lrb- and after buying a 2 for 1 groupon a while back -rrb- . we were not disappointed . my only regret is that we could n't stay longer because there is so
3 tried this place today after buying a deal chicken certificate . we sat on the patio which is just fabulous ! lots of shade , misters that you can actually feel , and comfortable chairs . i had some drink with `` skinny '' in the name ... tequila ,
3 this place is exactly what they claim to be ... vegan comfort food . went with my mom who was visiting from out of town . the big <unk> tasted just like a big mac ... and the thyme fries were thin and crispy and perfect ! the tahini coleslaw
3 my favorite thing about this place is their happy hour ! $ 3.95 food specials and now $ 5 drink specials -lrb- that 's new it think -rrb- ! ca n't beat that . the bar area does get very busy , and it 's not that big , so
2 i bought a localdines certificate after reading all the positive reviews , but in the end it was n't as good as i was expecting . there was nothing wrong with it , it just seemed like standard mexican food . if you tell them it 's your first time
4 great fish tacos , love the atmosphere .
4 love it here , always will .
2 expensive and snobby .
4 shakes are crazy delicious .
4 miss this place and the great drinks . love the hip hop here .
4 great lunch spot , really yummy sandwich and very <unk> .
4 i take my little brother here every year for his birthday . so cute and such a great atmosphere ! i do n't drink soda , but here its a treat so i indulge . : -rrb- i have to say my favorite thing is the <unk> salad . .
4 love it here . highly recommend and ca n't wait to go back . they do a lot of cute things , and the food is good .
4 great sandwiches , fun place to hang out , cool people , lots of little events , everyone should go here .
4 love the tea here . i come quite often and suggest others do the same . : -rrb-
3 nice place to have a bite to eat and watch a game on the multitude of tv screens . due to the scantily clad female servers , not a place to bring kids , and i would n't choose it as a date location -lrb- although my wife is not
3 this spot has several different venues under one roof . there is country bar with line dancing , a current dance club , a 70 's / 80 's dance club , a <unk> bar and a pool hall . the place is huge , with good drink specials .
3 have to agree with <unk> ... located just off the 51 , it does have a roadhouse feel to it ... have n't been there for dinner , but the combination <unk> -lrb- hence the name -rrb- cuisine is pretty good fare ...
3 one of the better shopping areas in phoenix . a lot of shops , with several different areas . plenty of stores , and the central area has quite a few good eateries , and well as a couple of dance places . nice atmosphere , with outdoor concerts at
2 this is a very average to above average sushi restaurant . the bar is nice , seating is limited -lrb- like most sushi places -rrb- . the sushi is good , but completely unremarkable . on par with ra , but not in the same league as sakana . i
4 for a chain restaurant , this is one of , if not the best . grew up going to the original in nyc , so i may be biased , but i have never not had a good meal here . whether you sit down at one of the hibachi
4 so far , the best seafood restaurant we 've been to in phoenix . everything was excellent , from the menu , to the food quality and presentation , to the service . definitely a place to take someone to impress . i 've been there a half dozen times
3 above average steak house . both this one and the one on camelback . enjoyed the steak . not my favorite in phoenix , but i would definitely go back there .
1 the service was good but the food was awful . the nachos were terrible . the bun was extremely soggy on the chicken burger . the cajun chicken on the chicken caesar salad was essentially chicken covered in an extreme amount of raw spices that were n't cooked onto the
1 i was n't impressed by hana . our service was extremely slow , we were about to give up and leave because our waitress took so long to take our order . we ordered ebi tempura and <unk> sake <unk> as appetizers . the tempura was a bit bland .
4 we have driven past here many times and finally decided to try it . amazing ! the food tastes just like my in-laws family makes . perfect beans and rice , the red chili beef and spinach <unk> were on point ! this will become our new go-to spot !
4 i love <unk> ! the waffle was a bit like an <unk> waffle , i wish it was thicker ... awesome place .
4 gave this place another shot and loved it ! fish tacos and mexican hot dog were delicious !
2 we went to richardson 's for a date night . we were told they do n't take reservations for parties less than 4 people . when we arrived , the wait was an hour . we chose to wait because we did n't want to sit at the bar ,
1 as some of the other reviewers , i waited until i had given this locally owned place a few chances ... 2 times for breakfast and once for an early dinner . i have to say i did enjoy the breakfasts -lrb- pancakes once and farmers omelet the second -rrb-
3 if you are over in the west valley and want to stay away from the cardinals stadium and all that craziness , just up the freeway a couple <unk> is a row of <unk> right off the northern exit . easy access and lots of parking . to be honest
2 our second venture out in restaurant week brought us to tqla . it is a large restaurant -lrb- maybe it was something else before tqla ? -rrb- not sure . anyway , it is hard to miss , very prominent on val vista in front of the shopping center .
1 i have now been here twice and both times i found the food to be just ok and the service to be not so ok . both times i went through the drive thru and both times the person waiting on me was less than helpful . when i got
3 met a friend for an early dinner here on a tuesday night . very small place , but there were plenty of tables available . the wait staff is really friendly and knowledgeable . i had the delicious lasagna and my friend had the italian stallion -lrb- all meat and
4 pappadeaux is definitely my favorite restaurant . the food is to die for ! cajun deliciousness and fresh seafood ! who could resist ? things to definitely try : oyster & shrimp fondue mediterranean calamari shrimp <unk> pasta mardi gras crawfish bisque mussels blackened <unk> desserts ? where do i
4 sorry matthew k. - it 's official - the place now reeks of fish . i 've however , never had an aversion to pungent seafood aromas , so it 's all good with me . i 've always had a thing for grocery stores , the aisles and aisles
3 every time i go to a place like bomberos i tend to guess what it 's reminiscent of . is it south beach ? new york ? la ? and i caught myself doing the same thing sitting on bomberos patio when i decided it belongs to phoenix , pure
2 i came in on a work night to give a pho place in glendale a chance . the place is located in downtown glendale ; which sadly is a neglected part of town which makes the worst of phoenix look pristine ... an <unk> restaurant like this is a positive
3 i returned to this place a couple of times , most recently was this week . somehow the coffee has n't tasted as good as the first time . what i really like about this place is that when i 'm near downtown phoenix on a week night , and
3 i came for the thai <unk> food which is heavily influenced by <unk> culture and not as much by the siamese which is the typical style of <unk> thai restaurants . the history is a different story . it 's about the <unk> food ; generally not supposed to be
2 my first time here , and for good reasons . i got my standard pho . i know , it 's not fair to judge a restaurant based on just one item . but pho is quintessential of any south vietnamese restaurant . the cook has to get this soup
2 this week , my friend and i decided to check out this place for our weekly brunch . it was ok . not awesome , but not bad , either . my friend had the <unk> -lrb- yes , <unk> -rrb- protein pancakes , and they were huge . some
1 although the atmosphere here is quaint with its live mariachi band , the guy with the rose bucket coming around , and the dim lighting , the food is just ... meh . i went here on the recommendation of a friend i was with and had brought some out-of-town
4 omg . this place is awesome ! at first , i was n't sure what i was getting into as i drove from tempe out to the <unk> suburb known as gilbert for dinner , but as soon as i saw the neon signage and gravel parking lot for joe
2 nice friendly staff , good food ! gets busy quickly . loved the meat sauce ! will definitely will stop again to try something different . this time i had the veal cutlet which was a veal patties and not `` real veal slices '' but it was good .
3 i first visited to this spot last night where i was able to sample food off the the happy hour menu . the place was packed they had music starting at 6 pm which was pretty good and service was very good and attentive . i also ordered the <unk>
4 i visited the deli for the first time yesterday for lunch . the service was amazing and attentive . the deli is family-owned and operated on our visit , we 've received <unk> visits from the chef/owner to ask if we enjoyed our meal . i had the cuban pork
4 i love coming here for an after work drink in a relaxing environment . they have a decent wine selection with a nice happy hour menu offering some really tasty treats . i love the bruschetta , particularly the brie , apple and caramelized onions - delicious ! the staff
4 i enjoy shopping consignment stores for the deeply <unk> -lrb- by my mother -rrb- need to find - and brag - about getting the absolute best deals imaginable . more importantly , i never seem to want to dress to the current fashion trends and regular retail locations never seem
1 i ca n't even begin to say how many poor customer service experiences i have had here . we used to do lunches a few times a week at my old job and zipps seemed to be one of the regular spots , although i always made a fuss .
3 went here for a work lunch -lrb- group of 9 -rrb- and the hostess and the waitresses were very accomodating -lrb- given our size and needing to move tables once due to our growing group -rrb- . they got all our orders correct and i was happy that they were
2 went here yesterday with my many nieces and nephews for our ` kid 's outing ' as we like to call them -lrb- basically means their parents get a day off from their kids and my sis and i get to <unk> them but on neutral turf : the mall
3 i enjoyed coming here ... very close to the library and i was still able to find a parking spot on the street . i enjoyed a nice hot latte -lrb- yes , i know , in the middle of summer ! -rrb- and one of their delicious homemade bread
2 my family and i have been coming to this place for years ... back when it was called ` crystal palace ' . we still go regularly , mostly for my dad 's or mom 's b-day celebration . . or with my in-laws . one thing i 've noticed
4 we 've celebrated a couple of romantic occasions at this venue and have had , both times , an outstanding experience . when you first walk in , there is an amazing tall wall of beautifully showcased wines - all kinds . the last time we were there , as
2 after having a great dinner nearby , we walked to filmbar for our movie . we arrived about 10min before the showing time and the place had a ridiculous glob of people in a disorganized line for the bar and there was no way of telling where to go for
3 this place was quite busy for being a friday afternoon . the young gal at the register was not only friendly , but helpful in picking out what to try . since i was having a procedure done later , i wanted to lay off the <unk> , so i
3 walked in and ordered the grilled vegetable salad with extra green veggies and the gal taking the order was friendly , prompt and my to-go container came out within 10min with a * crap * load of veggies - seriously awesome that they were not meager or stingy with those
3 i am a big fan of this place . i have been to it at least 6 times already and everything i 've had has been really enjoyable , inventive , and also served with <unk> staff . they seem to hire only nice , friendly , people which really
3 i 've been to this location numerous times . . one of the recent times i went , i had a groupon -lrb- yeah , i was pretty stoked about that -rrb- . we ran in to a big problem when , even after confirming it over the phone ,
3 my bff planned an awesome dinner here to start off the evening that was my bachelorette party . our party of 10 or so were seated smack in the middle -lrb- near the bull -rrb- at this huge round table and we had the most attentive waiting staff ever -lrb-
2 went for lunch with wifey on monday . all-in-all , it was ok . we opted for the 2 for $ 25 meal . we got two appetizers instead of one dessert . the ayce bread sticks and salad bowl is still basically the same and pretty good . but
2 had not been here for about six years , but decided to try dinner here again . cocktails are generous and very affordable . dinner prices are reasonable , but food is mediocre at best . imo , food quality and taste is not as good as before . i
3 just an update . my kids and their families all came for thanksgiving so on friday , i took them all here for dinner since most of them like this place . nothing significant to report on regarding changes , but there were a few changes that were noticed .
1 i was just there this morning . and again about two weeks ago . i think the food is still pretty good and they changed their stupid pricing policy about not being able to buy bbq at the deli and then sitting down and ordering some other dishes and eating
3 we went with friends again on friday night , <unk> . once again , the food was good and plentiful . pretty much the same things as they always have , but we especially like the deep friend , <unk> rock fish . we also like the kalbi and fried
1 trapped downtown on a sunday and not much open but this . i ate my meal which is about all i can say . staff is indifferent to whomever is in the building -lrb- and you will get all kinds ! -rrb- and the pizza and pasta are mediocre at
3 good food , attentive service , tasty drinks but you have to be ok with noise - it 's loud !
4 for years i <unk> under the <unk> that this was a fast food pita place . must 've been confused <unk> pit because when i finally tried the one in flagstaff , discovered they had an immensely attractive , healthy and varied menu and a full bar ! what more
3 i do n't usually review chain restaurants . i figure they can do without extra promotion , and i generally do n't care for the food at chains , but the keg surprised me . everything i had was very good , from the cosmo to start off the meal
3 i really enjoyed myself here tonight . i forgot to bring some <unk> , so my ears are still ringing from listening to the live band , but that 's okay . they sounded fantastic and were a lot of fun to listen to . i had the ranchero salad
3 yum , yum , yummy ! this place serves amazing mexican food . nothing fancy , just high-quality ingredients simply prepared so you can really taste their wonderful flavors . the vegetarian burrito is delicious . dip it into the yummy salsas , and eat the spicy carrots with fresh
2 in the office , fiesta burrito is aptly known as `` across the street . '' kind of like , `` how about across the street ? '' `` yeah , i could do across the street , today . '' if i ever said , `` how about fiesta
4 the buffalo serves wings , boneless wings , boneless wings sandwiches , and salads that can be ordered with or without wings . i like my wings with the bone , otherwise known as tradition wings . there are some twenty odd flavors . currently , i get half hot
4 while mesmerized by watching my dinner prepared some questions occurred to me . does this count as dinner theater ? how much sake can i consume ? is a beating heart of rice romantic ? will my wife be <unk> because her tofu is where the shrimp was on the
1 do n't go to pepin for the food , and i 'm not saying that because of a lack of spanish authenticity ; it just does n't taste good , ever ... usually . this time was n't bad and last time they did n't have my first three choices
4 p. f chang 's china bistro has grown on me over the years , and i just really like eating at p. f. chang 's . recently , i 've been ordering the dan dan noodles . i like it spicy . there are also a variety of options for
2 the baby of p. f. changs , pei wei offers pan asian fast food . the dishes offer more vegetables than the neighborhood chinese joints . you can make it as spicy as you want with the pan asian condiments of spicy mustard and spicy red sauce . our location
1 management or lack thereof have ruined this place - zero service and food has become completely mediocre . .
2 if you 're in the parking lot and starving go for it . otherwise not really worth a trip . not bad but just typical , average , mediocre . menu does have variety - but again you 've had it all before . wait staff - slightly below average
3 good pizza - crispy crust , tons of toppings , and some creative combinations . stopped in when stranded at the hospital across the street and would happily go back to this location or try the other locations .
3 i could eat the turkey subs here everyday if i could . one of the best subs i 've ever had ... and i eat them pretty frequently . the half sub is only 3.50 , which is pretty cheap in my book . this is family owned , so
2 i adore all of joe 's restaurants . that being said , i think this one is my least favorite . . -lrb- which means it 's still better than most of the restaurants i 've had the pleasure of dining at in the greater phoenix area . -rrb- i
3 i love the pollo fundido and <unk> burrito . super no frills , yummy mexican food . decent prices . clean and quick , lots of choices . go for 5 dollar fundido wednesdays !
2 small <unk> one complaint about this place is they do all their ordering on iphones ; so the delay in taking our order is the waitress <unk> with her phone and trying to get the system to work . can we just stick to pen and paper ?? seriously ,
2 if it had some more appealing stores , i would probably come here a lot more than i do . there are a lot of `` teen '' inspired stores in the center , which accounts for the roaming kids , even though it says children are n't allowed to
4 what a great concept !! i was able to make and confirm my appointment right on their website . . so handy and convenient . i tend to be angry every year around the time of my company xmas party ; i tend to just want a style , without
3 donuts , donuts , lots of donuts !! my brother in law kept raving about lamar 's , so we ducked in here on a sunday afternoon . the donuts are huge . now my experience of donuts , is pretty fantastic . i 'm a big lover of donuts
3 flamingo palace is the closest thing to east coast chinese food i 've found . the house chicken is super tasty and they have really yummy rice . yes it 's a little worn inside and that fish in the tank needs a bigger tank , but it 's well
1 i drove by this location and almost kept going . however once again i was in the mood for mexican food and decided to give this place a try . the restaurant itself is rather outdated , trip <unk> everywhere as you walk from one level to another to another
1 i had heard about this restaurant from some neighbors and certainly have passed by it many times . finally i decided to stop by for lunch during the weekend . i arrived after the lunch rush and the place was nice and tidy . the dcor , tables and booths
3 now this is the real deal of a local pizza joint with flavor . another review stated the calzone is not completely filled with stuffing at each corner , that is still true . . a lot of wasted space and i do n't care to eat simply cooked dough
2 always spot on with delicious burgers and shakes ; ca n't go wrong with this chain restaurant . however i am not a fan of <unk> floors where food crumbs , etc can gather . although other reviewers have much more negative feedback about this issue and bugs , i
2 good classic bar food and then some . $ 5 burgers every tuesday after 5pm . good cocktails . calamari good but portion looks deceiving as lettuce lays below calamari .
3 never had a bad meal here . good burgers nachos and beer . the place is always crowded . great for people watching .
3 nice location . good outdoor dining . moms pot roast good and so are sausage ravioli . interesting drinks an some local beers . i need to check out the bliss burger soon .
2 good burgers and more . kind of loud music , had to ask to turn down . plenty of burgers to choose from making you come back . tot nachos are good & satisfy your craving . ring of fire burger good if you like your burger w / a
2 good portions , fun place on a wide variety of food . good people watching .
4 the newest location is the best so far ! the design is so much more appealing and a better fit than the previous locations . and , super awesome that the store is connected to a new coffee spot .
4 always so so good ! it only took me six or seven years , but i finally ate there on a pasta night and it was just as awesome as i expected ! favorite place to eat for all occasions , and for any meal - especially brunch , which
1 a lot of the old wait staff has either moved on or been let go ... but , my most recent experience there was so lame that i doubt that i 'll return . more than the food , quality of service and hospitality are more important to me ,

3 pretty good pizza . i 've tried just about every pizza place around and this is in the top 5 .
2 i like warming up at shotgun betty 's . they play rock like guns and roses , ac dc and rage . interesting crowd of jesse james <unk> and rocker type motorcycle <unk> . good place to people watch . other than that nothing really outstanding to say about the
0 this review is based on their mini-golf and that alone . everything else looked pretty useless as well but the mini-golf was an absolute joke . they had 3 courses to choose from and all three were very poorly designed and run down like the place has been around for
2 cool cowboy campfire atmosphere with live music at the right times but i waited 2 hours for a hamburger . it was pretty tasty but stil . 2 hours ? it was pretty packed . i had fun . the end .
3 zipps is consistent . always tasty bar food , good drinks , <unk> and good games .
4 so i was totally worried that lolo 's would n't live up to the hype . everyone has been talking about it and it 's pretty trendy to go eat there , so my husband and i were excited but reserved about finally trying it . i have to say
4 i freaking love mojo yogurt . seriously . i go there with my daughter about once a week . she does n't even ask for ice cream anymore , she just asks if we can go to mojo yogurt , and who am i to deny anyone of love in
3 lee 's is one of the reasons i carry cash on hand . when my hubby and i first moved to chandler , we would drive by lee 's all the time and always comment on how we 'd love to try it because it 's so damn bright and
4 awesome salad bar with great selections . they have a nice computer feature if you 're getting the salad bar and paying with credit or debit . skip the long line and head to the kiosk on the right .
0 i like the new look but hate the confusing new set up . it 's all , `` i 'm a buffet , but nope no i 'm not ! '' ordered the 1/4 white chicken with mashed potatoes & bacon & onion mac & cheese . comes with complimentary
4 my daughter who once told me she loves whoever invented meat asks to go here , i think that pretty much says it all .
3 everytime i stop at the phx airport i make it a point to stop at the barrio cafe . they have exceptional margaritas especially there `` <unk> '' margarita . there food is also really good especially for airport food .
1 i really wanted to like this place since i really dig family owned businesses i guess i will start my review by saying i ordered via phone but when i called i got an automated system that was horrible and did n't route you to anyone instead it said to
4 hands down one of my favorite places to eat . beer selection is probably the best with over 100 beers on tap and there food is awesome . ive had there burgers which are awesome as well as there ny steak sandwich also there mac and cheese is to die
4 i enjoyed the chopped salad with salmon , couscous , cranberries & more on a fresh bed of arugula , yum ! the salmon was fresh and moist and the toppings were a nice mix . add to this the big fresh chunks of bread and this meal is fit
4 what can you possibly complain about other than it 's hard to eat healthy here because everything is laden with butter . everything we had was perfectly prepared and the desserts were amazing ! the service is always top notch and the setting is your typical white table <unk> <unk>
3 i love the fact that the clientel varies from business professionals to <unk> workers , obviously with a taste for good italian . the italian wedding soup was delicious . with sliced meatballs and a poached egg ... it 's a meal in itself . the complimentary pizza crust with
4 i ca n't believe the good fortune of getting a large pita jungle in our neighborhood , right next to the movies no less . good happy hour with a large selection of $ 1 tapas -lrb- small plates -rrb- . we had the hummus trio & the order of
1 i ca n't say i 'd bother going here again since there are much better options . my salad although good crisp lettuce had a processed chicken on top that was n't good and the spicy chile dressing they <unk> on , although i asked for dressing on the side
4 had our new year 's eve dinner experience here and enjoyed every bit of it ! steaks were melt in your mouth tender and perfectly prepared . we also got to try the bacon wrapped scallops that were prepared perfectly , also ... moist and tasty . you get to
4 the continental chicken sandwich is always top on my list if i do n't want a salad . still healthy , but does n't taste it ! it has this sweet sauce with a punch of horseradish combined with the caramelized onions ... its absolutely a winner in my book
4 love this place ! the name pretty much says enough for the whole review : blanco tacos and tequila ... what more do you need . okay , the food was yummy , and service was top-notch ! we had the guacamole -lrb- huge serving -rrb- and a cheese crisp
3 finally , got to go to joe 's . i waited in line for 30 minutes to place my order and then i waited in line to get my own drink . was the atmosphere and food worth it , yes . i knew going for lunch on sunday would
3 completely enjoyed a post thanksgiving meal here in the private room with our large group of 12 . everyone raved about the various steak dishes they ordered and the sides are delicious ! my barbecue salmon was a little fishy for my taste which means it 's not as fresh
3 breakfast , lunch and hoping to have dinner there soon too . lunch menu nails it , something for everyone ! they were out of the pork so i had the croque <unk> -lrb- sp ? -rrb- it was awesome ! i suggest having it for breakfast with the egg
0 seeking an <unk> and keeping the well established business open seems like a better alternative in my eye . giving up does n't seem fit .
4 delicious ! excellent menu variation . got ta love places that are open later !
3 was here the past week for a private event , got to say , not very many establishments have the feel olive & ivy has . the ambiance is priceless . what a great time of year to relax on the patio with a glass of wine and a flatbread
2 simple question . how can a restaurant with a menu as big as the cf do anything right ? do they do everything right , nothing right , or somewhere in between ? my experience has been that they 're somewhere in between . one thing for sure , they
2 had the new yorker sandwich and a bowl of matzo ball soup . sandwich good . fries ... good but needed seasoning . matzo ball soup ... meh . i think a chicken stood next to the pot when they were making the broth but chose not to get in
3 a few things ... - this place is located in one of the older , and more colorful , parts of chandler - when you find the place you 'll wonder if its the right place - parking can be a challenge ordered biscuits and gravy . not bad ...
2 food ... good -lrb- we had korean vice the sushi -rrb- . not great , but good . cinnamon tea was real good . i suspect if you were to drink a 16oz glass of the stuff you would n't sleep for a week . service was quick and efficient
2 food was ok . we ordered the pork chop and the burger . nothing special to rave about on either . the big sticking point was the time it took to arrive . given that the staff far out <unk> the customers in the place i still ca n't figure
3 never been here before most likely because i rarely get to this end of town . had a chicago dog and a couple of sliders . dog was good albeit the celery salt was a little salty for my tastes ... and i like salt . sliders were good ...
3 quite good actually . you just need to ask yourself if you 're prepared to drop $ 3 for a popsicle .
0 went last night for zoe <unk> concert . the sound was good and our coffees were pretty tasty -lrb- though overpriced -rrb- but with our $ 15 ticket , we did n't `` make a reservation '' so we were seated on the other side of the bar as far
4 this place has obviously <unk> on to me as i went a second day in a row . still kept it simple and got the cheeseburger combo with fries and a fountain drink since i 've <unk> my budget this week but i do n't plan on this being the
4 over a year later and still great . went in on a sunday afternoon for a late lunch and got the california burger -lrb- sans tomatoes and pickles -rrb- . the avocado was fresh , the bun was n't dry , and their `` secret '' sauce was still perfectly
2 i 've lived within walking distance for over a year and just had the chance to try it when i was treated to an early lunch last saturday via madre . two big , thin slices of a cheese pizza and an excellent cannoli for under $ 6 ca n't
4 never heard of this place before today but i wanted to go somewhere i 'd never been . i love breakfast foods so i knew that even if it was n't the best , i would enjoy it . it 's tucked out of sight , near the holiday inn
4 great service , awesome food . went here last night with a groupon and two friends . we sat at the bar and had rob -lrb- i hope i got your name right ! -rrb- the bartender serving us all night . he was really accomidating and friendly . we
4 super friendly staff and excellent food . got a plate of scrambled eggs with bacon , home fries and a slice of sourdough bread . the bacon was super thick and excellent quality with a distinct maple flavour . the eggs were also perfectly cooked and fluffy and the <unk>
2 got the florentine eggs benedict with tater tots and a side of the 1/2 portion brioche french toast . the tater tots had a different flavour , from whatever oil they were fried in . it was n't bad , but it was a bit weird since it was unexpected
1 pretty tasty , hearty burger with natural cut fries but , overall , nothing really special about this place . the inside looks just like in-n-out with signs covering the walls proclaiming all the positive reviews around the states it 's received - almost like they 're trying to pressure
1 i was a big fan of <unk> <unk> <unk> , the original restaurant that the building was built and housed for some years before its <unk> <unk> earlier this year . it was the most authentic irish restaurant i 've been to in arizona -lrb- see : * most *
3 recommended to me by my dad , so we went there together this morning . i got the california eggs benedict which is the usual benedict but with cooked spinach , avocado and tomato . i replaced the tomato with canadian bacon . it also came with a small side
3 went on this past wednesday evening for the first time . they have a small private lot but it was full when i got there at 4pm . there 's plenty of street parking around , both paid and free , so you might have to walk a few yards
1 it 's hard to review big fat greek when you 've had obviously better greek food in phoenix , but here goes . great service , they do put on a fantastic show when someone orders the `` flaming feta '' . their portions are copious , but the gyro
3 when i 'm in tempe , so far , there is only one place i need to go to , and that 's rula bula . i 'm a huge fan of their sister place , <unk> <unk> <unk> , and they basically have the same menu . i love
4 gyros are tough to rate . i am a firm believer that all gyro meat comes from one factory in the northeast . it really breaks down to what is served with them and how . these guys make them right . crispy , juicy , and overflowing out of
1 tried this place for lunch today , was n't really impressed , seeing the number of 5 's on here . the french fries are frozen , <unk> , and they do n't have much flavor . maybe i 'm spoiled by in n out 's real potatoes , but
4 how have i not reviewed this place on yelp ? i reviewed them for check please , arizona ! , a pbs review show . <unk> . i could at least do a written review . i 've eaten at fez so many times , i ca n't count anymore
1 everytime i go to majerle 's i leave wondering why i ever went in the 1st place . the service is bad most of the time , the bartenders have attitudes & the beer selection is sub par . i give it 2 stars instead of 1 because for some
4 perhaps the greatest little middle eastern market & restaurant in the valley ! the hummus & <unk> are to die for , the lamb is out of this world and the feta cheese may be the freshest i have ever experienced . my favorite med . cuisine location by far
3 what a neat little place ! imagine a deli style wine bar that does pretty much everything right . as i understand , this is a family affair an it shows . everything is done with care an attention to detail . the wine selection is nice , reasonably priced
3 great beer selection , tasty wing sauce , <unk> staff ! great bar area fast and friendly service !!!
1 this place is n't terrible but ... i 've had better . the outside is tacky and it was hard to find the entrance . the set up is just weird , its more of a bar than a sushi place . like a run down bar not a nice
1 this place is n't classy and has a ross in it for crying out loud !! but ... i am en love with <unk> 's of hollywood !!! you wo n't find a nordstrom in this mall .
1 this place has potential . the only complaint that i have is the live band that sings top 40s instead of a dj doing top 40s . it was weird and put a damper on my mood . this place is definitely for the older crowd ! i did n't
1 i finally checked it out and i think its my least favorite of the fox restaurants . its like the little <unk> of fancy pizza . i 'll actually take little <unk> next time since i can get more than double the food ... upon further reflection , it tastes
3 dim sum ! i was worried when i saw how small the dining area was , but it worked out perfectly since i was starving by the time we arrived . immediately we were asked what we wanted to drink -lrb- tea is <unk> ea -rrb- , and then all
2 cute little restaurant - dining room , bar and kitchen are in the basement . literally a cellar ! the seafood was good quality and solid . the mussels smelled a little weird - not sure if it was the broth it was cooked in or the accompanying sauces but
2 its a nice little coffee shop with free wifi . i 'm not a big coffee drinker , so i ca n't attest to the coffee , it was about the same for me . . i did n't like that they did n't have a lot of pastry choices
1 how do you mess up bulgogi ?? it tasted like they cooked it and then <unk> it in water . i asked the waitress to taste it and her response - `` tastes fine to me , i did n't get any complaints from any other customers '' . the
1 they have a lot of choices on the menu , but if they ca n't even wash the lettuce right for the lettuce wraps i <unk> to think what ends up in their burgers . all in all , mediocre food and not worth forming a <unk> of dirt in
3 got the combination plate , i 'm not very familiar with middle eastern food so i 'm not sure i 'm a good judge . the gyro meat was a little greasy . . i liked the thing that looked like egg roll and the thing that looked like hush
2 so i 've been there once before and wanted my friend to try it . i was expecting it but it was still a bit <unk> walking in through the kitchen area . then you 're in the gift shop - granted they 've got some very interesting things .
2 on the one hand , i do n't think this place deserves the 2.5 star rating it currently holds but on the other , i can understand the disappointment . . we got the box combo which is like 4 tenders , texas toast , cole slaw , fries and
2 this is another <unk> east meets west sushi place where they put all kinds of mayo concoctions and cream cheese into something that was supposed to be healthy . that being said , i thought the rolls were pretty creative and none all too bad . they did n't seem
0 this place is disgusting ! the place looks ok , the decor looks fine and everything looks good at the beginning . i ordered a carafe of green apple infused sake . both me and the friend i was with poured our first little shot when we realized the <unk>
2 so they now have a pizza kitchen area and another area that i do n't recognize on the other side of the room . the pizza 's a-ok , nothing that blows your mind - good crust , can be a little <unk> in the middle of the pie ,
2 pretty neat bar with cool atmosphere . live band on some nights . food is n't bad for a bar . i had the bbq chicken pizza - the dough was tasteless so i did n't eat the crust . the chicken was like jerky . but the overall flavor
2 this is a neat place with a lot of outdoor as well as indoor space . i like the volume of the music , the decor 's cool , and the beer selection is pretty good . however , they 're also one of the ones that serve the beer
2 i was surprised at the prices - you can get a sundae for 5 bucks ! nowadays it seems like a milkshake costs you that much . . the items seem very sweet however , i guess they do n't call it sugar bowl for nothing . i think i
3 very nice resort that reminds you of vegas a little bit . they have multiple restaurants , a buffet , bars , and a lounge . the restaurant/lounge upstairs has a great view -lrb- by the way , there 's a dress code to go up to the top floor
3 came here with my indian friend who said she would not be embarrassed to take me here for the food . so i thought that was a sign of good things to come . they have a buffet which was affordable -lrb- less than $ 10 -rrb- with great selection
4 i love this place . where else can you get a cheap -lrb- $ 3 - $ 4 -rrb- vietnamese sandwiches in arizona ? there are a bunch of chains in california , but this is the only one in az . . i usually get the combo or the
1 * review for dim sum only phoenix palace is part buffet , part a la carte dim sum , and part take-out chinese bbq . it 's huge ! the space could easily contain the <unk> , with a few smaller <unk> tucked away in reserve . i had dim
1 been back maybe a half dozen times since i wrote the review . gets worse every time -lrb- service , food , all of it -rrb- . dim sum <unk> is down at the gb !
3 the huge menu looks fantastic -lrb- crab , sea bass -rrb- but i 've only been for dim sum . selection is decent and it 's really good for phoenix -- try the steamed pork buns , har <unk> , and the bean curd <unk> things . weekdays are easier
4 a total place warp to new jersey or long island . the family could n't be nicer . terrific sandwiches -lrb- fresh mozzarella , tomato , basil and lots of others -rrb- , a nice selection of <unk> groceries , and it 's even fun to sit around outside at

3 great place to pickup thai for a night in . thumbs up to yellow curry chicken , shrimp pad thai , and spring rolls .
3 cocktails are where it 's at . happening bar and great quality food . servers have always been extremely friendly and knowledgeable . reminds me of back east a bit .
4 my go to place for sushi . 5 because the price is right . point break roll will rock your world . bartender is a really nice guy . ambience is old school and is a nice break from a lot of the sushi spots in old town .
3 elote -lrb- corn app . -rrb- is awesome here . ambience is colorful and fun .
4 the roast beef special today with caramelized onions and blue cheese was really tasty ! have you ever walked into a restaurant or retail establishment and just felt good about it ? i so want this place to succeed . something about the greeting , the friendly staff , the

3 the mini taco were good . the bartender -lrb- young lady with long dark hair -rrb- was very friendly and attentive . she had a great attitude and a big smile the entire time .
1 i 'm not clear why this place boasts `` you can experience the best food the whole world has to offer '' . the free chocolate covered strawberry was a nice touch but did n't make this the best restaurant . it was n't bad ... it just was n't
3 nick 's has portobello mushroom ravioli that can be served with their house pink sauce . it 's one of the best things i 've ever tasted .
2 noisy , but nice . i met a girlfriend here for a lunch so we could catch up . the restaurant is very noisy ; just one big room with an open kitchen . most of the tables are so close together , you can hear other people 's conversations
2 not much <unk> pa pa in this german restaurant . <unk> du <unk> . my dad was career military and our family was stationed in heidelberg , germany for several years , while i was a teenager . i was fortunate for many things , among them the ability to

2 i went to donovan 's to try the az restaurant week tasting menu with friends . although we had a reservation , it took them an additional 40 minutes to seat us . normally not a big deal , but the atmosphere at the bar is boring and pretentious .
4 the perfect spot for a lunch meeting - close to the city center but away from the hustle and bustle . the quiet outside patio is nice for a breath of fresh air before returning to the <unk> air of your office tower . the lunch menu is affordable and
3 very high-quality , fresh ingredients are used to create every dish . the tuna tataki is the star of the show here and should not missed ... i think it is best by far ! i would suggest <unk> clear of the lil <unk> ... it 's weird combination of

3 i think i 've found my regular brunch spot . great portions , amazing food and drinks . . the only bummer is there can sometimes be a wait so you may want to get their early . i recommend the strawberries and chocolate pancakes or the cream brulee waffles
3 i do n't normally eat chinese food . . but when i do , it 's usually panda express ... although i think i may drive out of my way to go here more often . the food was amazing ! we had the seafood chow fun and <unk> tofu

4 love that this is close to my house and that the wait was only 20 min . love both the verde and wiseguy pizza .
4 great food ! love the spicy salsa , the meatball soup and the enchiladas . i 'm a sucker for fluffy flavorful yet simple rice and i could n't get enough of their rice !
3 great little spot with wonderful fries and biscuit sandwiches . yummy !
3 uhm ... this is what asian stores smell like so docking points because your <unk> nerves ca n't handle what 's normal for most of the world is n't really fair imo . i actually thought lee lee was pretty clean - there are definitely worse around . privilege ,

2 i 've been spoiled with good viet food in san jose and <unk> . this place was just ok . of course , everything 's relative so maybe i 'll adjust after trying some other viet places around . ordered bo nuong la <unk> -lrb- beef wrapped in grape leaves
3 great for happy hour on a warm evening , but i do n't think i 'd be here for the regular menu . it 's more like <unk> than authentic mexican food . server was a really <unk> blonde that needed some extra brain power but she made for good
3 this place looks a bit shady from the outside , and maybe even from the inside . but the service is friendly , the food is good , and the price is reasonable . i ate the <unk> fish which had awesome flavor but was not spicy enough . chinese
4 large , clean , organized , stocked . they have samples in the grocery and the cashiers open more registers when busy , unlike walmart down the street . wish the target near my place was as good as this one . ps : there 's a yelper below who

3 do n't come here looking for anything specific or you 'll probably be disappointed because it 's a mess . you 've got to have patience and scour over the racks because things are usually scattered outside of their designated areas . yes , people here are crazy . just
4 i have gone back and tried the curry on multiple <unk> . the <unk> curry is the best i have ever had . the red curry when ordered spicy is flavorful and brings the heat . the thai fried rice is good too .
4 we had a delightful experience at richardson 's today . the chipotle ribs small plate was amazing . the chorizo stuffed pork chop and chimayo chicken were wonderful . the service at the table was warm , friendly and efficient . frankly the new mexican cuisine at richardson 's is

4 four stars for service <unk> by marketplace employee <unk> , who helped answer questions regarding my food issues -lrb- allergies -rrb- and info regarding breakfast/brunch , lunch , and dinner <unk> , and also provided gelato samples , including his favorite , guiness gelato ! mmm ... guiness gelato ...

2 having visited a few gelato spots recently , i have to say that i do n't favor angel sweet 's over gelato spot anymore . i 'd even say that i 'd rather have gelato at arlecchino than at as , which is a little <unk> as there are n't

3 <unk> stumbled onto chill while exploring the area before settling down for dinner -lrb- at lobby 's -rrb- . the clerk here was friendly and accommodating w / sample requests . after dinner , i came back and ordered a cup of three flavors : dark chocolate , chocolate sugar-free

3 when i first moved to arizona in the late 1990 's , the valley 's foodie community was even smaller , and there were fewer websites to help us discover new places . that was when the bamboo club was my little secret . i would take many dates up
3 it 's a pretty good quick service version of the valley 's best mediterranean restaurant . this pita jungle has a drastically reduced menu that is perfectly suited for fashion square 's food court . it 's also probably one of the healthiest food choices in the mall . i
2 nothing superb , but certainly nothing bland . z ` tejas is a quality tex-mex chain that rarely disappoints . it has that bar vibe , but certainly not the scottsdale vibe that most of the restaurants in fashion square seem to be going for . my girlfriend and i
3 a great collection of native american artifacts that kept my attention for a couple of hours . the museum looks very small from the outside , but it sure manages to open up and cram a lot into the space on both of its floors . i highly recommend checking
2 i guess this is the best mall option for people in the west valley . a lot of places around arrowhead also make it an attractive shopping and dining destination . pretty much all of the big box and anchor stores are in the <unk> area , although driving across
2 for those of you who are really into this self serve fro-yo fad , zen zen yogurt is probably your place . it 's as good , if not better , than most of the others i have tried . but to me , it suffers from the same problems
3 many people have recommended that i try eating at the keg , but the thought of yet another upscale chain steakhouse was kind of a <unk> . the food is usually great at places like this , but the lack of uniqueness is a bit a of put off .
3 if you have n't shopped at a fresh and easy , the simple way to describe the store is it 's like trader joe 's . only fresh and easy has a modern feel to it instead of the hippie co-op atmosphere . for being a relatively small store ,
2 i 've been working out at la fitness for a few months now . not too many complaints . the gym is a good size . it does feel like it could use a few more machines and benches . when you go at a busy time it 's a
1 downtown phoenix bar . old town scottsdale prices . i guess that 's gypsy bar 's way of making up for not charging a cover but still <unk> parking . it 's half dance club , half arcade . there 's hot girls dancing on little stages and people randomly
4 four peaks is the perfect microbrewery ! i 've never had a beer from this place that i did n't like , and the food is top notch . plus , no matter what night you hit up four peaks there 's always a decent and fun crowd around you
3 i 'd bet on the vig . -lrb- for those who do n't know ; a vig is the amount a <unk> takes when you win a bet . do n't ask why i know this -rrb- . while it may just appear to be another trendy gastropub in arcadia
3 if you 're expecting great things from fashion square , i hate to break it to you , but it 's a mall . plain and simple . considering the massive indoor mall is pretty much a <unk> part of our culture , fashion square is wonderful for what it
4 is pizzeria bianco really the greatest pizza i 've ever had ? i 'm not quite ready to go that far . but does pizzeria bianco serve up incredible pizza that lives up to its hype ? oh , dear god , yes it does . we had the margherita
4 if there ever were a restaurant in the valley that made me think that i had died and gone to foodie heaven , it 's elements . not only is the food top notch , but the entire ambiance , inside and out , is fantastic . who 'd have
3 i 'm not really a big donut guy . but some fried breakfast sounded pretty good this morning . plus , i work on sunday mornings , and it always makes coworkers happy when somebody brings in junk food . so i picked up a dozen on my way to
2 cold beers . good . cheeseburgers . good . a bar that takes the simple concept of boasting that it has both of these . good , but not great . wanting to try cold beers & cheeseburgers for a while , and having a $ 30 for $ 15
4 chompie 's is the best new york deli in the valley . then again , there really is n't very much great competition . but it 's still great food . the menu is filled with the classics that you 'd expect to find in any new york deli .
4 i can still remember being at asu more than a decade ago , and laughing late at night every time i saw a commercial for flo 's . no matter what i was watching , somewhere between midnight and 3:00 am it would air at least once . a cheap
3 this is the perfect spot for a date night . for about the same price as seeing a movie in regular theaters , you can check out a <unk> in a very cozy setting . it kind of feels like you 're watching a movie in a very nice theater
3 i love the apple store . great products . great customer service . and just an overall cool presentation . i bought just bought my first mac here . great experience . it was like buying a car without the <unk> . i was shown how to set it up
3 rice paper 's menu made it tricky to pick what i wanted to eat . i used my usual `` <unk> ! '' method and went with two types of spring rolls . -lrb- of which , they have over 10 different types . the waiter mentioned that rice paper
3 the staff is incredibly friendly and helpful - almost to the point of being <unk> . it seems like the vietnamese places i go to are either extremely helpful or extremely <unk> to their customers ! i guess i 'd prefer the former . the food was great ! i
3 you know what ? i was way too harsh on zoe 's in my previous review . i 've caught myself eating at zoe 's much more often these days , and i can always count on a delicious meal . that deserves more than three stars . i especially
3 i really like fresh and easy . i 've actually come to dread any time i need to go into a safeway , basha 's , or fry 's . they 're too big ! i live alone , i spend most evenings cooking my own meals , and i
3 my family and i might have been lucky when we attended a recent coyotes game at the jobing.com arena . we did n't pay for parking . i thought that that was a bit unheard of at sporting events , but i did n't complain ! the complex itself is
4 every time i come here , i always think , `` okay , i 'll try something different this time . '' i do n't . i always get the vegetable <unk> . oh goodness , the eggplant is so tender , it just melts in my mouth . and
4 everyone always wants to call <unk> dive bar the greatest dive bar . but my vote wins -lrb- for reasons known only to me -rrb- . bikini lounge is truly the greatest dive i 've ever been to . pool table ? check . cash only ? check . filthy
3 great little `` greasy spoon '' breakfast diner . usually packed if you get there to late in the morning though , especially weekends . great omelettes and super service !
3 good authentic thai food . their menu is n't as extensive as thai elephant , but their prices are cheaper , and they are much closer to my house ! great place to grab some takeout , or bring a friend and eat in . good spring rolls , and
3 rip <unk> 's , just as well , big earl 's is much better ... they have some fantastic happy hour specials . my favorite so far : $ 5 crawfish boil on fridays . it is about 1 lb of mud bugs , which is an excellent snack .
4 here is my -lrb- probably not unique -rrb- take on pizzeria bianco : do n't come here on a budget , order away , and leave satisfied . do n't expect to walk right in , unless you plan ahead -lrb- get there at 4pm -rrb- , * and *
3 pretty darn good coffee and very tasty <unk> . stopped in for a meeting with a coworker over lunch and had a large cup of coffee in a mug and a <unk> wrap . i think i got out of there for around $ 6 , not too shabby .
2 i ca n't complain too much about us airways . they are a hometown airline , but i have been on a few that seem to be held together with <unk> tape . on a trip to europe a few years ago the bathroom was held together with the stuff
3 went to breadfruit a few weeks ago and it was delicious ! they have a few vegetarian options that are quite good . i 'll need to return to update this review , but believe me -lrb- please ! -rrb- , you will like this <unk> restaurant with big food
1 heavy sauce , mediocre shrimp , good and friendly service . do not think i will go back after two other friends said that they felt as bad as i did after eating there . the only reason it has two stars is due to the excellent service .
4 i drive by this car wash almost everyday to and from work and thought , `` hey , i should go check that cool looking place out . '' i am glad that i did and at $ 14 a month i get to wash my car as often as
1 nasty pizza and good service do not equal 5 stars .
3 nice little wine bar . i enjoyed a flight of whites and one of their specialty salads for lunch . pretty tasty . the food wo n't win any culinary rewards , but it is good and the ingredients seem fresh . minor <unk> , they only seem to have
1 in this spot , i <unk> the world <unk> cobb salad and a watered down arnold palmer . my accompanying bread roll was hard enough to break a tooth , so i could not partake . at least the prices were not outrageous .
3 very happy that this market opened . it is much more convenient than the grocery store : quick <unk> , easy to navigate , never crowded . great option when you are looking for a fast and healthy dinner . i would n't recommend for bulk or full scale grocery
2 cooperstown is a typical sports bar . and it has pretty much what you would expect : greasy -lrb- but yummy -rrb- food , decent beer selection , and plenty of televisions . however , all the screens upstairs were turned off when i went . the goofy staff ``
4 yummy ! big portions , low prices ... and food that does n't make you feel guilty after eating it . love the outdoor atmosphere too . this is a nice place to bring friends after a hike , or just enjoy a casual meal during your day .
3 great food , but somewhat pricey and trendy -lrb- read : busy -rrb- . although i love the garden <unk> caters to a certain type of clientele . this is the type of place you see wedding parties or find a ladies bridge club ... i would not recommend for
4 ca n't believe i have n't reviewed this place yet . i love this spot ! the food is great , the dining vibe is perfect -lrb- think cozy wine cellar -rrb- and all the staff are friendly . i mostly have visited for lunch , so prices are decent
3 i love this joint . been going there for years and a bit more frequently as of late . $ 7 cover , cheap drinks and have never seen a bad show . the mrs. and i like to go there after dinner out as the shows do n't start
3 good venue . we saw squeeze last night -lrb- great show -rrb- and were really happy at how intimate the place was . you 're never more than about 60 feet from the band , even when you 're in the bathroom . it also helped that it was pretty
3 i hit joeys on happy valley about once a month . get the dog with the onions , peppers , poppy seed bun and chase it down with some fries and a soda ... really hits the spot . i like to sit where i can look at the west
2 from the outside looking in this place looks like its very fancy . when you enter you walk right into the bar and a cluster of people . to get to the host to seat you , you have to elbow your way thru the crowd of people to get
2 good but a little pricy for the rolls . the special rolls are good but they are $ 14 - $ 16 so happy hour is a good time to go . there happy hour is 4-6 :30 mon - fri. . the $ 14 rolls are $ 9 .
0 well we wont be back again . this place could be so cool but i do n't really care for the menu and we have been unhappy with the food the last two times we have been and this last waitress sealed the deal for me . the waitress we
3 this place is great . they have a great selection of <unk> , oils , wine by the bottle or glass , chocolates , sauces , drinks , coffee bar , and fresh made to order pizzas and <unk> . its about half the size of trader joes , but
3 dam i wish i would have known this place was here sooner . really good sandwiches . they use boars head meat which i am a huge fan of . they have so many different sandwiches it took me a while to figure out what i wanted . the menu
3 i was very surprised with the prices . this place is good and the sushi is cheap . the waitress we had gave us what she called the underground sushi menu . these are creative and all sounded good but we had the april roll . tempura shrimp . real

0 first off what i can say is , never come here . horrible service , rude staff and uncooked food ! i was excited to go to this place but when i walked in i definitely did regret coming here . i went on a friday night and it was

2 sure , the food at olive & ivy is good , but there are <unk> of places , even fox rc places , that i have been to that are better . whenever i go to olive & ivy , i feel that the service is a little snooty ,
1 2.5 stars . i 've been to j. alexanders on two separate occasions , and each time , i was not impressed . their menu is significantly overpriced , and their quality to price ratio is pretty bad . i ordered the ahi tuna for dinner and the chips and
1 just like yelp says , i have experienced better . i came here late night with a friend after getting our ears pierced . was n't completely empty , but the staff had already begun closing up shop for the night . we were seated immediately . the waiter pretty

0 it 's a dive bar redone in wood . big deal . cute , maybe . the service is horrible . the alcohol selection stinks . bartenders with major attitude . god forbid they have to walk out from behind the bar before a server gets there . i guess
4 i try and eat here at least once every couple of weeks . i love the melon <unk> which i add the jasmine rice in it . the beef salad is awesome ! my daughter loves to eat here . the food is very fresh . the service is great

4 so glad i found this place . the pho ga is awesome , simple chicken soup with rice noodles . also love the 27 - seafood and chicken chow <unk> but with skinny slightly crispy egg noodles . also tried the fried beef with peppers and green onion over rice
3 came to this place because of triple <unk> . we got the bolognese ragu pasta , alfredo pasta with chicken , ravioli , and gorgonzola with sage and walnuts . all were very good . pasta were very thick , making the dishes heavy . everyone was very nice and

3 this place is surely a blast from the past . with the prices it 's definitely a restaurant fit for the high school students located just a short walk down the street . i wish there was a place like this near my high school back in my days .
4 this cute little restaurant definitely has some bragging rights . even in scottsdale where the restaurant competition is fierce . you name the type of food , scottsdale has several places fighting for those customers <unk> . with that said i feel that this place wo n't fail like so
3 on bell road in nw <unk> you will find several places to enjoy sushi . this place is near the top when you consider quality , value , and overall experience out of all the choices you have to chose from . located in a completely renovated strip mall <unk>

4 my kitchen , my country , my oh my what a great little <unk> restaurant this is . amidst a dying strip mall area on bell rd in northwest phoenix you 'll find an authentic <unk> place that has food that will make you want to go back for more
4 i have to say of all the thai restaurants that i have ever been to , and there has been a lot . this is my absolute favorite . every time i walk in here the smell is amazing . for years we have come here , ever since it

0 ok i will start with the good parts of this place . the hostess was sweet . she even helped us with the validation of the parking . the lettuce wraps were good . that is where it ends . i can honestly say , we will never come here
4 we have come here a few times in the past year , and we really liked it a lot ! so we decided to come here for our end of the world dinner . of course the world did not end because , i am writing this review , but
2 i have been here several times since they first opened . i have never been overly impressed . but , this time was really bad . i went early in the day at the beginning of the lunch , so they were not too busy . food was so so
4 wow , i came here with my friend for lunch on saturday . i can hardly wait to go back . all dishes are under 475 calories . i wish i could eat here everyday . the decor is very nice , dark wood and smells wonderful in there .
2 pros : dog friendly patio . separate non-smoking and smoking patios . overlooks greenbelt . cons : no happy hour food specials <unk> all apps are $ 9 - $ 11 -lrb- wings are $ 11 !!! -rrb- . maybe that 's why it 's dead inside and out on
0 i am shocked at how bad the tvs are !!! <unk> <unk> ? small and few tvs !!! several <unk> <unk> in them . only 1 big tv behind the bar and two 20 `` ers ??????? i simply can not believe the owner of this place has been so
3 bartender steven was pretty rude . heather was better . but service is pretty spotty . the ceviche was great , and for $ 9 is one of the better values . the huge side of roasted beets for $ 5 was also great . the carrots - not so
4 this place is excellent in every respect ! amazing seating options including a fantastic patio with an outdoor bar w tvs , nice <unk> chairs on grass , heaters , a <unk> set-up , heaters and fans ! inside the bar is great , the bathrooms are really nice .
0 horrid bar layout . <unk> block the view of the -lrb- only -rrb- 3 tvs at the bar . wow .
0 no wifi <unk> shame . 25 min wait for takeout or dine in -- at 1:15 on a sat ?! they need more staff . food has gone <unk> here . very inconsistent . used to be a consistent winner but now we 've had several mediocre to inedible dishes
3 this place is really cool , especially if you sit at the `` pizza bar . '' great atmosphere , fun watching <unk> and the assembly . the beet salad is good but over-priced for $ 10 . the potato pizza was just ok , would order something else .
3 i like this place . by far the best deal is the hot dog -lrb- phoenix or carolina style -rrb- for $ 6 which comes on the same huge pretzel bun as the burger and comes with excellent truffle fries . the wedge -lrb- $ 6 -rrb- is very small
1 i ca n't believe their half price kirin bombers are $ 6 on hh !! also , surly bartenders and short drink pours . maybe that 's why it 's dead on happy hour on friday ! it 's also too bad they do n't list `` half price ''
3 had the veggie tacos -lrb- grilled portobello -rrb- two ways . very tasty .
4 google for the `` secret '' -lrb- off-menu -rrb- styles of ordering your burger . animal <unk> style , etc. . great service , well run place .

3 good bbq i personally like meat serve without sauce , and this is exactly what they do , together with soft moist meat it is great place for quick lunch -lrb- except lines -rrb- but its actually best advertisement
4 the decor was amazing and the service was fantastic . the food was absolutely immaculate . the lamb dish was to die for and the chicken was very succulent and had nice sauces . the wild sea bass was cooked to perfection ! the appetizers and salads are also very

3 a little more than we wanted to spend on coffee and breakfast burritos , but very good . we will visit again .
3 this is the kind of fun and funky place that you just want to like . tiny , so going at unusual times -lrb- like later at night -rrb- is a bonus to get a seat . they seem to be known for their fish tacos , but that 's

0 any place that does not allow <unk> -lrb- like caps or hats -rrb- in my mind is <unk> out people who have to wear that for whatever reason like religion or for covering up some <unk> . i <unk> several friends that fall under this category . if they are
0 this bar is based more on looks rather than authenticity of sushi . not that i have a problem with promoting ambiance , but i 'm more about authenticity and dive places . additionally the service was rather <unk> and imho rather racist . there was definitely a <unk> difference
3 my wife and i came here for lunch . this is a great place if you want to eat healthy . it is located in the town & country shopping center . i have n't been to the town & country shopping center in 15 <unk> years . we were

1 the two stars are for the times that i found something incredible at an incredible price . this place is pretty dumpy and always very crowded . it is pretty far out of my way , so i am usually disappointed when i come home empty handed . personally ,
4 great mix of vintage , and new <unk> items with a rockabilly meets tiki meets <unk> flair . a great place to pick up gifts for the hard to please , a unique <unk> for your ikea dominated home , not to mention some funky clothing . their inventory continuously

3 cheap drinks . . make that cheap strong drinks , christmas lights coming out the <unk> , live music , quick and speedy bartenders , indoor/outdoor kick it area and a nice blended crowd . this time of year you can not tell what a true dive bar this is
4 sexy , cool , trendy , artsy but upscale vibe as you walk thru the doors . delicious , creative , mouth watering decisions as you scan the menu . beer , wine , bubbles and mixed drinks while you wait for your first plate in anticipation . relaxing cool

2 this place was okay , going to give it another chance to really decide . atmosphere is pretty cool , you feel comfortable soon as you walk in . . seat yourself place . after we placed our orders one of the two pastys we ordered had ran out which
4 absolutely wonderfully <unk> !!! dilly 's deli has a very large variety in the ingredients they offer which of course led me to taking forever to put together my order -lrb- but i was creating a masterpiece here -rrb- but after i finally got it together it was freaking delicious
4 great pizza ! light but filling , super fresh homemade ingredients that you can taste and just delicious ! it does get busy but we were able to snag a table around 1pm so some of the lunch crowd was starting to die down . they are very fast here
3 why total wine is better than bevmo : 1 -rrb- bevmo does not like you to get joy from being able to pick from rows and rows of single beers so you can build your own special pack 2 -rrb- organization 3 -rrb- about every beer you can buy in
2 i had a far better experience eating here the other day than my first visit a couple of years ago ... this place is pretty small , maybe about ten tables that can seat 4-6 people but i did n't feel cramped at all so that was cool . be
2 spaghetti is one of my faves so i was super excited to try this place out ... looks like i 'll have to save some of that excitement for another place . the interior looked pretty awesome and the people were nice enough . i ordered the garlic mizithra and

3 seriously , you might be a little weary coming here but for the love of all things good just go inside and try it ! if you can find somewhere to park that is . you can definitely tell the crowd here is diverse and there are some regular patrons
3 i really like this place . the food is really good , the wine is really well priced , the beer list is interesting enough for beer lovers or <unk> and the patio is great for dining with children . i like the new location as parking is much easier
3 great italian food , great price . that 's really all you need . wine selection is okay but they have something that will pair well with what you are eating no doubt . they have great specials and great happy hour . i have even taken my kid for
2 great drinks , great atmosphere - food 's good . i gave it a 3 out of 5 because i would n't necessarily go out of my way to be there but it 's a great place to be once you are there .
2 great little find ! food 's always good and service is efficient but not overly impressive ... they get the job done and do it well . hh is pretty good and the wine list is n't bad either . never had a dish i did n't like . i
1 yikes ! please allow 2 + hours for dining service ... the food is decent and the beer and wine selection is very good however i think the service needs a little attention . there experience we had there was just ... odd . from the host taking our name
3 never had a bad meal or a bad beer here . great selection of brews and the food that they make is simple and good . great recipe for success . service is a little spotty but expected due to the fact that these are college students who really -lrb-

3 the view alone deserves an excellent review . this restaurant is located inside the hyatt regency hotel ... a circular shaped building that spins -lrb- yes , spins -rrb- to give you a rotating view of the entire city . it 's absolutely beautiful and the ambiance is incredibly romantic
2 i was kind of annoyed while i was dining here ... thank god for alcohol and fabulous eye candy to keep me in a bubbly , happy mood . they have a selection of tacos . i like tacos . i do n't , however , like corn tortillas .

3 my best friend and i found this place via yelp after a horrendous experience at mimi 's cafe ... so happy we did ! food is great and everyone is so friendly . you can eat out on the patio with shaded tables , or you can eat inside while

4 still love it , but the shrimp pesto salad is not as great as other things on menu .
2 my third visit b/c i love the views of camelback at sunset . i love the zucchini <unk> and the pasta tastes homemade . i would have probably given four stars , but the service was <unk> ' . the prices are a bit on the high side . we

4 went to the bar downstairs . it 's bitchin ' . they tap stuff you ca n't normally get at a normal bar . the ambiance stellar . you 're literally in a wine cellar . like i said , this place is bitchin '
3 probably my favorite airport to date . the employees are warm and welcoming . there is never a crazy line at security . on thanksgiving there was no line at security ! kudos just for that . on the down side : restaurants close early , getting around the airport

2 i love the fact that this location stays open later than the mesa location -lrb- probably due to its proximity to asu -rrb- . but it just could n't top my experience at the location in mesa . if you order the deep dish crust pizza , be careful !
2 waitress was average , food was decent . if you 're a vegetarian , be sure to ask questions when you order . even though i mentioned that i was i was a vegetarian , she neglected to tell me the egg roll had pork in it . luckily i

3 i have only had the chicken wings here , but i have to say that the wings are fabulous ! the ambiance is a bit too `` <unk> '' and short of the wings i probably would not come to this place at all . the outside patio is actually

2 this is an old classic . it 's neat enough inside to go just for the hell of it . it 's like an antique or a museum piece . the drink prices are from a different era as well . if you can grab a good spot , you
2 i 've been to this place numerous times over the years and most recently last night . they 've done a bit of remodeling and raised the prices , but i 'm afraid the quality has gone down . where 's the quality control ? they got my steak wrong
1 bar smith = worst bar ever i wrote that on my cocktail napkin after being in this place for only 10 minutes . let 's just say it was n't worth battling all the <unk> streets and construction paying the $ 5 cover -lrb- i see many people complaining about
1 <unk> . came here for a monday night movie and the best part was that it was empty . the bad part was the women 's bathrooms were disgusting ! why were there a bunch of people on staff and hardly any customers , but still dirty bathrooms ? also
4 sushi , you are such a cruel <unk> ! so delicate , so <unk> prepared , such a sweet and pleasant sensation to my taste buds ; yet so pricey ! sakana is a great <unk> when in the running next to tokyo lobby . sakana carries fig vodka ,
4 best place for chicken breast ! always looks good , never suspect ! though i will walk around aimlessly , chicken is really all that i 'll buy from them .
4 amazing short rib tacos . will be back soon .
4 oh st. francis how i love thee let me count the ways is it your beauty ? is it your charms ? is it your fine , fine cuisine ? nay ! it is all !
4 go here ! great value and amazing food ! does n't look like much from the outside - but give it a chance and come on in ! fantastic lunch specials - pad thai is out of this world !! the curry is also not to be missed . service
4 trader joe 's , you complete me ! i 'm a very loyal customer ! everything i could ever want or need under one roof for great prices ! for such quality items i would expect to pay quite a bit - but trader joe 's is the true exception
4 amazing !! lunch special was very reasonable and the food was great !! maybe one of the best pad thai i have ever had . the chicken curry is very good to very thick great flavor !!
4 food is outstanding and portion sizes are large .
2 came here the other day and had the worst service ever . the food was still amazing .
3 food is always great . i love the meatloaf sandwich . the service is really hit or miss . sometimes i have great servers who are passionate about their work . other times service is just ok . the ground is always super slick and sticky and it really takes
4 price + quality = amazing i love how they use a <unk> to slice meats there . the bread is amazing chewy how a sandwich should be . i want one right now . the italian dressing homemade is amazing ask for it .
3 great service . food was good bar food nice atmosphere . great place to chill and have a beer .
3 i just got back from lunch here with a co worker , and yes i am writing this instead of working , but come on its friday . from the external appearance i was unsure as it is not in a bright , shiny and new building , the interior
3 more than just pho ` you sit at long almost communal tables with just a small gap separating you from your neighbor . prices are low but the portion sizes match that so order a few things . there is a great veggie selection , spring rolls noodle dishes even
4 i just stopped in tonight after the gym , i was a bit stinky and what better way to fix that than 16 bars of soap . it was late 8:15 when i walked in <unk> before close . this is a great time to shop when you are in
3 pros : great bread , great fresh mozzarella cheese cons : price , lack of indoor seating , lack of fountain drinks i come here for one thing and one thing only mozzarella cheese , the fire baked bread is a plus . every sandwich comes with very chewy caramel
3 start off your trip here just like the cows did , <unk> in to a long <unk> line , but you will be met by some one who takes your order not the <unk> house . if you are not a meat eater your options are limited , and on
3 i guess the lucky cat was watching over my meal because was good . i recommend you <unk> yourself with the menu when you first go in as there are many tempting options . they have typical chinese <unk> dish foods and a beautiful array vegetables for their build your
4 i showed up to this little place today with my co-worker . i was wearing business clothes , pressed wool pants ' long <unk> shirt etc. . i did not fit in or match the decor , but that did not matter . i read over the menu atop their
1 valet parking for groceries and a sandwich ? i do n't get it . i finally visited this place for lunch with some co workers . first parking was a real issue and i hate having to valet my car . once we were inside there was a very long
2 do n't be fooled by the 1950 's dancing `` girls '' with bikinis on the tv , as some are girls and some are not . this makes for a fun drinking game , but also for some awkward moments . the parking lot is small , the location
3 why would you name a restaurant after a thing designed to keep people out ? just like china this place is huge inside , and even has tanks of live fish . the menu is huge , and this is just the menu for the gringos . if you know
3 between bread or on top of lettuce , is the main choice you will make here as the vast majority of the foods are either salads , sandwiches or a few pasta options . i suggested we visit this hidden place for a team lunch one friday . the weather
3 i am still a big fan , another good rice bowl , and a po-boy this time . it was the <unk> time i ever ventured to the sandwich side of the menu <unk> i was pleased . we had a <unk> po boy which was basically mock steak peppers
1 even half off the value was just terrible and i left hungry . i have been here several times with a friend who works for the parent corporation and gets 1/2 off our bill . with the discount i felt i could try a bit more and started my meal
3 live near campus ? do n't have a back yard ? like to drink ? than casey moores might be right for you . the patio is the main attraction for me . it is like the back yard that i want but am too lazy and cheap to have
2 i came for the pasta and maybe should have had the pizza . i was looking for something different my family would try , and this place fit that bill . inside you will find real tablecloths on smallish tables . we started our meal with a fried zucchini $
3 a gastro pub is still a pub , sandwiches , pizza and fired food . maybe there is a bit of flair to make it `` gastro '' however the end result is the same . come for the brewing part and order food when you get hungry . the
3 coffee , crepes and cool hipsters , you can have a taste of all there with just one stop here . inside of a old house is jobot , prices are decent service is quick and nice and the crepe did not skimp on the basil . prices are like
2 beep beep , goes the silent death that is the light <unk> as i try to cross the street to daves electric . i <unk> in here to give it a try and have a pre a mountain hike beer , yes beer and night hiking is a decent mix
2 i have only been here twice and just to try their craft beers . so far i am impressed . my last visit i had the `` winter warner '' a spiced strong brown ale that came with some spiced ginger snap cookies that were a great pairing . i
3 water ! make sure you try a glass of water here . no , really try it , it is the best tasting water i have ever had . it must be the <unk> water they use to make the beer and the price is right . free water aside
1 you would be crazy to come here for the caprese . i liked the idea of this place but the execution along with the prices doused my enthusiasm . nearly $ 8 for a caprese is acceptable if its amazing , but here it was a salad form , cubes
2 their food is so good they need metal bars to protect it . seriously the order and pick up windows are behind bars , but it may be due to the neighborhood . this is a place the yelp is good for . there is no way you will find
3 for far to long i put this place at the rock bottom of my brewery list in town , it seems that i was mistaken . many years had passed since my last visit here , and after an invite from some friends and a good tasting at the last
2 pretty good `` american sushi '' and cheap happy hour drinks . i would never pay full price for this sushi though .
4 my boyfriend buys me one at least once a month . . sometimes we even get them at the farmer 's market in scottsdale . i have had the : orange , lavender , root beer and salted caramel flavors . salted caramel or lavender . . ca n't decide
3 - they off gluten-free breads and can do most items gluten-free here if you ask , even without the `` gf '' sign on the menu - they are a little pricey ... probably because the grass-fed beef , local produce and organic offerings ... - i really enjoyed my
4 i love visiting d & d . this place is about the atmosphere as well as the food . on the weekdays the place is bustling with corporate america , moms meeting up and exchanging baby stories , a few <unk> <unk> on a project and one or two snooty
3 there is always an interesting assortment of people in this place . perhaps being close to camelback and sort of close to central it attracts a varied crowd . everything from yoga <unk> to military to <unk> to <unk> . it is fun to people watch here . i 'm
3 love rogue for their ever changing list of great live music . the staff and owner are always friendly and the atmosphere is <unk> . so leave your <unk> outfit at home scottsdale . parking can be a pain , do n't block a house 's driveway , they will
1 been here twice - once for lunch , once for dinner . mellow is a bad name considering the location is where the old z - gallery was on mill - warehouse style , exposed brick and tall ceilings , very bright lighting and slick <unk> flooring . not a
3 holy sunday brunch batman ! i 've reviewed santan before for the regular saturday night , <unk> type of evening and it is indeed great . but look out saturday night , here comes sunday ! their mimosa 's are made with their <unk> - great ! their mojitos are
2 currently this location is closed -lrb- mill avenue -rrb- due to the fire damage - still waiting <unk> for them to open up again , but there are other locations too and the food is about the same . i always stick with a basic gyro and greek side salad
2 great <unk> home option for <unk> phoenix area . sat on the outside <unk> drinking cheap beer to watch the cars , pedestrians go by . best part , the hipster crowd had n't seem to take it over yet , so it still feels like a bar for the
1 i have only been here for lunch and would probably try it for a happy hour if their food was a bit more appetizing . for lunch i usually get a half sandwich -lrb- which is actually huge since one slice of bread is the size of a <unk> book
2 <unk> hipster bar - maybe i am getting too old for this stuff , but after a few drinks and some fun girl date company it was n't so bad , especially since this is not my scene . the roof dance floor with projector screens of trippy colors made
2 i love going to performance bike to visit sam , who always seems to be able to find me great deals . well today after completing my purchases , i left the store , and noticed this japanese music playing over the outdoor sound system . sam had reminded me
2 i tip my hat to the runners who showed up for the 2008 rock 'n' roll marathon and 1/2 marathon . not only are they good runners , but evidently they are good drivers as well . when <unk> people converge on a four block radius and all you get
3 let me start of by stating that katie was our server , and she is destined for so much more . i cant say enough about her attention to customer service . bravo ! they have good lunch specials , and great summer specials : * sunday : all day
2 for latitude eight , passion is in the presentation . their spicy thai lettuce wraps arrived <unk> , with each of the four lettuce cups containing its minced goodness and a different garnish . it was a delightful presentation . the green tea is tasty , but it is sweetened
3 my rating is based on this first review ... not on the second . on my first visit to z tejas , i went at lunchtime with 2 guys from <unk> . we had to sit at the bar since the restaurant was so crowded . as i scanned the
1 the first thing i noticed was its nice patio area . the second thing was its <unk> order process . i completely agree with gabi m , as having to wait until you reach the cashier to ask questions regarding the menu is quite annoying for us , and for
3 still impressed by their avocado egg rolls , and the accompanying dipping sauce -lrb- cilantro , honey , lime , garlic , etc -rrb- was tap dancing all over my taste buds . i 'd love to have my wife replicate that so we can test out what other foods
3 great place to see a show , with the following <unk> : - ` traditional ' concerts are best - if it 's a show where you want to jump around , dance , etc. you 're kind of limited to the space around your seat , and there is
2 the patio is great . they have a tasty house red . the service was excellent . that 's the good ... i had the pesto pasta with chicken . my girlfriend had the chicken parm . it seems it would be difficult to strip flavor from italian food but
1 for 10 + years i was a member of pure fitness but had to find an alternative when it closed . that one must have spoiled me because , to me , this place - while not horrible - is far from great . as someone below mentioned , it
3 this is a great place to go on a first date . the lights are so dim that you have no idea what the other person looks like . then when the music starts and you happen to be sitting close to it , you will have no idea what
3 the restaurant has an excellent atmosphere , service , and mission . i love that it uses local ingredients supporting farmers close by . the menu has a lot of different options and there are plenty of healthy drinks and non healthy ones to chose from . i love the
3 i love fro yo and i frequently satisfy my taste buds at any opportunity i get . menchies gets high reviews because of its unique flavors that i ca n't find at other yogurt joints . the thai tea flavor i got last time blew my mind . they always
4 ohhh baby the horchata is simply amazing . 5th star well deserved . i felt like a little kid <unk> the pecans and strawberries with a spoon at the end .
3 i would have given another star if they had n't run out of horchata . to say that my heart was broken is an understatement when i was told the news . the endless supply of chips and variety of salsas did occupy my thoughts . yet , while my
3 if you go here , get a gift card from restaurant.com . they always have specials so you get 50 % <unk> % off the cards . it ends up <unk> you $ 3 when you get a $ 25 gift card to this place . so worth it .
3 this is where i come to get some good old korean food . i have tried their tofu soups and their <unk> <unk> -lrb- i do n't know how to spell this -rrb- . their tofu soup is offered with a variety of meats , kimchi , <unk> , and
3 like others have mentioned this place is in an industrial park . this gives it an interesting feel and also <unk> out much of the crowd you might get at a place on mill or elsewhere during the fall semester -lrb- the busiest -rrb- . you just have to get
2 okay so you 're open 24 hours a day . that 's a major plus in my book , but unfortunately the meat here is n't even as good as a steak um . to their credit , their cheez whiz is real and not melted american <unk> half -
3 i like coming here because it 's only a block away from my place ! the mall is pet friendly so we take our olde english <unk> for a walk here and <unk> stop at one of the establishments to eat . the park has misters all over the place
4 so far this is the only place i 've come back to get a steak in town . i have yet to find a place in town that has a steak as tender as ruth chris 's . list of places i 've gone to recently for comparison mastro 's
3 its located in a strip mall so i did n't expect much but upon entering their establishment i could n't be any more wrong . it is a contemporary place with some pretty cool art in there . their chorizo , egg and potato is pretty good but i really
4 the best , clean , sushi fresh , all the food is out of this world , different desserts , vegetables , fruit . it is amazing . the place is clean .
0 service awful , menu changed . they charge for onions and peppers in potatoes , there cream of corn is awful , there is an herb in it and they do not tell you what it is and they say they do not know . also , there is no
4 great place and food , the staff and owners are wonderful .

2 beer is good . food is not .
2 pretty standard .
1 had the bulkogi mini plate . very cheap at $ 5 , but it 's not really bulkogi - more like a thin steak with very sweet barbecue sauce - and the rice was too sticky . the lone bright spot of the meal was probably the <unk> salad .
2 salad and bread delicious . entrees just ok .
4 jade bar has been a <unk> pad for several nights out , including a couple of new year 's <unk> and at least one anniversary celebration . the view always breathtaking , regardless of the time of day or the weather . on this particular visit , i wondered if
4 this is always an annual favorite and despite my <unk> training this year -lrb- 2009 -rrb- , i still had a great time . <unk> pick up was extremely easy and smooth . keeping with family tradition , we <unk> between the <unk> ultra stand and the `` red beans
4 it took us a year to get back , and noca is still amazing . to start , the service was great . we arrived early to enjoy a drink with friends at the bar . while it 's a very small bar , there was ample room and the
3 if you 're downtown and looking for brunch , look no further . since the last time we ate at palatte , they have changed their system from counter ordering to table service . the atmosphere in this remodeled historic home is great and the grounds outside are the perfect
2 cantina laredo was fine , but i would n't bother driving all the way out there again unless it 's because i 'm already in the area for something else . the restaurant 's decor is really nice , and it 's obvious they 're going for an `` upscale
2 i 'm not sure why i 'm bothering to review fate myself , since dozens of other people have already done so . i guess it 's because i 've become a little <unk> with the place . my husband and his friends have come here all the time for
3 while i still have n't found a cheap mexican place that compares to those in chicago , or , say ... mexico , mango 's is a nice place to come for a burrito . and their aguas frescas are really amazing -lrb- my favorite is the <unk> -rrb- .
1 <unk> ! this place , which was known for its very strong margaritas , is under new ownership . and the drinks are weak , people ! very , very sad . not that i probably need the extra alcohol , but still . . my husband and i went
3 yum ! frozen custard ! i 've been dreaming of it since i got back from a visit to green bay last summer ; -rrb- i was excited to hear that culver 's opened here in mesa -- i do n't eat their burgers , but it ' s nice
3 note : this review is simply for drinks and snacks -- i 'd like to go back here soon and eat dinner , and then revise the review . this place is beautiful ! and it has a great patio , as well as a great open-air room that is
4 ted 's is the bomb susan ! find me a better corn dog or chili cheese dog in arizona . the only place i 've had a better corn dog is at disneyland -lrb- that 's right disneyland <unk> -rrb- ted 's has really good cheese and cheese fries .
2 went here for lunch today . the service was great and the food was decent i 'm on a diet so i checked yelp for some reviews . someone recommended the mock chicken wings . so that 's what i had and my sister had the soup and salad .
3 this is actually a really nice library but growing up here i guess i take it for granted . has lot 's of computers and large child 's section . it 's under renovation now and there were quite a few homeless people sleeping in the library lol , so
1 i use to go to logan 's in tennessee when i was in the army . i 'd normally get so <unk> it did n't matter what the food tasted like , but now the chain has been in az for a while and i no longer drink . this
3 if this place is average it 's only because you 've lived in arizona your whole life and have been spoiled by great mexican food . they have the best salsa hands down ! the bean burro enchilada style is awesome and so is the green burro . it 's
3 dined at four peaks brewing co. for the first time last night and let me tell you , it was delicious . the place was pretty busy for a wednesday night but from what i understand thats pretty normal for them . and after my experience i understand why .
3 ah , our first trip to windsor . let me tell you it was an <unk> moment filled with sunshine , <unk> , <unk> , and joy . my boyfriend and i discovered windsor recently and decided we just had to try their brunch . we enjoyed the matador -lrb-
3 the food here is super delicious ! i 've lived close to this place for a couple of months now and one evening i was feeling like i really needed to try something new . this place was my first introduction to ethiopian cuisine and this place definitely impressed me
3 my first experience at essence was wonderful . found a spot out on the patio which was great despite the view of the busy street . the people working there were super friendly and the atmosphere was light and fun . lots of random people chit chatting and enjoying their
2 this place is tucked away on a side street right off of north scottsdale road . away from the busy main street and all the other loud obnoxious restaurants -lrb- people -rrb- scottsdale is filled with . there is one woman in particular who works here who is an absolute
3 i love this filthy little shithole ! i have eaten here countless times and swear that i had reviewed it before ... guess not ? much bigger menu than maxim down the street . i like them both , maxim maybe has better soup ? , but it 's great
1 i live down the block from here , and ordered a pizza from there once . the owner delivered it himself and we chatted for a few minutes . the pizza - i 've had better . the crust was kind of under cooked and there was n't much cheese
3 i <unk> me some famous dave 's . i first visited one in nebraska on a business trip about 7 years ago , we ate there about 7 times over 2 weeks . no joke . i took a client out to lunch today , and he said , ``

3 i was in the hood and visited for lunch today ... was super impressed . i ordered the special , which was a japanese hamburger . the beef was tender and delicious . the burger was huge , and had a tasty sauce which made the burger , like ,
1 bland , uninspired , mushy . i had 2 fish and 1 bean taco . the beans were good - the rest of the tacos , not so much ! they were kind of <unk> together . no fountain drinks - cans and bottles only . so much for being
2 the why : <unk> by chef <unk> campbell and highly praised by local palates i respect crudo seems to have all the things i 'd hope for in a local restaurant ; high quality <unk> , a strong sense of community , and a unique but focused menu - in

4 efficient , simple to get to , and centrally located . great <unk> to pretty much everywhere i need to go . if i end up moving to phoenix i 've no doubt we will be friends -lrb- and your free wi-fi and lightrail access do n't hurt that relationship
2 full review in the blog . this place has potential , but thus far that potential is not fully realized . seven plates , four desserts ... and a $ 1 ` bread <unk> ' `` shrimp and grits , '' a savory and intense <unk> of sweet and snappy

3 <unk> , nice enough , and did n't smell like smoke . pretty much your standard casino without a lot of personality but overall clean , upscale , and with friendly patrons and employees .
4 full review blogged : crostini di <unk> alla fiorentina : $ 5 . nothing complicated here , just rough ground chicken liver pate over homemade toasted bread with a bit of parsley . served chilled and ample in portion , no complaints . <unk> : $ 18 . the most
4 if every fry 's was like this one i 'd frequent them more often . between the covered parking , bulk selection , and good prices i personally think they are better than the whole foods down the street for staple items and while their prices are higher for some
4 part 3 : ricotta mousse , sour cherry : another one bite <unk> there is nothing to say about this dish that ca n't be guessed from the ingredients - smooth as ice cream and rich as cheesecake they could have served me a bowl for dessert and i 'd

3 went there today as a result of so many good reviews on yelp . our experience was the same as many of your other reviewers . my wife was reluctant to go there because of it 's location but because others said it was fine , in we went .
4 you heard it here first . texaz grill which does an outstanding job across their whole menu , has now started a sunday brunch !! went there today and it 's outstanding . they have regular items on their <unk> menu but they also have some others : <unk> scramble
4 what in the world is such an upscale , nice , delightful , charming restaurant doing in a strip mall ? i probably should drop a star because of that location , but i did n't . i had the vegetable soup & veal marsala . companion had pasta .

3 i ca n't complain
3 good place for a very nice dinner . we went for an anniversary and they really impressed us ! guys , make sure they know it is your anniversary when you make the reservation .
1 i liked it but it seemed over priced and not impressive enough to return .
3 everything is good . i put 5 stars on the tempe location .
4 i 'm long overdue for a review for this place - my favorite bar in arizona . as a craft beer fan -lrb- i try not to say `` snob '' ... -rrb- , i 'm overwhelmed with a place with this good a selection of beers that i 've
3 for those who do n't eat beef -lrb- like me -rrb- , there 's a good selection of chicken and even a vegetarian option . that 's unlike 5 guys , whose vegetarian option is toppings on a bun -lrb- still pretty good , but still ... -rrb- . smashburger
4 what a fantastic tuna sandwich -lrb- sicilian tuna melt : preserved sicilian tuna , capers , olives , cheddar , <unk> -lsb- sauce -rsb- , arugula , $ 10.50 -rrb- with salad . very useful for a quick to-go lunch , though a bit higher priced than the average .
3 first time visiting bjs last night and i thoroughly enjoyed what i ordered : bbq ranch chicken salad with avocado added . the salad was fricken huge and i loved the crispy onions on top . it was cold and refreshing and divine ! hubby got the california burger and
3 had their jalapeno cheese mashed potato pie . tasty and spicy but very small . pretty much like a small potato pancake . get the sweet potato fries instead of your side . they are delectable !
3 i used to go here for lunch all the time when i worked out there . the food was spectacular and the service was always friendly and quick . i always got the stuffed tomatoes with chicken salad which came on a bed of greens with their non fat raspberry
3 it 's been far too long since i have been here which is sad because its probably one of my faves for chili rellenos . i always get the shredded beef rellenos with the cheese sauce and double papa 's and it is lovely ! their chips are also nice

3 i went to bosa yesterday and to be honest , i am pretty dam torn . i believe i do like krispy kremes yeast doughnuts better though . bosa 's yeast doughnuts although <unk> and larger , are simply not as light and airy as krispy kremes yeast doughnuts .
3 by far one of my favorite bbq joints in az ! i love me some bbq but am also all about the sides . if i go to a bbq place that has terrible sides , no matter how good the meat is , i most likely will not return
3 i was afraid that maybe this place wouldnt be that great but i actually really liked it . i booked a table for a bachelorette party i was hosting . never having gone here , i was not sure what to expect and if this would be a great place
4 a no <unk> eatery ... you get your greek on and feel great afterwards . my usual is the traditional , nothing special but always delicious . i almost always get things to go as the place is normally sweltering hot , decorated with crazy random and old posters of
3 so this is my local coffee shop . there 's something about this place , leaving the busy street outside to the absolutely chill vibe of echo ... maybe its just the thought that i 'm about to enjoy some primo coffee . when i read rachel 's review of
3 went on a thursday for hh and pre-game before a comedy show down the street . place was hoppin , and rightfully so . the ambiance is lively yet casual and laid back . folks were trendy , boys in their new bright <unk> shirts <unk> a sake bomb ,
3 my wife and i went back a couple days ago and really enjoyed it this time . the beer was cold . the food was tasty and hot . and the waiter was very nice . we will be coming back .
4 me and my wife loved it ! went for cinco de mayo and had great drinks and food ? sat at the bar and had great service ! we will be coming back !!
4 great place ! everything we have here is great as we always find a reason to come back ! try the ahi tune ! it 's not on the menu , but they will make it for you . it 's awesome !
4 first visit recently and i thought highly of it ... pro 's - value . for the lunch price and what you get , it 's a great value !! -lrb- that 's what earned the 5th star -rrb- - quality of food i felt was very good . had
3 been coming here for 15 years ... pro 's - variety on bowl options many - quality of produce good - staff friendly and helpful con 's - maybe a tad over priced by $ 1 or so . never liked the new smaller metal bowls . will continue visiting
3 consistently good . pro 's - many soup options and all consistently <unk> - salad options good as well - staff have been there over time , friendly con 's - would like red bell pepper from time to time - cookies on desert bar would be great good place
4 holy <unk> , do i love this place ! it 's my new favorite weekend breakfast hangout . brak and i have figured out how to maneuver at liberty market -lrb- best tip : get in the door before 9 -rrb- and have had about six good breakfasts in a
4 rosa 's is the only mexican place i like in the east valley . they serve <unk> , seemingly authentic mexican , with fresh ingredients and good service . do n't be put off by the <unk> , no <unk> <unk> crappy shopping plaza ... just park in the ample
3 finally , a little taste of wisconsin has come to the valley ! i remember two things about culvers from my days in the north woods : it 's really unhealthy and really tasty . so when i saw they had opened up in my neighborhood , i just kept
3 loved hanging out here last friday night . the place was packed ! luckily , my friends and i got there early , about 8:45 ish . we were able to secure ourselves some stools in a great spot near the bar . soul power was playing , and they
4 my roommate and i were at westgate , and jonesing for some sushi . i had been to kabuki a couple of times before and enjoyed it , so we went on up ! we sat at the sushi bar , our favorite place to sit when we go out
4 `` how will short leash be able to translate all the good things about their food truck into a sit down restaurant ? '' was my only question when i ventured over to roosevelt row last week . imagine my surprise when i had all of my expectations topped .
0 this place has a cool , retro chic thing going for it as far the interior is concerned but all the <unk> ends there . first off , the entrance is kind of awkward . as soon as you walk into the `` bistro '' you are in the middle
2 i finally tried this place and honestly it tastes like other good gelato shops . the hassle of the parking lot and rude drivers just gives me anxiety . i 'd rather not get stressed out before i try to enjoy dessert . the next time i eat at la
4 what else is there to say ? this place is amazing . great wine . yummy food . excellent staff . beautiful neighborhood . <unk> interior . i love the garage door indoor/outdoor seating . i could waste my entire paycheck here . better yet ; i can move in
4 i love breakfast here ! hands down the best breakfast i have ever had -lrb- sorry mom -rrb- . they have all the basics plus you can build your own scrambles , omelets , etc. . i love their vegetarian style scrambles . the portions are so large that you
3 how bowling alleys stay so busy - blows my mind . is it just me , or every time i 've ever tried to go bowling i get told `` it 's league night , so we only have 1 open lane and there 's already a wait '' .
4 i must admit , i 'm a massive fan of postino arcadia and phx ... years ago , when i heard they were building a -lrb- cue dramatic and skeptical voice -rrb- <unk> location i turned up my nose . fast forward a few years , i own a house
2 there are two types of people ; those who can get past lackluster service , and those who ca n't . 5-stars for those who can , and 1-star for those who ca n't . i must <unk> the average , and therefore award 3 stars . this last weekend
3 despite the mixed reviews , i had to give this place a try since it 's nearby and has the unique setting of being underground . people are right when they say you can smell seafood as soon as you enter , but it kind of added to the ambiance
0 besides the girl at the counter being friendly , this is as bad as it gets . fake flavor , sickly sweet and runny , no substance yogurt . as a bonus , you 'll enjoy the pretentious ambiance with loud , irritating music . all the positive reviews must
1 the 2 star rating is indicative of the pizza only , and since this is a pizza joint , i think that is appropriate . there 's no reason to discuss `` authentic neapolitan '' blah , blah , blah . when something is bland , it 's not memorable
2 my first 3 star review . i usually only review a place that is exceptional or poor , but since the choices for good chinese food are so <unk> in the valley , one has to make concessions . i 've been here twice , the first time being told
4 short leash dogs is my favorite treat ! you can always find them at the farmers market on saturdays , at food truck fridays and back at the public market on wednesdays . my favorite dogs are of the beer battered variety , and my favorite dog is the igby
3 i went to blanco on a thursday night for happy hour . we arrived right around 4:30 and were seated immediately . our table was right between the dining room and the patio , so we were able to take advantage of the beautiful breeze without having to sit outside
4 i did it ! that 's right , i hiked all the way to the top of camelback mountain . and not just me , but my boyfriend and my toy australian shepherd , frankie . if you take nothing else from my review , please note that this is
3 two visits to the cafe zuzu , i should probably write a review ... my first visit was on valentine 's day . we had just finished up at the chihuly exhibit at the desert botanical garden and were desperate for a place to eat . being that it was
4 that 's a wrap is one of my all-time favorite <unk> spots ! if you like wraps and have n't eaten at that 's a wrap yet , you need to do so immediately ! their menu is fantastic , with tons of delicious , <unk> delights . and it
4 one of my biggest disappointments in having to abandon gluten has been missing out on the unbelievable sandwiches from sacks . grilled chicken , freshly sliced ham , chunks of turkey ... whatever you want , they 've got it ! <unk> wheat , rye , sourdough or spinach wrap
4 wow , outstanding . had the eggplant parm sandwich - -lrb- half - it was a huge half -rrb- , and it was so delicious . the cheese was melted just perfectly . my boyfriend had the il <unk> - w/o the meat since i 'm a vegetarian so we
4 i 'm not even sure why i 'm writing a review since the amazingness of this place is not in question <unk> ... holy crap . bloody mary 's are outstanding . guacamole is so tasty . the fish torta is maybe the best sandwich in the valley . fresh
4 i loooooove restaurant mexico !!! i grew up in tempe and have been going to restaurant mexico for as long as i can remember , at all of its various locations over the years . it is , without question , my favorite restaurant in arizona , and the best
3 this place has been one of my faves for a while now . you can make your own pizza or try one of their combos . my gf likes the greek . i like the natural and the classic . it 's got a cozy atmosphere and a friendly staff
3 this is the new thai basil location at park central mall . i am happy to report it is much like its tempe location in food quality . i had the thai basil and it was just as delicious as the tempe location . i went during the lunch rush
3 yay i 'm glad we found this place . i would have given five stars , but i 've only tried them once . very fast take-out time and excellent pizza . we ordered a large with italian sausage , mushrooms , and black olives . spinato 's did not
3 sugar free white mocha iced . really nice people and the coffee is good too . they really want to make sure you like it . if you dont they will make it again . get a stamp card too your 11th one is free . monday or tuesday is
3 this place is pretty cool . right off mill ave and open till 3 am . i love the inside it has a cool little vibe and a back door that goes right out to the patio of fat tuesday , cantina , handlebar etc. .
0 smash was good the first few times but this location is lacking . my first bad experience here was when i called in to place an order and the guy taking my order gave me a real hard time . i asked for a smash burger with cheese no ketchup
3 nothing wrong with this place . good food -lrb- not great but darn tasty -rrb- and service is always good -lrb- not great except on occasion . -rrb- my kids and i like to eat here in the afternoons -lrb- close to their school -rrb- because the appetizers are half-price
3 ate there with my kids <unk> . gon na go with 3.75 stars overall , rounded up to 4 . service was good , prompt , polite , and efficient , and the place was clean and tidy . 4.5 stars for those items . we had : side caesar
3 this place <unk> . cheap <unk> pita bread , and the cashiers are very cute . excellent for this type of food .
4 following up on the recent review by another yelper : this is not a `` fast food sit-down '' experience . food is cooked when you order , by a small but caring staff , and the dishes come out when they are ready . nothing is going to sit
3 have to add my fine regards to this little truck . i had the `` devil dog '' and it was indeed fairly spicy . and i 'm the guy in my group who loves it `` so hot my face sweats '' so when i say something is fairly
3 i 'm gon na have to side with the 4 + star folks on this one . there really just * is * something about the pizza that makes it tasty . i could n't identify what it was , but it just tastes good , and that 's what
1 short and sweet : staff was very friendly . phoenix burger - fairly decent bar burger . nothing to write home about . coleslaw - inedible . i do n't know what their seasoning of choice is , but it was gross . steak fries - pretty decent version .
4 great place to spend a hot hot phoenix day ... and as always , such a scene ... this is a gigantic place with absolutely beautiful stores . we went on a <unk> degree sunday so we knew it would be busy but since it is so big , the
4 can a cocktail and tapas on a wednesday night be sexy ? the answer ... yes ! very ... very ... sexy ... i had the <unk> pleasure of dining at sol y sombra this evening with my best friend and we had a beautiful experience . we made a
4 have you ever had one of those meals where every taste and every texture was an experience for your taste buds ? that was the way i felt about my meal at hana 's . when i lived in michigan , my best friend and i used to get together
2 i will be honest , i think your best bet with this place would be to go for happy hour -lrb- $ 5 wine , $ 5 appetizers -rrb- or on a date where someone else is paying . really really amazing food but i just got home and am
3 this is the 2nd movie theater i have been to since moving to arizona . i thought it was fine and just like any other movie theater i have been to that is connected to a mall . yes , there were several shady characters <unk> around after we got
2 okay , so i actually like mama java 's coffee , expect for they looked at me crazy the other day when we asked for cream . last i checked cream and sugar are the coffee standards . anyway , my problems lies in what has happened in the coffee
0 was so excited to hear that a new thai place was opening since i felt thai lahna has fallen short over the last few years . well huge disappointment , i got my all time go to dish the pad thai . i can not describe how bad it was
3 fox got it right on this one . great location and blows deluxe out of the water . the food is spot on and service was great ... short of it , for those not wanting to read the whole review - big patties that are juicy on a great
1 ok so i had really high hopes for this place and felt pretty let down . i 've heard tons of great things about the food , i just didnt have the same warm fuzzy feelings about it . it was nice to have good music but i felt it
3 avocado pizza was decent . the shop next store is very cute and a nice way to pass time while you wait for a table . or if you go for breakfast its a nice way to pass a few mins . i was disappointed the last time i was
2 3.5 stars howie burger was good but nothing earth <unk> . i had great service and the ambience is nice . nothing over the top though or that i would say you must visit while you are in phx .
4 always love coming to this location . good service . great pizza . i 'm crust lover and everything i 've tried is great . i 'm definitely a fan of the sausage there . i 'm quite the pizza lover and there are a lot of let downs in
4 good oj . good pizza sample . the cafeteria style is kinda cool but usually it can be so busy that its frustrating ! the bacon is very thick which is a great change compared to all the greasy spoon breakfast joints . the oatmeal is good and hugely <unk>
4 very cool secret sunday ! 4 free drinks -lrb- wine or mojito -rrb- , bruschetta , salad , pizza and olives ! friend them on facebook for a chance too be on their first list !
2 portlands , <unk> . maybe we caught you on a bad night . the pizza which is usually wonderful was a bit burned on the edge . we had already waited a while after placing the order so i did n't bother sending it back . but what really urged
2 always crowded on <unk> , always hard to find a place to park , always a good pour on guinness , always friendly help , always loud inside , always a good enough time . i actually prefer seamus ' downtown , but rosie 's is good enough .
2 in addition to the nice atmosphere on the patio they serve a very nice brunch menu and the $ 2 bloody marys are a buy . downside : parking validation is only a discount , not a <unk> . depending on when you go the service can be slow .
3 hmm , did n't expect to like it very much , but actually ... it 's not bad . happy hour runs from 3 to 7 every night and means almost everything on the menu is half-price . i enjoyed a decent vodka martini and shared a charcuterie board with
3 the location , atmosphere , and overall vibe is just right . it 's like being in a moderately stylish , <unk> friends house . i had the chorizo dates as an appetizer . delightful ! these alone are enough to pull me back anytime i 'm in town .
3 it 's <unk> . i knew by the way the <unk> were <unk> that this would be a <unk> sort of place , and i was n't disappointed . what i liked about it : the dj was loud as hell but isolated to the front lounge section . if
4 yes , just about every <unk> bar -lrb- meaning one that 's not part of a hotel or something -rrb- tries to claim <unk> status by littering their walls with <unk> tv 's and <unk> each to some different game . well ... see ... anyone can do that ,
3 yes , this is worth making a trip for . the happy hour menu is inexpensive and innovative -lrb- try out the asian nachos -rrb- , the sushi has been fresh on every visit , and some of the combos on the <unk> underground menu -lrb- ok maybe not so
3 tuesday night is not the night to go to gypsy bar . friday is better . saturday better still . on tuesday nights you will likely be one of five people in the audience listening to an elderly , <unk> woman <unk> out a <unk> song accompanied by a karaoke
3 the mission statement of trader joe 's at one time -lrb- at least <unk> -rrb- was to bring good things to the <unk> of <unk> . that is , to the lives of the educated , discerning yet <unk> . at tj 's you can get things like good table
3 for a <unk> period this summer and early fall , ck 's was a remote office as well as a saturday night hangout for me . fond memories , actually . good : very good wifi snappy service <unk> menu items good patio where you can smoke cigars live music
3 what 's to like about this funky <unk> <unk> from the 1960 's ? lots of things : drink deals . tall doubles for $ 3.50 on the wells the night we were there . they have stella and some other good beers on tap . live music and cool
3 dark , cool , comfy , and serving up some of the best <unk> i 've had in the valley . guinness with a shamrock on top . a good place to wait out the hottest part of the afternoon . it probably is n't an `` authentic '' irish
2 i 'm not a big fan of water parks but golfland is usually a fun time . there is a huge selection of arcade games . which makes for lots of fun times . there are 2 mini gold courses that are fun but usually swamped with middle school kids
2 i actually dont mind qdoba . this tempe location was nice . like the other reviewers have said , it 's basically chipotle . and to me there is basically no difference . the only thing that qdoba has on chipotle is that i like the tortillas at qdoba better
4 seriously , ikea has everything you need when it comes to getting the necessities for a new home , college student or kids room . yeah , its not always the best quality stuff but the selection is amazing . the place is a giant maze but its to the
2 this place i totally forgot about . a friend use to take me here years ago and i forgot how good it was . the chips and salsa are ok , but not the best . this is not <unk> mexican but it is good and very affordable . the
3 i like san tan village . even though i do not go in the summer cause it is to hot . but i guess i dont go anywhere outdoors here in the summer . anyways i like the selection of stores . its alot nicer than the other mall options
2 this place has a crappy location and hardly any parking . the employees are kinda <unk> , which was kinda expected . the cupcakes themselves where actually good . i had the banana one and red velvet . they both were good . the price is borderline retarded . they
3 first time today ... finally -- i 've been wanted to check out , but just have never ventured over . met my friend jack , of social latte , today for our take on `` america 's taco shop '' . i did n't <unk> the yelp reviews first
3 review # 100 that 's right ... i am a fan of my hometown airport . free wifi ... paradise bakery ... plenty of starbucks ... a first <unk> status line at security ... if you have a club card , the us airways club lounge in the a gates
3 this is my `` go-to '' wf , the one that i frequent the most . the staff is always friendly . yes , things may be a bit pricier here -- but i feel like it 's better for me , better quality , and/or bfe . so there
3 3.75 * 's rounded up to 4 . had a 2 hour <unk> business meeting with a client here . it was nice and quiet at 4 ... but the noise was roaring when we left around 6pm . white chocolate grill ... like others , i was n't sure
4 you have to love this place . i 'm not good with the catchy names , but i 'll describe what i had . it was the chili cheese dog with cole slaw on top . the all beef hot dog was truly the star of the show , but
0 this is terrible food . i 've had some not so great chinese food before , but this place is by far the worst . it does n't help to call it `` asian '' to avoid authenticity complaints . it 's just bad . the beef must have been
3 if you ever wished you had a really cool yard , filled with fun games like ping pong and cornhole , decorated with fashionable , comfy furniture , populated with trendy cenpho families and couples , and attended by a helpful , hip waitstaff , serving delicious food and creative
4 super cute place from the owners of <unk> pizza . they have about 12 flavors of ice cream , yogurt , and sorbets that are constantly rotating , and i have n't had a bad one yet . my most recent order was <unk> sorbet -lrb- tart and refreshing -rrb-
3 thumbs up - i thought sidebar was pretty cool . they have a really cool & interesting cocktail list -lrb- that is the first time i have seen horchata in a drink ... and it was delicious ! -rrb- and the prices are decent . the inside is kind of
3 i have had nothing but great experiences at citizen public house . while i 'll start off by saying that i know some of the items can be a bit overpriced , or possibly a lot overpriced , i 'm taking into account the expensive scottsdale location , and expensive
2 a-ok describes steve 's <unk> grill perfectly in my opinion . it 's somewhat like a cracker barrel minus the company backing and plus sports ... a rather kitsch design scheme with loud colors , loud tvs , and loud alcohol advertisements hung all around , a large and eclectic
3 i know it 's a chain . i know it 's a fast food burger joint . i know they have a small menu . i know . but damn , is it good . and damn , do they try their hardest to make fast food with quality ingredients
2 kristen here . kevin and i have been to cadillac ranch on several occasions , and each time we walk away satisfied , but never thrilled . during our last visit , we attended happy hour -lrb- half off appetizers ! -rrb- about 5pm on a weekday . the place
4 perfect pizza . plain and simple , i have had none better . grimaldi 's in old town is almost exactly my <unk> of a perfect restaurant . to die for food , a romantic yet lively interior , a great jazzy soundtrack , dimmed but not too dark lighting
1 i really want to like cheba hut ... i just ca n't do it . i 've been trying it again and again for some nine years now and i have decided it 's just not going to work . the sandwiches are too bready and often too toasted making
4 huevos rancheros ! i must ask my fiancee on every one of my days off if we can go to harlow 's . i just love the atmosphere , kind of a 1950 's diner feel with old movie posters on the walls and all the waitresses call you ``
3 cheap , delicious , and greasy . if that 's not a winning combination for a fast food mexican joint , i do n't know what is . yes , it 's pretty similar to filiberto 's and los favoritos and <unk> 's and all the other `` berto 's
4 this bookstore is the love of my life . i would love to become a children 's author someday , so i am always on the lookout for bookstores with a great selection of children 's literature . changing hands has a wide variety of books and gadgets for book
2 los taquitos is good , you will like it , but it 's nothing extraordinary . it 's another place i do n't quite understand why is on the food network . i like their carne asada and the way they season it , i like their beans , pretty
3 top 's liquor is seriously on point . they have tons of options , and for the most part it is <unk> in an easy to find way , they have aisles of <unk> brews , local stuff and hard to find booze . they do n't have what you
1 okay , what is everyone ordering here because i recently had dinner here with my bf and we both thought it was very mediocre . we tried 4 different types of rolls and the mixed tempura and thought everything was just okay . the best thing was the dragon roll
1 boo , for their customer service . i knew they carried stella rosa , but i went in hopes that they may have the variety of flavors stella rosa comes in also , particularly peach . i asked an employee and he was very persistent that it does not come
4 great lunch specials at $ 10 or less and a massive amount of food . i alternate between the sakana lunch and the chicken matsuri . today i had the chicken matsuri lunch . it came with two big <unk> of sliced up chicken <unk> with this teriyaki like sauce
3 today i had the chicago dog and while it was good i probably wont be ordering it again . it 's slightly pricy for what it is . i 've had the italian beef and the burger on previous visits and enjoyed these items much more . the burgers and
3 very cute , little neighborhood spot . it 's a nice place to grab a simple brunch or lunch with or without friends . they have a big community table suitable for solo dining . their pizzas are top notch . i 'm a sucker for wood fire pizzas and
4 came here with some friends for food and drinks . awesome experience . joe at the bar was amazing ! very friendly and attentive . all our drinks were done right . food was good . we had a burger , some wings and waffle fries . next time ,
4 this place has really good bagels . i do n't crave bagels often , but when i do i come here . my favorite is the spinach pesto . this is probably the only place i 've seen with this flavor . i like mines toasted with plain butter .
3 this place has very good sandwiches and wraps . the roast beef is made in house -lrb- i believe -rrb- and really good . the vermonter , which is their version of thanksgiving in a sandwich is also tasty . they also have daily specials that offer pretty unique <unk>
2 i come here when my friend visits from out of town as she loves this place . personally i think it 's just alright , but then again i am not a huge bbq fanatic . my favorite thing here is the cornbread with the sweet honey butter ! these
3 i 'm wrestling between 3 and 4 stars , but they had a live band playing frank sinatra and that 's just damn <unk> -lsb- yes i know i made that word up -rsb- , so it gets 4 . i loved the ambiance . low lighting , not too
3 i love this place , perhaps more than yc 's . the food is fresh & the selection of fresh veggies is awesome . one thing <unk> little bowls they give you are n't cutting it ! i tend to overload on veggies and find myself making a mess &
4 it had been a great long while since i had been to cheba hut . i recalled a tiny establishment with almost no places to sit and a friendly staff that took a little while to make your food but it was well worth the wait . a few days
4 i was so excited that i finally got to go to sweet republic . my boyfriend hyped it up -lrb- as he is a very avid lover of ice cream -rrb- and he was <unk> place is awesome ! maybe it 's the fact that they have jameson irish cream
4 i came here with my daughter per her <unk> that i would fall in love with the burgers here . we came on a thursday during lunch time and the place was packed !! we both ordered a double cheeseburger and then made one a combo meal , we shared
2 i took my daughter here for a late lunch . service was great through the whole dining experience and the place is decorated in 1950 's style . i had the hot dog with cheese and chips for $ 5.50 , my daughter had the cheeseburger and chips for $
1 came back here on a wednesday afternoon to redeem my complimentary meals with my daughter . when we arrived there was only one table occupied , yet it took about 10 minutes before someone came to our table , as we were waiting i noticed a fly flying around inside
1 this is gon na be short and sweet , included is a pic of the chicken salad sandwich that was picked up for lunch . enough said .
3 i went here with my husband and his cousin . this was my first time here and was assured by the cousin that it was yummy . the husband and i got the catfish , bbq beef sandwich , fries , beans and a drink . i have to say
4 hello ranch market , nice to finally meet you ! since moving to my new hood i have fallen in love with this store . they have things i have never seen before anywhere else . i am so overwhelmed when i go here , i am in sensory overload
4 i think enough has been said about cherry blossom so i 'm going use this review to <unk> my love for <unk> soba . when i was 18 i spent nearly a month in japan in the sister city exchange program . it was during the summer and my host
3 nobody 's reviewed this place yet ?? probably because nobody knows it exists . i did n't know myself . i could barely even find the place . what a cool divey bar/restaurant . i along with my coworkers all ordered burgers and they did n't disappoint . while not
2 hmm ... not bad . not spectacular . was n't too impressed with the bored - looking high school girl behind the counter . super cute ambience . it felt like i ate my carne asada burrito in about five seconds . yes , because it was great but also
4 love copper star . there 's something about it that is so <unk> . whenever i need to hide from my crappy job i can always count on copper star to be there , waiting with good coffee and a cupcake . warm , inviting and never swarming with annoying
4 what exactly is a noodles ranch ? a ranch that <unk> noodles ? if so , i want to live there . it always makes me giggle as i think of the <unk> ' <unk> , where <unk> dynamite gets his haircut . i also admit to knowing nothing about

4 while i lived in charlotte , nc , <unk> mills -lrb- same company -rrb- passed the blue ridge <unk> as the # 1 tourist attraction in the state . arizona mills blows that one away ! this location is bigger -- at least it seemed that way while walking it
4 i do n't give five stars very often , but yes pappadeaux 's deserves them all . coming from the east coast , i do miss my seafood . i 'm a bit wary of any seafood i get in the valley because it obviously has to be flown or
4 yep -- still my favorite hole-in-the-wall eatery awesomeness . the brisket sandwich with cheddar and slaw and <unk> ' sauce was to die for . i ate at the bar and just enjoyed my visit . ca n't wait til i can walk here !
2 i needed a place to eat breakfast while my stuff was en route from nc -- joe 's diner is nearby so decided to give it a try . the place was packed , so i snagged a spot at the bar . the breakfast burrito looked good , and
4 alice cooper 's town is a mix of good food and rock 'n' roll , and has a fab bar . being one of the world 's biggest alice cooper fans , i also loaded up on alice stuff at the merchandise area before leaving . the walls are covered
4 this place is not okay for me ... i have gained serious pounds eating here . i am that person that <unk> out the sushi bar and crab legs like a fiend . yeah , i 'm that girl . the sushi is okay for a buffet , but the
4 the cupcakes ! oh , the cupcakes . i frequent joe 's but always passed over this place . i work at a coffee shop so i just was n't interested . i 'm so glad i stopped in ... the red velvet cupcake was to die for . seriously
2 the best attribute to this place is the patio . there 's a great fire pit in back with couches . the music is good . i like it . i 've only been after 10 so keep that in mind . this place is always packed on the weekends
3 if you 're in search for fresh delicious sushi in phoenix , you should definitely try this spot . i 'm not into rolls so much , so if you want trendy overpriced gringo sushi then you might want to head over to pure sushi in scottsdale . i 've
3 this place has a really great <unk> back elegance . i love the energy that the large bar in the center of the space creates . my only complaint is that the lack of soft surfaces <unk> to an incredibly loud atmosphere . on to the food ! i 've
2 if you do n't want to read the whole review , i 'll sum it up in one sentence -- via delosantos only uses yellow cheese . i went here about 4 years ago for a celebratory occasion , and was afraid to eat the food based on the smell
4 easley 's really is the best you can get in town . i have been to a number of shops , and you are wasting a ton of time at those places ... really you are ~ what to do ~ anytime year round you can stroll in here looking

4 i am going to gush about this place ... sorry ... i might go overboard , sue me . i absolutely love caffe boa . this is not associated with the one on mill . please disregard them when comparing the two . its apples and oranges . this site
2 i 've been debating on whether or not to give this spot two or three stars . i used to be a huge fan of everything about the vig . great patio , great bar , great food , great laughs , but the one thing that was never great
4 i miss 6 and ca n't wait for the new spot to open up . i know that they are going to be rocking it hard . i spent many a good nights in this perfect combination of scottsdale <unk> , great drinks , good times and good music .
3 i have to start this post off by saying that the four stars is in relation to phoenix sushi restaurants . it does not include some of my favorites in san francisco , hawaii or vegas . stingray has become my favorite sushi joint in the phoenix area . i
4 driving up to this establishment , you would have no idea what was to come . this is one of the best mexican food establishments in a strong mexican food market . located at 16th street and thomas , heading into a little bit older area of town , you
1 went here for dinner with girlfriends on tues. . was n't blown away . it was difficult for me to find as there is no signage . i finally had to ask someone after wandering around for 15 mins . the service was lackluster . our server gave us the
2 i like it ! awesome concept . it 's literally the subway of sushi . a great option if you want something healthy but do n't feel like a sandwich or salad . there are rolls you can choose from but you can also make your own . first timers
4 very different and fun dining experience ! i was thrilled to see posh was participating in restaurant week because i 've been wanting to try this restaurant for awhile but it is just out of my price range . $ 40 restaurant week menu and off i went ! our

4 i went to the new postino in gilbert this weekend and was so impressed i stopped in the arcadia location since i was in the neighborhood . blown away once again ... i was actually reluctant bringing my 2 and 4 year old to a hipster wine bar but when
4 i 'm lactose intolerant and this place was so worth the bubble guts -lrb- sorry tmi -rrb- . there was a pretty long line when we pulled up fri night . but i was pleasantly surprised that it moved really fast . so do n't let the line deter you
2 i discovered spinatos at the scottsdale culinary festival this year . tonight the hubby had a pizza craving and lo and behold , this spinatos is pretty close to us . we ordered mamma 's special or favorite -lrb- i forget the exact name - the one with fresh spinach
2 ok i 'm going to leave my rating at 3 stars because this place is a hit or miss . we were here the other night for happy hour and had such a great experience we came back on fri for dinner . not happy . my margarita was not
3 when i want to gorge myself on salad , breads , and pizza , this is where i go . delicious .
3 i really liked my food , the service was quick and the place was nice . definitely a place to go again .
2 clean , friendly . i 'm not a big fan of their food though , but i will go there on occasion . i like how its a small menu .
1 i was n't impressed . i got carded . really ? i 'm 37 and have visible gray . i 'd rather go next door to seamus ' .
4 i 'm a little sad . i completed course ii and have to wait a bit until i can take course <unk> and it will be under the new <unk> format . i am very happy though that i have taken the cake decorating courses , meeting the nice people
3 brought my wife here to shop on her birthday , she got amazing customer service and prices were n't that crazy . not a bad place , except for trying to leave , traffic normally sucks when trying to leave .
2 my sandwich was tasty . it was ready soon after i ordered it . pretty good . i 'd go again .
2 it was so busy that the wait staff were very disorganized .
4 very tasty gyros !
3 my friends and i eat here on occasion . it 's very good . the service is fair , as i 've never had to look up and wonder where my order is . the staff come by often to see if we are ok or to give us updates
3 had my brothers bachelor party there . service was great . food was good and the drinks kept coming . the price was fair and expected for the size of our party . our waitress amy was awesome . my guests and brother had a great time .
4 stingray is great ! really , coming from me about a scottsdale establishment of any kind is rather bizarre , i know , but i always have a great time , not entirely too much douchebaggery happening , and they keep their patio appropriately <unk> . the bar booths are
2 i am beyond <unk> for the hot and sour soup . it 's <unk> spicy , <unk> as local <unk> if you eat it too fast . i like the squishy little noodle things , they temporarily <unk> the scorching madness . i 'm total glutton for punishment when it
3 i really enjoy postino . it 's so comfortable and a real class act . of course the wines are delish , the crowd is hip , and the food is yum . the only reason i did n't give it 5 stars is solely because there 's practically no
0 oh yeah , this place absolutely blows . i 'll enter in a new reason -lrb- though all mentioned are perfectly valid -rrb- : limited <unk> <unk> selections in the movie department . <unk> !
2 i agree with generally everyone : hummus , good . drink prices and ingredients , confusing . waitresses , awful . potential , there . music , awesome .
3 first : how the hell do you yelpers remember every damned dish you ate ? i have a problem remembering whether or not i wore shoes yesterday , much less the contents of my stomach . me , short bus ; you , memory genius ? i do n't know
4 we went here for breakfast , and while the wait time was unbearable , i chalk it up to cranky hangover <unk> . the orange juice was awesome ! other notable features are how clean and comfortable the place is , the sheer deliciousness of the food , and the
2 i 'll always come here when in town but it 's only for the guacamole . it 's ridiculously good ! that said , the service is always terrible . forgetful sometimes , but irritated and rude always . i come to phoenix 3 or 4 times a year and
2 stopped by for a quick lunch today ... it has been a couple of years since my last visit , but everything seemed pretty much the same . we had the fish tacos -lrb- <unk> salmon -rrb- and a shrimp tempura roll . the tacos were pretty yummy , although
3 oh , herb box ... i have been dreaming about you . your yogurt <unk> is so delectable , that i have visions of swimming in giant pools of your yogurt , rolling around in your homemade granola , and getting drizzled with your <unk> honey . hmmm . on
3 i 've been here about a million times over the past few years , but somehow never thought to write a review . i really dig pei wei . it is so much fresher tasting than typical chinese take-out , and it is my go-to do n't - <unk> place
3 ticoz - you are near and dear to my <unk> heart . i love your endless supply of fruity , delicious and strong drinks . i 've actually had to <unk> a driver just to have half of a mojito ! your bar service has always been top-notch , and
3 i 'm very glad that i gave zinburger a second chance ... they have certainly redeemed themselves . on our first visit -lrb- with the 4-year-old , mind you -rrb- , we were told the wait was 5-10 minutes ... 25 minutes later , we were finally sat ... with
4 what an absolutely perfect and adorable collection of local gems ! the concept is fantastic - i love the `` mini '' versions of some of my favorite places . my favorite ? the british bicycle company . those are the most insanely beautiful bikes that i have ever seen
2 i headed to ra for a happy hour with a couple of friends last week . we sat outside and were quite comfortable , thanks to the well placed heaters . our server was nice enough , but not very engaging . we really enjoyed the pineapple cream cheese wontons
2 i strayed from my usual coffee bar , luci 's , to try out urban beans because i had a groupon burning a hole in my pocket . my sister and i ordered a caramel toffee nut mocha , iced green <unk> combo , and a slice of quiche .
4 after a few hours of walking around downtown taking photos , i needed a place to cool off . busted out my handy yelp app and found this lovely place . the atmosphere and vibe were great . very relaxing atmosphere with some people reading , doing laptop work or
4 if you 're looking for a great appetizer , definitely get the pretzel and cheese fondue . so good and it 's a good amount to share ! i have n't been let down by the food here . everything from the pub burger , to the chicken curry is
2 you know , i 'm going to keep this simple . if you 're looking for a good selection of beer on draft , go here . if you 're looking for beer and food , look for other options . came here at lunch time with some co-workers and
3 this place is definitely worth checking out . tonight they had a great dj who was playing some fantastic music . i 've been twice and enjoyed myself both times . as far as the food is concerned , try anything that interests you . the hot and sour soup
3 this is my new favorite place to eat . no kidding ! i only gave it 4 stars -lrb- although i would like to give a 4.5 -rrb- because the martini 's are a little ... ummm ... not quite up to par . if only the bartender would go
3 i love fez . first off , their sweet potato fries are really very good . also , they give you this <unk> stuff to dip them in , super sweet , but i 've got a serious sweet tooth , so that 's right up my alley . i
4 one of the best places to eat and get a drink . do n't miss the pozole . also , just in case you 're wondering , there is n't anything on the menu that you will regret ordering .
3 when i used to work across the street at st. joe 's , pino 's was the ultimate <unk> comfort food . their greek salad is humongous and amazing , with <unk> of flavor from kalamata olives and feta . it 's yummy with shredded pizza mozzarella on top too
1 rip taylor 's ! somehow our friendly neighborhood breakfast spot <unk> overnight into `` the daily bistro '' . gone is the impeccable service , unassuming but expansive menu , and outstanding food . now we have a <unk> , <unk> menu , spotty service , and incorrectly cooked food
1 ok , it 's a travesty to not like this place . i get it . the concept of tapas is fabulous for <unk> like myself , and i would be all over it if there was n't a single thing on the menu not involving the flesh of dead
3 i totally forgot about merc until the other night when my companion and i required additional alcoholic beverages after the bottle of wine we 'd inhaled at true foods . quite an improvement since the days when we 'd run across camelback in heels , hoping a <unk> drunk was
3 maybe the postino 's <unk> is dying down a little bit , because my so and i were able to get a seat on the chic patio on a gorgeous saturday night without effort . my so was happy because he was able to sit and admire his <unk> ride
0 oregano 's , you are <unk> , and i am baffled by your crowds of followers who seem willing to <unk> about in 115 degree heat for over an hour for you . everything tastes as if someone had an accident with the salt shaker in the kitchen . bland
3 and , my dear friends , that 's four stars based on <unk> alone -- i can imagine , when accompanied by the legendary array of british beers , this will easily make the coveted five star mark . yummy , greasy , down-home comfort food goodness ... and enough
1 kitschy name , cute concept , a little indie place in an area consumed by <unk> chains -- oink really had all the potential in the world . the space is simple , open , and clean , although very sparse -- what some may interpret as modern simply <unk>
1 yay : good location -- close to me and easy to get to . yay : free reliable wifi . meh : the coffee . not falling over good , but not burnt up , <unk> starbucks style either . meh : the food . now , granted , i
3 solid three and a half stars , rounded up because i am feeling <unk> today . others have already <unk> <unk> about the high points of this little hidden gem : the decor -lrb- slightly kitschy , somewhat modern and a pinch of rustic -rrb- , the salsa bar -lrb-
1 my favorite middle eastern restaurant in all of eternity is haji baba in tempe . is it any wonder , then , why i am so <unk> underwhelmed by mbfgr ? if you want a real hamburger , you do n't go to denny 's , you go to chuck
2 five stars for the view , four stars for the drinks , three stars for the food , and two stars for the service . the view at jade was spectacular and can not be rivaled . nestled in camelback mountain , overlooking <unk> mountain , this view has got
4 noca is the epitome of a strip mall gem . from the outside , it looks like a bonafide hole in the wall . nothing flashy , just another storefront next to the safeway . however , once you walk inside , you are immediately whisked away to a world
2 the husband and i stopped here one night to satisfy a fro-yo craving . it was alright . we used to frequent yogurtini in tempe , and mojo just does n't add up . the fruit toppings were all canned fruit , there were no syrups and the other <unk>
2 i live nearby but have only eaten here a few times . they recently made the transition to a full-service restaurant , but i must say , i preferred the convenience of ordering at the counter . i also miss the chips and salsa bar ! the food is decent
0 they use hydrogenated oils by the truck load , nothing more to say but i will go on . the food is eh and the portions are huge . is it really necessary to add a billion <unk> of fat in everything , especially genetically modified oils that are completely
1 ok here is the thing , i went back another time and it was good . about a month later we came late with our roomie . it was bar service only since it was late . the bartender a middle aged over weight red haired guy went to get
4 this is most definetly the best restaurant in all of az !!! for one , they do not use any preservatives or hydrogenated oil . if you are someone that <unk> to eat that garbage that is banned in multiple countries than you dont know how hard it is to
3 this place is awesome !!! i found a new hang out yay !!! so the happy hour is really really good . here 's what i got kettle of pork <unk> 's with melted jack cheese and <unk> flour tortillas 7.00 !! = this pork literally melts in your mouth
4 by far the best ice cream and desserts ever !!!! i live next door . blessing , or curse ? any way the waffle cones are off the chain , and everything is made there . the caramel , the brownies , the cones , everything is made there .
1 i give it 2 stars and ill tell you why . i would give it <unk> for the interior . i like what they have going on , but it does make you expect something different . they also have a great menu selection at really good prices . i
2 ok so i got a salt bagel and cream cheese . the salt bagel was wayyy too salty . . i know i know its a salt bagel , but seriously it was beyond salty and i couldnt brush some of it off . which i generally can it was
4 i really have nothing new to add , everything is really really great . the new menu is wonderful the desserts are great . i have yet to have something bad to say . . accept they dont have one in la
1 i really enjoy the atmosphere however the food is worse than a microwave dinner . i think the buy bing bags of <unk> from costco !! we got there and they didnt seat us for <unk> . when there were tables . then we got seated and didnt get the
2 ok so before you go here just be warned that the parking lot is a mess ! worst parking lot in az -lrb- and there are some bad ones -rrb- . also beware that you will wait long for your food -lrb- think 45 <unk> hour -rrb- . having said
3 i got ta hand it to spinatos . when i first came here the service was abysmal , but lately they have really stepped up their game . this place does a great job lately at being accommodating to customers and of course as always bringing out delicious food .
4 my boyfriend took me to house of tricks the weekend after valentine 's day for lunch . we had heard there was a wait so we got there early which was really nice because there was no wait and barely anyone there . their menu is full of delicious food
4 this place has awesome hot dogs ! they are thick and juicy on a delicious warm bun . the fries are pretty great too . be warned that there is a wait here , but it goes pretty quickly and there is a reason why people line up for these
4 had an amazing time seeing <unk> lamar and <unk> west here on tuesday . it was my first time at us airways center and i will definitely be back if any other artist i enjoy comes to perform . i used the park and ride on washington just a few
4 oh my goodness ! yelp has smiled upon my taste buds once again . i searched for lunch in this area while my boyfriend and i were waiting on our car and we walked up to habanero 's just in time . after we put in our order all these

3 my boyfriend 's family is from chicago and coincidentally his name is also al , short for <unk> we spotted this place yesterday coming back from shopping and put it on our to do list . it just so happened we had to drive near the area again earlier today
4 love lux ! fresh juice , coffee roasted on site , a variety of pastries made fresh daily . urban scene , great music , cool art . perfect for morning , afternoon and evening ! katie <unk> up some of the best pastries and lunches in town . and
4 my office is close , so i stop in about once a month . the number 1 item bringing me in is the macaroons . heavenly macaroons . i 've traveled all over nyc , and still have n't found ones that compare to essence bakery 's version - so
4 i love the fact that the menu is constantly changing . if you 've been before , you need to return , because there is always something new and tasty to try ! i was back in again , and happy to report that the cuisine was still stellar .
4 yay ! i 'm so happy to see my neighborhood staple get the love it deserves ! the food here is amazing ! as an upscale deli counter , they have everything from deserts , to a cheese stand , to prepared foods to go . d'licious dishes has <unk>
3 love the concept ! i 've been to the duce a number of times for get <unk> . huge eclectic space , awesome comfort food -lrb- features on diners , dives and drive in -rrb- <unk> out from an <unk> trailer , and hand crafted prohibition era cocktails . while
3 lulu 's is n't cheap . now that i got that out of the way let me say that i love lulu 's chicken enchiladas . love . no , the tortillas are not homemade . no , there is n't anything else on the menu that is exceptional .
3 happy hour is why this place exists in my mind or on any list with four stars . free food paired with spendy but stiff martinis is n't a bad thing . great ambiance . sultry and <unk> lit . modern . this is a good place for happy hour
2 location faces west -lrb- faces hayden rd. right before it <unk> frank lloyd wright -rrb- . modest looking bar with great craft beer on tap , including seasonals that rotate fairly often and cask ale always available on tap . food and prices are reasonable , but nothing spectacular .
3 mellow mushroom is finally in phoenix . they 're up on happy valley rd. on the ne corner of i-17 and happy valley , in that norterra shopping area . it faces happy valley , so it 's easy to find . their specialty is pizza with fresh & premium
2 winter has the shortest days of the year . the shortest days of the year here have some of the best weather . so , this location in the country has some of its best days as its shortest days - how sad is that ? it 's like finding
2 no <unk> to the salsa , including the `` hot '' one that the server said was an habanero salsa . this was an enormous disappointment because though i can understand making the standard salsa incredibly mild because of the general public , if they 're going to make a
3 east coast breakfasts served up here , in more ways than one . there are a few southern breakfast items , but largely this is where you go for your 2 eggs , hashbrowns , and choice of meat . modest , casual atmosphere that screams diner to you ,
0 this is probably the worst oreganos location for parking . back in the 1990 's they just had the one small building with a handful of spots , and everyone else was forced onto find a spot outside on one of the busiest streets in scottsdale -lrb- scottsdale rd. -rrb-
0 <unk> . like cattle , we line up to go through the line and get on the plane . in the past , there was <unk> and <unk> of teeth to see who could be at the front of the ` a ' line , and then a senior citizen
3 good location and broad range of choices on the buffett . service was adequate , price was n't too bad , and a few of the buffett items were quite good . only downsides i 've experienced are the occasional use of french fries on the buffett as `` vegetable
3 fried cheese ravioli were divine . plenty of yummy cheese on the inside -lrb- ricotta if not others as well -rrb- , golden brown <unk> , and thick shavings of fresh parmesan garnished on top . marinara on the side . wow . pizza was good but not great .
1 consistently horrible service . food is very good . i used to <unk> corporate chains and opt for local offerings , but babbo changed my mind . they seem to hire servers who have little to no experience as servers , and frankly have no idea how to provide good
1 dumpy dive bar with <unk> bar prices . wtf ? scary location & parking , broken glass everywhere , homeless guy out front begging for spare change , graffiti in bathrooms , etc. . beer selection nothing to get excited about either .
3 generous , tasty portions of rather healthy cuisine are just what this part of the valley needs . a nice assortment of hummus flavors are available -lrb- cilantro is a real treat -rrb- , along with numerous mediterranean favorites . i 'm rather simple so i went for the falafel
3 reliably good food and reasonably priced considering location , atmosphere , and quality of food . i got into maggiano 's from when i lived in the chicago area -lrb- their location downtown there -rrb- , and i 'm glad they have one here . entrees are priced a few
2 truly do n't appreciate the pathetic tease they have by naming this place with initials , yet refusing to tell us what they actually mean . if there is n't a clear meaning , then you 're lame for having a name like this . please , drop the act
2 caveat <unk> here . lot of similar or maybe identical products to stuff at discount places -lrb- target , home depot , etc. -rrb- but this place charges big bucks for some rather simple stuff . even if not found elsewhere , it seems like the items here are really
3 good sandwiches and atypical food items on the menu , with a good selection of craft beer . music is not to my taste , but it 's part of their stated theme so i guess i ca n't fault them for that . cool atmosphere with the old house
1 good atmosphere , average food , but a lot to worry about as far as menu & other policies is concerned . food is consistent , bread is above average , and prices are within normal range for phoenix . why are the traditional appetizers available only on saturday and
3 good food , good service and good atmosphere ... just tastes like <unk> food , so could n't give a 5th star .
3 excellent happy hour <unk> , great food , cool patio setting next to the bar and the private rooms downstairs are great for business meetings . this would be a 5 * , but the parking is n't very easy to deal with . highly recommended though !
4 ordered delivery and it <unk> amazing as soon as it arrived at the front door and tasted even better ... very , very good pizza !
3 loved the mood , atmosphere , service and the food was very tasty . try the pork belly and butternut squash for apps , followed by the juicy filet mignon .
4 i 'm sold ... i 'm smitten ... i 'm all in ... i 'm coming back for more ... i 'm blown away ... i 'm debating a return for dinner tomorrow night . ambiance = b + atmosphere = a <unk> = a - food = a +
2 i was pretty shocked to learn that my pasta dish contained over 2000 calories . other than that , the pasta was nothing to rejoice about . could n't end a night at the cheesecake factory without a slice of cheesecake !
3 i was so excited to find out that there is a wbc here in glendale because i had gone to the wbc in sedona with my boyfriend and literally ate every breakfast there . it 's nice to come here for breakfast and just stay here for hours studying before
3 what is the happiest time ? why it 's the happy time that good restaurants sell good eats at half price !!! happy hour ! -lrb- one of my favorite phrases , right up there with `` swim up bar '' and `` caviar bar '' -rrb- . happy hour
3 sadly , i had to put my handsome son <unk> and his lovely wife sarah on a plane back to san jose ... the visit was done ... they needed to get back to their real life and quit hanging out with the old man . but , before they

3 this place has great food ! the menu is so long -- you 'll spend a good 10 min at least just going through all the pages , and you 'd only be skimming . i was with a large group of people , and half the table ordered the

4 delicious , cheap , and campy . great chips . campy atmosphere , everything was perfect !
4 i love the spicy noodle dish here and the servers are so sweet . the thai tea is also to die for . i ca n't not love something with sweetened condensed milk .
2 meh . met up with a few friends here and sat on the patio on a saturday night around 8 . there are no heaters , which would be ok if it was a nice fall day or a summer night , but i was a bit cold towards the

2 i really really wanted to love this place , as i love all things postino and windsor , but after two trips i ca n't really say more than it was just a-ok . there was nothing particularly bad at all , but nothing really jumped out at me and

3 this place is too inconvenient to get to during the weekdays b/c i 'm sure i 'd enjoy it much better . gets pretty crowded on the weekends , but i enjoy the music and the scottsdale scene always <unk> me .
2 the non-fat mocha i had was just <unk> ' t taste the <unk> . a lot of people pass through making it good for people watching , but tables are too close together to be comfortable .
2 i 've tried practically everything on this menu , and it 's a solid restaurant . nothing fancy , not too expensive , just good food . however , the service is slow and the tap water is terrible . i particularly recommend : the <unk> tofu the tempura shrimp
4 this is a good place to catch a movie . most first run movies get here . as pointed out by another , some films from camelview 5 end up here . ticket sales is efficient , ticket taker nice and efficient , concessions efficient , clean and pleasant place
4 i do n't care to shop but even i can tell this is a remarkable mall . it has many major chains . it has all necessary amenities . it has a lot of parking , much of it shaded . if you want to shop high end scottsdale this
4 we like coming here . we are n't the ideal patrons as we do n't gamble much . the orange sky is a great restaurant . you need to be prepared to pay but it is worth it if your budget allows : great martinis , excellent wine list ,
3 we mostly go for happy hour . it has a good one . last visit i was the only person at the table of four who exclusively consumed happy hour fare . i love the slider plate . it is three little burgers in different styles . others had sandwiches
3 went here to meet a good friend . this is one that really should be 31/2 stars but they were very nice so i 'll add the half . i liked this place alot . they have a good deal as well as i my sushi came with edamame ,
4 mmmmmmmm ... i friggin love this place . the greatest damm subs in the whole world . straight from nj . i moved here about 4 years ago from nj and missed this place so damm bad . it is a little overpriced , but the fresh ingrediants are so
2 i would really give this like a 21/2 but its all good . there is nothing wrong with this place at all . went with a bunch of friends we had a good time as we danced until closing . the problem is it is just well ... eh .
4 some times you go to a place and it is so awesome you have to find your computer and yelp about it right away . well . . this is one of those times . went there today and had a pizza with sausage and onion . the <unk> is
3 so ... yelp led me to this place . i was bored and craving mexican so i took a ride down town . really classy place . a lot of time was placed into the decor and i liked the vibe . went for lunch and the place is big
4 yeah i have written reviews about grimaldi 's ... still the best . my favorite pizza of all time . best antipasto -lrb- spell check maybe much ? -rrb- i have ever had . love it . love it . love it .
0 this place is douchebag central . you go in and <unk> you are not dressed like a <unk> then you are ignored or <unk> from a distance . i heard there is a room in the back for after hours sex acts but that may be a pseudo rumor the
3 we prefer this location for our movie enjoyment . and as you know harkins has great deals with their drink cups and <unk> . clean , convenient good restaurants around .
3 yum !! this place has some `` smokin ' '' bbq : -rrb- seriously thou ... the bbq was very good , tender and tasty . i had the st. louis ribs -lrb- dry -rrb- and the bbq tri-tip and was very happy with the meal . the biscuits and

4 very cute local art boutique with tons of interesting artsy creations . i really enjoyed walking through the store and looking at everything . so many great ideas , and cool crafts to buy for decorating or <unk> . i loved the vibe of the location , which is surrounded
3 met my whole family of 11 people here for brunch on a sunday . we got in pretty quick and were led to our table . as you can imagine , with so many people , someone was n't happy with the choice of our table and so we ended
3 they had happy hour when we went , which was a plus . we ordered a couple of rolls from the happy hour menu -lrb- red tiger roll and the volcano roll -rrb- and the chicken <unk> . they were all good , no complaints there . beer was cheap
2 always one of my favorites , ca n't go wrong with the chicken <unk> -lrb- my favorite dish there -rrb- . the chili was great too . one of the only places that no matter how full i am it is a must to get dessert .
4 i just threw a birthday bash for my boyfriend ! and we had great service and a great time ! they did a great job in accommodating our large group of 20 people in their vip area and imagine all separate checks too and still no mix ups ! we
3 they have the best garlic fries , but i was actually impressed with their cajun style pasta , i did not expect it to be so delicious ! nice beer selection and even on a busy fri night , not a long wait for a seat . definitely a great
2 fun happy hour place ! good appetizer selection ! great beers ! funny bartenders !
3 this is a great place to take your relatives visiting from the midwest ! it 's also a great place to grab a beer after hiking pinnacle peak if you are a local . this is n't a destination for schmancy food -- it 's a great hole in the
2 meh ... i had high expectations for this joint and it sadly did n't cut the mustard . the staff was very friendly and accommodating to our party , who had changed the reservation size twice and showed up late -lrb- oops ! we accidentally went to the scottsdale quarter
4 wow . this places is incredible . i can honestly say that everything on the menu is wonderful . it 's the perfect date place , since you can order booze to cure the date jitters . also , you can satisfy your dieting girlfriend and still order a big
3 really liked this bar . the bartender told me the owners had changed , and i could kind of tell the difference from when i had gone before . the decor and atmosphere is really neat . there is a huge tree with a bar surrounding it and various tables
2 pretty cool bar ! the vibe is pretty laid back . its a small ` house ' like bar that does beer and wine . i almost passed this place up when walking by . its surrounded by other low key coffee <unk> gallery type <unk> . when we went
4 this is a fabulous place to go for brunch . upon arriving , we felt we were someplace other than phoenix ! the views of the mountains and foliage were great . there 's so much room to spread out on the picnic tables and around the lawn . i
4 this place is a little expensive but its worth it for the wide and inventive selection of ice creams and sorbets . everything here tastes so fresh with the flavors just jumping out ! i love going back just to try their new flavors . their ice-cream sandwiches are also
3 this is kind of a tucked away cafe surrounded by a busy ice rink and health club . it 's an odd location for sure , but closer to my house than the one in arcadia . we came here just before 1pm on a saturday afternoon . we mistakenly
3 great beer , awesome live music on fridays , good variety of beer , and good atmosphere . this place is a great place to come in cityscape -lrb- downtown phoenix -rrb- it seems packed every time we go there and is always a fun place . the live music

1 most over-hyped pizza in town . very crunchy , <unk> crust that was covered in black <unk> or some kind of crap that looked identical to black <unk> . sauce that was too sweet and cheese that was <unk> call me picky , but i like cheese on my pizza
4 head up the north side if you want your ass kicked , head up the east side for something more mellow . either way you 're in for a great hike and the best view in the valley .
2 i 'm a bit picky about thai . maybe that 's why i 'm so hard on malee 's . it 's not traditional thai . which is not necessarily bad if you do n't know the difference or just do n't care . the food here is decent .
1 uhhh , i think my neighbor is on crack . he said , `` julio g 's is the best ! ... blah blah blah ... the food is so good ... blah blah blah '' when he should have said , `` dude , stay the hell away from

4 wow . this place is amazing . we went early friday night and each got 4 courses with wine pairings . you get a small menu with a list of proteins . you mark off what you do n't want to try and list any dislikes or allergies . you

3 stayed here nye 2007 . our room was large and i loved the bright colors and funky decor . but the big bathtub was the best part . i needed to soak for awhile after a long night of partying . the bed was really comfortable too , but i
3 i found the staff here to be very friendly . one of my favorite things to do is just lounge around and drink a glass of wine . i love to try new stuff and our waitress was so helpful in making a great suggestion for me and my boyfriend
3 my prom date brought me here 10 years ago . hmm ... i wonder what he was expecting at the end of the night . although he thought that tanning until he was as red as a lobster was the new black this was one of his better judgment calls
3 wow . there is a lot of stuff here to try . yea ! olive oils , balsamic <unk> , <unk> . the tour is not really for little kids . you sit outside where all the benches are for half of it and listen to the guide talk about

3 the restaurant is located on the fifth floor of the phoenician . you can valet your car and take elevator c or d up to the restaurant . we got a table where both of us were seated looking out the window . although it may make for an early
4 we love bliss ! please eat here so it stays open forever !!! maybe it 's the fact that downtown phoenix is a ghost town after 5 p.m. -lrb- unless there 's a sporting event or concert -rrb- but every time we go to bliss , which is often ,
3 in the past , i avoided this place because it is located in a strip mall . so how good can it be ? i should have listened to my mom when she told me not to judge a book by its cover . i 've now been here three
2 this place is a fun spot to be seen , but if you 're looking for cheap happy hour drinks you should go elsewhere . they offer a full bar so if you do n't want to pay $ 10 for one of their specialty drinks you can order a
4 i am a boba tea enthusiast ! this is the best place that i have found in the phoenix area . the prices are about average and the tea was not too sweet . the boba is the best ! i think it is the one made from taro root

4 pita jungle in gilbert has been our go-to lunch spot in the area for the last couple of years . it 's always packed whenever we go , and the laidback hipster servers are always friendly , on point , and attentive in their own ways . their menu has
3 the food and service has always been consistently good here . love the open air bar . the fries here are really good . never had anything i didnt like . especially love the ahi sliders and the chocolate lava cake . one of the best is the strawberry salad

2 the menu is exactly the same as the one in kierland but i like the other restaurant better . it 's always fun to be in old town and ra sushi is probably the best sushi i know of in phoenix area but this restaurant in much smaller and also
3 of the 3 locations oddly this one seems to be the busiest . still excellent pizza . highly recommend for dining in or taking out . great salads too . love everything about this place . anyone who says there is no good pizza in scottsdale has never been to

3 nice place . they had a great guitar player that we listened to while having a drink for my wife 's birthday .

2 the food in general is not terrible , but <unk> seems to be a problem for this spot . case in point : i have added meatballs to my pasta , i have added sausage to my pasta . both were lukewarm on the outside , icy on the inside

2 `` this will be the longest you 've ever waited for a mediocre cup of coffee . '' kind of the best way to put it . a place with the <unk> `` coffee '' in their name is expected to serve excellent coffee , at least in the books

3 love the crab cake -- for sure the best in the valley ! ca n't wait to go back ...
3 chino bandido is my guilty pleasure . it is utterly unhealthy food served in an aluminum foil bowl , delivered by a casually dressed employee who <unk> your name until you claim it . and , you get a soft snickerdoodle cookie , as if there were not enough calories
1 i do n't get what people like about this place . it 's generally crowded with rushed service and the food has yet to impress . i 've tried at least twice -- maybe i 'm ordering wrong but i really just do n't get it ...

3 i really like the reverse happy hour here . minus 1 star because i was slightly disappointed with their pretzels . i thought they were a little overcooked and not doughy enough . the beer cheddar sauce was worth the extra money .

2 solid three stars with room for improvement . love the atmosphere ! they converted the house into a restaurant in <unk> , and it has a small town charm . the chicken fried steak was tasty , but the cook forgot my biscuits and the hash brown portion was a
4 four peaks ! yum ! get a burger . the beer battered fries are delicious . i love the atmosphere . totally laid back . i do n't drink beer , but the brewery is pretty cool . my husband is a beer drinker and he likes the 8th st
4 i love the coffee shop !!! it 's the greatest for breakfast . i always get the papas grande breakfast burrito with extra salsa . the salsa is so fresh and sweet . delicious ! they serve breakfast until 11 a.m. lunch is good too . i like the turkey
3 yeah ! joe 's farm grill !!! i like smaller portions , so the kids meal is perfect for me . i get the chicken strips , which come with french fries . my husband likes the fontina burger and sweet potato fries . the drink and condiment station outside
4 mmmm ... ! delicioso ! this place is a local gem . the restaurant is n't known for the atmosphere , but for the good food ! it 's in the ghetto , but the food is cheap and delicious . i always get the tostada , but the butter
2 we went for lunch and had the following : - sashimi appetizer - calamari - caterpillar role - spicy salmon dynamite the sashimi was yummy , but the rolls were mediocre . the prices were a little high , but the staff was super friendly . i give it a
2 went to rose and crown with the <unk> pub crawl . nice place . a bit cramped in the front <unk> area , but once you get into the back rooms , it opens up a bit . i only had drinks , but the prices were quite reasonable .
3 i had a chorizo and egg burrito , my friend had a carne asada burrito , and i had a medium drink , and it was all less than $ 10 . that alone makes me like this place . the fact that the burrito was pretty good sized ,
2 joined <unk> and <unk> for lunch today . i was excited to try dillon 's as it is close to my house , and i love good bbq . i 'm sad to say i was less than thrilled . we ordered hot wings . what we got were 12
4 had the <unk> passion , and was <unk> impressed . the salad bar was nice and fresh , and well stocked . the london broiled was tender and delicious , the au jus was very savory . i had a wonderful time , and would love to return .
4 sierra was my bartender , and later , jessica , both gracious , and attentive . had the <unk> <unk> nachos , and a few pacific <unk> <unk> . enjoyed a nascar race , and some good conversation . love this establishment , and will be back again , and
1 had the lunch pollo con queso special . the chicken was pretty dry , and had no <unk> flavor . the jalapeo cheese they topped it with was n't very spicy , but was ok . our server was good , and they have decent salsa with their chips .
2 tuck shop is in a lovely neighborhood , and sits across the street from the musicians union . the exterior architecture is nice , but not worthy of mention . the interior , however , is absolutely wonderful . the ceiling is really amazing . the furniture is eclectic and
3 pretty good food for a decent price . i had a <unk> for $ 16 , and was able to feed two people with it . their salsa selection is pretty good , too .
3 used my <unk> <unk> today . jasmine was our server , and was also <unk> bar . she was quite distracted . i do n't think it was entirely her fault , but the service was less than what i would have expected . mom had a cheese crisp with
3 dropped in to <unk> with <unk> and <unk> , and i 'm very glad i did . i 've been meaning to get down to visit , but since i do n't live in downtown , it 's not easy . i had a georgia peach tea , which was
3 i was surprised when i walked in ; i had the impression from the exterior that the place was much smaller , and i expected only a counter , and perhaps a few tables . pleasant surprise to be seated , with a waitress to attend . the menu alone
4 i met monsieur here for lunch today and i was so impressed with the new look . i 've always loved houston 's -lrb- now known as hillstone 's -rrb- and the food , service and decor have always been impeccable . the only drawback with the new location is
4 during another phx visit , i took friend here for a romantic dinner out . as always , bar bianco and pizzeria bianco did n't disappoint . this time , we did half a wiseguy and half a biancoverde . why the hell did n't we ever think to do
3 so the other day , i was in the mood for sushi at my usual spot -lrb- sakana -rrb- . unfortunately , they were closed for lunch , so the next choice was some pasta at caffe boa next door . also closed for lunch . double shit !! pasta
2 my friend and i attended the pre grand opening and were greeted by a friendly staff . our waitress was fantastic -lrb- <unk> -rrb- . we had the salmon appetizer with sliced tomatoes , onions , egg , and crispy crunchy bread . i had the rainbow trout which was
0 2nd attempt at this place . the only reason we did go back is that we had a gift certificate -lrb- which is now useless -rrb- . <unk> the disappointment a few weeks back we decided fo call to be sure they had a cook on duty and we could
3 today was my 3rd time here . went to lunch with a group of friends . the place is not much on atmosphere and decor but the food is good and priced great . i had a bowl of beef stew with rice noodles and of course could only finish
4 two more trips since my last review and i still stand at 5 stars . both times were with groups of friends . on one of my ventures here i was with a group who decided to try the family style . we had 2 fish dinners -lrb- <unk> &

3 went there for the first time . i shared a crab cake sandwich , which was ok , and a reuben sandwich , which was very good . also shared a side of okra and mac and cheese , which i could n't get enough of . the atmosphere is
3 i go here for the excellent white pizza , cheap beer , and great conversation with the bartenders . i live just across the street so it 's nice to put away the beer and not worry about driving home .
2 it 's not the best korean in town , but it 's the closest for me . it 's good not wow !
3 it 's good . i like pho . the prices are not that bad . good portion size , but no huge .
3 good casual food , the tuna is good .
3 this place is good . it 's little high price , but it was good thai food . i wish the portion size was bigger .
3 it was good . cozy , nice place . if you are in the mood to try something different . then this is a good place to start .
3 hipster central . i think the <unk> of limitations has passed so i can confess that i once got drunk with some of these hipsters and * may * of taken home one of the ubiquitous <unk> littering the place . i enjoy the <unk> where they have adult disneyland
3 bright , no nonsense chinese and vietnamese restaurant . you can get a good mix of both styles of food . this is <unk> of many chinese cafes you would get in hong kong . i sometimes wished they had more cantonese styled dishes , but the pho is good
3 great place for a group of friends to share a bunch of sushi and sake . came here for a birthday party and they were so accomodating allowing us to push together several tables . they have a good sake selection -lrb- both warm and cold -rrb- . the sushi
1 finally finally went after all these years and all the hype . met some friends for happy hour . the pros : cheap beer . beer is 2 for 1 , which amounts to 2.50 cents per <unk> . having said that , ate off the happy hour menu .
3 one of the best kept cheap beer places . during happy hour , decent suds are 2.50 a pint . delicious and economical ! the patio is a great hang out spot . the interior is hard if you are group . mostly two tops . food is pretty solid
2 little charming caf . the staff is super busy and so you might feel a little <unk> as diners stare at you and your table in envy . the menu is straight forward and contains quality ingredients . what would have pushed it over to 4 star territory would have
3 is it wrong to <unk> guacamole at odd hours ? i almost always order guacamole -lrb- which somehow always tastes better than my own -rrb- and a 1/2 salad 1/2 torta combo . usually the <unk> salad but they have a new one with pomegranate seeds and blue cheese .
3 the original hoity toity burger place . smallish portions but the burger is so good ! quality protein done well . good french fries -lrb- you can do a mix with sweet potato if you like -rrb- . shakes are thick and good . i know that folks are n't
3 went back recently and had food that was much much better than my first experience . maybe i ordered better , maybe it was the company , but this time i left happy and satisfied . the bread comes piping hot and fresh and you can dip it in a
2 typical sam fox . good , but nothing i 'd scream and rave about . solid comfort food , a little on the heavy side for my taste . the menu has been through a few changes . the salads are good , -lrb- although the salmon one is not
3 no nonsense coffee place with a simple chalk board with the types of coffee and the ways they will prepare it . not a huge selection of baked goods . you get the sense that the <unk> are a little <unk> and a little wary of corporate folks who want
4 ignore the fact that it is in a strip mall . -lrb- you live in az , everything is in a strip mall -rrb- . inside is a magical land of japanese food unlike most in town . it is not limited to sushi , there are robata style nibbles
2 finally able to try windsor after hearing about it for ages . this place apparently is the new hip place to be seen at it . it is almost directly across the street from arcadia central . the same folks that frequent that spot probably run across the street to
3 come hungry . the plates are big and full of tasty goodness . i like to share with friends if possible . the food is spicy but not so spicy that i find it overwhelming . most items comes drizzled with a bit of crema which makes me happy .
3 great lunch buffet , for the price , you get a ton of different types of food to try . the naan is great and piping hot . i will say that their chicken <unk> masala is not my favorite but overall for the ambiance , this place is super
3 the parking is horrific . -lrb- it 's in the same structure as luci 's and a cupcake store -rrb- . however , brave the parking situation since this is a much needed local non-chain addition to the neighborhood . without <unk> zipps across the street , -lrb- i mean
3 if you get a hankering for a quick , delicious -lrb- and unhealthy -rrb- burger fix , you have to go to smashburger . since the burger craze started , there have been an <unk> of burger joints all claiming to be the best burger in town . i think
2 i really really wanted to like this place . the menu looks delicious , it promises to be healthy -lrb- nothing over 500 calories -rrb- and it looks beautiful . i 'll start with the positives . the place is packed , -lrb- which is generally a good sign for
3 one of my favorite destinations for everything <unk> . more variety of dried goods and fresh products than the other markets . conveniently located next to dimsum at phoenix palace and vietnamese restaurants . lees sandwiches is also across the street . they even have an asian <unk> located inside
2 like it but kinda miss the old sonoran brew pub that used to be here . solid pub food . it is a good pick when rosie 's is just too crowded and you want a place that is a -lrb- little -rrb- quieter . the back patio is great
3 great seafood tower and creme brulee . oh yeah the steaks are good too . what i like about this place is that they take the time to learn your name and are attentive without being overly intrusive . if you have to impress a small business group you can
3 yummy mom and pop place . excellent ceviche and i love ordering the molcajete . it comes bubbling and filled to the brim with seafood goodies served in a <unk> rock container . the chips could use a little work , but with all the plentiful <unk> that come on
2 the place is much too loud for my taste . not that the music is n't good , it just gets in the way of good conversation . if you live close by , get take out . the pizza will still be good -lrb- the potato is by far
3 joe 's farm grill was featured on diners , drive-in 's , and dives . joe 's is a very unique place and a must visit if you live in the phoenix area . joe 's farm grill is located on a farm and many of the items on the
2 in my opinion , china king is just an average chinese restaurant . the dim sum is good , but i 'd give the edge to c-fu . i 've been a couple of times and the service was sub-par both times . not a bad dining experience , but
3 haus murphy 's was featured on diners , drive-in 's , and dives . i 'll start out by saying that my favorite thing about haus murphy 's is the originality of the place . i 've never been to germany , but it felt like what i imagine germany
2 dos gringos is a great place to go for a chill happy hour . although the food and service is just average , they do have good drink specials . corona 's are $ 2.50 every day and they have other daily specials that are pretty sweet . dos has
3 santisi brothers is a sports bar in west phoenix . i would describe santisi 's as a typical sports bar except for the fact that they have a ton of tv 's , which is handy for football sunday 's . the menu has an emphasis on italian cuisine and
3 the food here is pretty good . i enjoy drinking outside . a lot of hipsters hang out here . get over it . it 's tempe
0 ew . i wish i could give zero stars , but then i would n't be able to complain about how awful this place is . worst paradise bakery , ever . ever . i 'm surprised i did n't get food <unk> eating here . my sandwich -lrb- chicken
3 this review <unk> on the 3-4 star range , so i 'll just go with four . the pizza was alright . the crust was good , but like other yelpers have said , a little too soggy in the middle . i also was n't digging the ricotta cheese
3 amazing . the cheese steak is the cats pajamas . the chicken parm sandwich is heavenly . i would like to try other items , but i can not stray from my usual as they are too delicious . would be five stars if their service was a teensy bit
2 carly 's is a solid 3 start joint . most of the food here i can easily make at home . the feta rosa is really really delicious though . the live music here can be a little much sometimes . especially when it 's 5 pm on a monday
2 i 'm not sure if i would come back . we went to the duce around 7:45 pm and parking was hard to come by . maybe i 'm too cheap to do valet but we had to hoof it cause something was going on downtown because the side streets
4 it took me awhile to actually find this place . but it was well worth the wasted gas . the burritos , tacos , beans , rice are all good . the food is top notch . if you go during lunch on a work week be prepared to wait
3 i gave hap 's a 4 star because their ribs are damn good . i have ordered the same item during lunch time . so my review may not included all that hap 's has to offer . i ordered a ribs & chicken combo with 1 side and a
3 let me just preface by saying that i do n't like bbq -lrb- not the flavor , nor the smell , etc. . . -rrb- . it was against my better judgement to visit this place and even consider eating here as i do n't enjoy the taste at all
3 love this place - have been here several times and would definitely go again if it was n't so far from home and work . the ambiance is fabulous ! the teppan table is the best and the sushi is good too . only 4 stars because i have n't
3 great location . always solid food and drinks . a great place to people watch . also my bf likes to watch games here . <unk> -lrb- i think that 's her name -rrb- is attentive and pleasant .
2 i prefer their la <unk> location . went with a large group and the staff handled us pretty well . only complaint was that the staff did n't pull the the empty wine glasses when we ordered a different bottle . is it too much to ask for a new
4 great great great food . holy mole -lrb- the dish -rrb- ! it was soooo good . my bf had a margarita that was awesome as well . heard they have a new scottsdale location . fingers crossed !
1 worst tortilla soup i have ever it tasted it was like a hot bowl of salsa plain and simple . if i would have been given chips i may have eaten it . the server was really cute and attentive but she had no clue what to suggest for a
3 a group of us went last night for amanda b 's sister 's bday celebration . the bread was seriously <unk> <unk> . the waiter was great he had no issues with the large party and making different checks for everyone he was very pleasant thats hard to find these
4 this place was very busy so be prepared or do carryout ; -rrb- i had to try the vodka and fiorentina after dallas g. 's review = -rrb- it was super yummy just like he said and i 'd eat here often if i was a down towner ! i
2 this place has been packed for dinner since it opened a few weeks ago . we had pizza this time while pizza is thin and crispy and pretty good it is over priced for what it is they do not look like their picture 's with pile 's of stuff
2 i pretty much just like eating sushi here and its not all that great here . i dont ever pick this place by choice its always someone 's birthday or something and they have never been so we all end up here like other 's have said . they do
2 tried it once more since lucky 's closed i have to find a new pizza place . sigh ... service is excellent they knew immediately what we ordered last time . we tried the signature pizza this time since its the most popular . the delivery was very quick i
3 came here for a late lunch with my wife . i ordered the pork belly tacos and she ordered their chicken sandwich . the pork belly tacos were great - flavorful pork belly , crispy and fresh veggies , and tasty sauce with the perfect amount of cotija cheese .
3 you want pizza ? they 've got pizza . i always order the sicilian pizza from this place - it is the best traditional pizza in arizona - hands down .
4 very knowledgeable wait staff to help suggest wine pairings with your meal , and the food is consistently amazing from bite to bite and dish to dish . a very romantic place to take your significant other , or just an excellent place to have a terrific meal with friends
3 my wife , sister-in-law and i were out last night and got into a discussion about `` dive bars . '' my <unk> claimed that the <unk> room was a `` dive , '' i kindly and <unk> disagreed . then my wife said that our present bar , hazelwood

3 the bar is dark and the ceilings are low . the beer is strong and the music is loud . for some reason every time i go here , i have a fantastic night ! the live music ranges from crap to pretty good ... but the vibe is always
3 i know i can buy <unk> cheaper at nordstrom . nordstrom , however , is neither locally-owned nor on the light rail ! plus , i know for sure there 's a bike rack at frances , and i can also support stinkweeds at the same shopping center !
0 ugh . my <unk> should have been the guy who saw me reading the menu and came outside to tell me the food was good . but i was craving chinese , i work near the cofco center , and it was threatening to rain . i scanned the menu

4 great selection of yogurt , impressive toppings and a very friendly staff . you will not be disappointed !!
4 we stopped in here with some friends after having dinner at hula 's friday night . they have a great selection of froyo , lots of toppings to go on top of my cake batter and they 're not one of those snooty places that gets the sample for you
3 great cowboy atmosphere , and the food is good too !
3 great burgers , not so great atmosphere !
2 wonderful atmosphere , but food is nothing special !
3 my wife and i stopped in for a lunch here and found this to be a nice , convenient lunch stop with good food and good service . burger was cooked to temp perfectly . i had their namesake burger appropriately called the `` blu burger '' and it rocked
3 the fact that it is right across from the apple store means they have instant <unk> and credibility . : -rrb- but seriously , the food was good . i had a strawberry salad with grilled chicken that was outstanding and really enjoyed it . the portion size of the

4 what 's not to love about trader joe 's ? everyone who works there is really pleasant and their produce and other items are great and reasonably priced . their salad mixes are awesome and are what i 'm currently hooked on .
3 this place is a bit oddly located in an otherwise residential neighborhood . the patio here is awesome and a great place to go for dinner at dusk . while you 're waiting cozy up to the bar where one of the friendly bartenders will serve you up an expertly
3 i 'm starting to appreciate the concept of a little more of an upscale breakfast . long gone are my undergrad days at nau when we 'd stumble into mike and rhonda 's at 6am -lrb- because we 'd been up drinking all night -rrb- and could n't give two
2 probably not my first choice of places to hit -lrb- i live fairly close and can probably count on one hand the number of times i 've been here -rrb- . the place tends to get a little too crowded for my taste and if you 're not there for
4 i 'm not a breakfast person . it takes a lot to get my lazy ass out of bed so breakfast never was my thing . joe 's is one of those dining experiences that is an exception to that rule . the bacon and sausage are hearty , they
3 i was jonesing for a late night glass of wine and some food so i popped in here for reverse happy hour . i like what they 've done with the place . the bar area reminds me just a little of side bar but with more seating and open
1 not a bad place . probably one of your better bets if you 're meeting someone for lunch -lrb- it 's down phoenix after all ! -rrb- the atmosphere is lively enough with every sporting event showing on the multiple tvs . service was good , and fast and efficient
3 i 'm really happy that this place moved in to what was oakville grocery . they still have the coffee bar so that makes me a happy camper . they also still have the coolers with pre-packaged food and drinks . they now have a <unk> set-up in the center
3 i 've wanted to check this place out for a long time and i was not disappointed . this is where i will bring my out of town friends to prove to them that arizona is cool . despite being relatively small the high ceiling and bay windows give the
3 this place is pretty damned good and i 'm disappointed that i did n't try it sooner . i did n't understand the concept of fresh , healthy upscale eating so i was surprised that everything was so delicious while <unk> <unk> my <unk> waistline . it just goes to
2 i know i would have given the bar 5 stars if i had come here for drinks because it 's pretty cool . but i came here for dinner . we started with the appetizer sampler which was good but not great . my main was mahi-mahi and it was
4 it <unk> me to admit this but i only just recently discovered short leash dogs but i am thrilled that they now have a permanent spot in downtown . these guys truly represent what local business is all about : they serve up a unique , high quality product and
3 this place is huge and cavernous and kind of reminds me of the yard house . they have a great selection of beer on tap and i <unk> my thirst repeatedly with the <unk> <unk> pilsner . i did n't sample the food but the menu looks like a step
4 i think royal is my favorite coffee place in phoenix . i really like the coffee at lux but it is always so damned crowded and the attitude of a lot of the clientele is so <unk> sometimes that i find it difficult to even spend the time to wait
1 love the atmosphere . i 've had better <unk>
4 fave ladies who brunch spot .
3 awesome burgers and beer selection .
2 they lose 1 star for not having any hard cider in stock ... supposedly they ran out . i ca n't drink beer so i was left to drink a very fruity cosmo . overall , this place is n't anything special . i hear the beer is good though
2 i 've been here twice and the food is decent - i would n't seek it out , but it 's not bad for a quick lunch . i really liked the sweet potato fries and that dipping ranch sauce that comes with it . the service is ok ...
3 i 'm not a huge fan of <unk> bars , but i really liked hazelwoods . we came with a few friends on a friday night and played team trivia - even took third place and won a $ 10 gift cert ! we did n't eat , so i
2 good mexican food , but not great . we got there just in time to take advantage of the .99 margarita 's , but the food was n't anything super special . the salsa was knock your socks off hot , which kind of <unk> your tastebuds to other flavors
3 nice little lunch buffet at a fair price . they had a fantastic chick pea salad and i really liked the <unk> chicken and rice pudding . i even got a $ 5.00 off coupon on their website , which made it a very economical lunch choice .
4 sarah a and i came here during restaurant week and enjoyed a fantastic meal . we both got different dishes for each course which was nice because we could sample each others . i even got a succulent salad which was crunchy and refreshing . i 'll be back with
0 my friend p and i have been waiting for what seems like forever for this place to open . finally , a taste of la grande <unk> and pizzeria bianco in ahwatukee ? it 's about time . these at least were supposed to be some of the guys behind
3 consistently good , but consistently slow . the rolls are great though and they will make substitutions . ada g. and i love the baked scallop roll and their ahi <unk> salad is a favorite too . we 've <unk> up and gotten the toddler his own ahi roll on
2 let this be <unk> with the fact that i do n't like <unk> . in any way shape or form . this does n't mean i do n't like working out , i just do n't much care for gyms . i was hoping this one would be better as
3 i enjoyed a delicious meal here on the yelp elite night and what a treat ! we started with some delicious apps including shrimp cocktail and pate . i started my culinary adventure with the wedge salad -lrb- i just ca n't get enough blue cheese -rrb- then the prime
3 delicious and worth trying , but build into your evening the waiting time . i recommend hanging out next door and having a cocktail . as for the food , the pizza is good , but there is a lot of other good pizza in phoenix -lrb- like lgo -rrb-
2 we came here last week for restaurant week and sad to say , it was my least favorite of the places we went to . i started out with the black bean soup which was delicious , but in my opinion , easy to get right . for the next
3 i 've only been here for happy hour , but it was great . we ordered the sliders on the recommendation of other yelpers and they were delectable . the ahi roll -lrb- and some other roll -rrb- were just ok . next time i 'm just ordering double sliders
2 i met sarah m. for lunch today . i think ra is an ok place for happy hour . decent drink specials and their crunchy spicy tuna roll is yummy . for meals in general , just ok . we both had the <unk> bowl , mine without rice with
2 my friend , my toddler and i enjoyed lunch here today on their beautiful patio . our mouths watered the entire drive there as we talked about the menu -lrb- we had looked it up on-line -rrb- and discussed what we would order . we were immediately seated even though
3 back when i was amongst the working class before the housing market <unk> and <unk> still needed interior designers to do their model homes , we ordered a lot of lunches a lot of times -lrb- seriously , a lot -rrb- from haji . really , when you order that
4 great food and service .
4 best vietnamese ever . outstanding service . owners even remember their regular customers names .
3 i love the breakfast here . even though you get there and they seem swamped they are really efficient at moving tables . we 've never waited more than 5-10 minutes for a table even on weekends . i have only had breakfast there so i can only attest for
2 i am a huge fan of this place after my first visit this past saturday night ! we had a few drinks at the bar then played some shuffleboard . the bartender recommended a moscow mule which definitely hit the spot . the drinks were a bit pricey but that
2 oh boy ! i hope the crowd was just due to the `` free '' movie tickets for the <unk> show we attended last night . the theater was good size and decent but i felt like i was in another , rough part of town ! enjoyed the show
0 i came in just to get a gift cards . i waited in what seemed to be a takeout line . the girl was texting on her phone and not paying attention to me , who had n't been helped . the people standing near the counter were waiting on
3 cool patio and interesting games to drum up business at odd times . -lrb- goldfish racing !?!?! awesome but do n't tell <unk> . -rrb- good hh and looks like it would be fun to watch a game there .
4 great food and drinks and even better patio . a little pricy though .
3 this place never fails my taste buds . there are so many delicious things to order off the pages and pages of menu . we started with the artichoke and it was scrumptious . both of the dipping sauces were yummy and the artichoke was cooked perfectly . after we
3 i 'm so happy places like this exist . i have such a finicky diet nowadays with various adult <unk> ... wtf happened to me ? anyways , places like this make it all better . everything was gf , which was the best part . there were also a
3 yes this is a chain . but i really like it nonetheless . what can i say ? it 's super tasty ! it 's also a good place to grab dinner at 10:30 pm on a saturday when nowhere else is still open ... although i would 've wanted
3 i can see myself coming here a few times a month , easy . the dark atmosphere , the live music , the wine , the finger foods , the great service , these all add up to a fantastic evening . the company i was with just made it
2 it 's time to put on those heels and <unk> your stuff , ladies . you 're about to be ... seen . this is that place . it 's white and glass and mirrors and swank , martinis and cocktails and ... hamburgers on plastic plates ? that 's
0 no . i do n't think so . i 'm in the service industry . i get out of work and want to have a drink . this means i 'm going to be arriving at your bar later in the evening . we walked in at around 11 .
4 oh breakfast , you 're my best friend . let 's be pals forever and for always . butterfields offers so many choices , it 's almost absurd . you can choose between breakfast or lunch . . although for me , it 's no contest . breakfast wins every
4 go diamondbacks ! i 've been coming to this stadium since their inaugural game back in 1998 ! i still sport my purple and <unk> hat to the games ... i just ca n't get down with the sedona red . we had season tickets for the first three or
3 animal . style . i see you baby , <unk> my cheeseburger with special sauce and pickles and onions . and oh god , is that mustard in the burger ? how dare you ! to think i would ruin such an amazing creation with a tomato or lettuce .
1 `` why is everything i touch sticky ? '' that pretty much sums things up for saddle ranch . we sat at the bar for a quick drink before heading in to <unk> arena . we were robbed , <unk> a bit in the lack of air condition , and
2 ya know how people say `` i really wanted to like this place '' or `` i want to like this place more than i do '' ? it 's such a stupid thing to say , because obviously you want to like a place , you do n't go
1 andreoli , you disappoint me . here 's why ... after not visiting you for nearly a year , i craved your food . either you are resting on your laurels or stopped caring or both . with crummy weather that we had today , a friend suggested your restaurant
4 finally ... an original steakhouse , . . considering they have been <unk> like <unk> in the past 12 months . the place was packed ... i wonder why ? it was a weekday . the food was awesome . no confusion as there is no menu . you just
4 dining at mastro 's steakhouse is always an expensive proposition . however , after considering the superb quality of the food and the flawless service , i conclude the overall experience is nearly worth every penny . my favourite item on the menu ... ? ... actually it 's not
3 not a bad place for happy hour -lrb- 3-6 pm -rrb- , you can get their flatbreads for half off . service was friendly and efficient . my only wish is that that food selection for happy hour would be a bit larger . i know maggiano 's is known
2 the good egg , while a no-frills diner - needs to understand a simple notion about food service . not all sauces are created equal ! a perfect example is the description of the eggs benedict on the menu ... which ends saying '' topped with hollandaise sauce '' anybody
3 my only wish was that fnb was a little closer . otherwise , i really can not fault the restaurant for anything . the portions are manageable , the prices are right , and the flavors are outstanding . the staff truly has a knack for making you feel welcome
1 things must have gone down the drain since my last visit as my last experience in terms of food quality was <unk> than the smiling waitress , the <unk> rolls tasted right out of the freezer and my chicken curry was everything left to be desired . the chicken did
1 when this place was named <unk> 's , i never had an issue with the place - in fact , they used to have the best muffins , enough to warrant me making a road trip from north scottsdale just to get a muffin and espresso . although i realize
3 my meal was great ; the decor / layout is great also , with a lovely patio out back . the only downsides are parking , and the fact that the entrance is also their smoking area - you approach the entrance and see nothing but <unk> ! i ca
4 great first visit ! i 'll try again soon and we 'll see if they can keep the 5 star rating . i have to say , i 'm loving this corner of frank lloyd and via linda - several great options -lrb- <unk> , with pars , <unk> ,
4 been back several times , still holding up ! the ` red chili pork posole ' is truly awesome ! the pork adovado is great too . now that it is winter time , i 've found the interior to be way too cold - i end up keeping my
4 i actually went to postino and drank beer . i know , what was i thinking right ? but they had a pumpkin ale on tap and i 'd been drinking a lot of wine lately so we went for it . the one thing i have to say about
4 the keg is me and tom 's date-night tradition . whenever he 's in town we try to make at least one trip there . i ca n't say exactly what it is , but there 's an overall feeling that everytime we go it 's a great experience .
3 ok so the sushi is decent - i mean it 's definitely not the best sushi i 've ever had but it is good . the real reason i rated it so high was the experience and price . it 's a lot of fun to sit there with friends
3 the vig is a little too far away and a little too expensive for it to be a regular spot for my group . that said , i 've never had a bad night at a vig -lrb- there are two locations now - so be specific when telling your
3 i feel like i 'm getting away with something ... how is it i can get so much and pay so little ? i cancelled my membership at yoga <unk> -lrb- see my review -rrb- and started at lifetime . i loved yoga <unk> - <unk> was amazing ! but
1 i would n't recommend this place to any one i like . what kind of restaurant serves salads and charges you for the dressing ? i ordered the <unk> sandwich and was charged an extra <unk> for the lettuce , which i can kind of understand but even still ,
3 i made it ! haha , barely . if you are new to hiking i definitely recommend north mountain . it 's a great place to start - i took my dog with me -lrb- not sure if that 's allowed -rrb- but he and i both needed <unk> climb
4 i just love the keg . something i like is the consistency of the service , no matter where i go , i get great service and have a great time . this trip i got the classic prime rib meal and followed it with the keg 's amazing creme

1 most confusing airport ever ! i 've been to quite a few airports and i 've never seen an airport so difficult to navigate , that includes walking around inside and driving on the roads outside . just very poor signage . airport is nicely updated though ...
4 i liked this theater because it is not too huge or too small . it 's easy to navigate and is not overwhelming . i did n't feel like a <unk> going through security . it was fast and they were friendly .
4 i had another fabulous lunch at the eagles buffet today . i really enjoy the variety of selections here , i do n't believe that it 's ever been the same in all the times i 've tried it . for those of us who `` try '' to be
0 i was really hungry for lunch and craving hummus ... too bad that i was n't able to eat here because i was completely ignored by the <unk> . i wanted to place an order to go , stood looking at the menu , put it down , waited ,
2 so , i 'll admit that i 'm a *** bertos addict ... i truly crave this food and i 'm not really sure why . my mom says that she ate nachos w / jalepenos on a regular basis while pregnant with me . maybe that explains it .
4 i finally had the opportunity to try this place . the atmosphere is fabulous ... love the decor which feels sort of chic , elegant yet understated with a great mix of colors and textures ... i 'm very aesthetic and a beautifully decorated restuarant <unk> <unk> my reviews :
2 i 've enjoyed my couple of experiences here . the sandwiches and light platters were enjoyable . the piano bar can get a bit too loud so it 's hard to have conversation with dinner . pricing seems a bit high but for a once in a while treat it
4 oh my , the tastebuds are singing a happy tune ! never did i think i 'd eat pineapple and coconut on a hot dog or slider ... it was surprisingly delicious . i ordered an island dog , a chicago dog and three sliders hawaiian style , all with
3 udupi saved my <unk> ! i had to have an event catered and the place i planned on using could not accomodate our time . i needed food at noon , they did n't open till 3pm ! shame on me for not checking , but hey we live in

4 great cheap food . bring a tums with you , just in case . i do n't know how they can have such amazing low prices and still have a great tasting taco ?! makes me wonder ... but more power to them . this is a great place to

3 we tried cyprus grill for the first time tonight and were really impressed ! the service was very friendly and fast . we started out with the hummus appetizer and it was really tasty . you could tell the pita and hummus were both fresh . their hummus is a
3 this used to be the the fish market . it looks similar to the old restaurant but with a fresher look . i 'm glad they kept the fish market employees because our waitress was very friendly and attentive . we came for the happy hour / small plate menu
3 yum city ! i went here with a group of friends after having a few drinks and it was delicious . my fiance and i split the `` baseball winner '' which had strawberry ice cream , mint chocolate chip ice cream topped with hot fudge and melted marshmallow sauce
3 in my opinion this is one of the best thai restaurants in <unk> . i frequently get the drunken noodle with chicken and it 's always delicious ! the portions are big especially for the price . the next day leftovers are even more spicy and delicious . the parking
4 i ca n't say enough nice things about carolina 's . we eat here just about once a week because it 's so affordable and delicious . also , there is just something so comforting about a warm homemade tortilla the size of a tire . my absolute favorite menu
3 i love chicago dogs . they do them pretty good too . i love the gyros as well . never been disappointed !
3 i have never been to chicago . but i love chicago food . chicago <unk> co. makes me feel like im there . the sliders are pretty awesome . my favorite is the traditional vienna chicago dog . with all the chicago decor on the walls . my favorite is
3 absolutely love kilt lifter ! love the flavor and <unk> of this beer . . great food too for a brewery . i have tried many things here and have not been disappointed yet . the nachos rock ! definitely worth checking out .
0 no to the food no to the service no to the prices no to the way .
4 idk why this place does n't have 5 stars from everyone ?!?! everything is delicious . best fajitas in the whole world . not even joking . i have a hard time ordering anything else so i do n't . but i have tried other things from friends and everything
3 i had n't been to valle luna since i was a kid , but we went here recently and it was so great . i mean , it was n't like amazing mexican homemade food , but it 's pretty darn good for what it is . their salsa is
1 i do n't get it . our service was no bueno . our waiter rarely came around and kept forgetting things . also , they tried dusting our booth in the middle of our meal . i thought that was extremely tacky , it was n't even close to closing
2 <unk> i love the comment about the cougars . my friend and i had the exact same observation . i have been twice , the first time was the best . we had the perfect spot on the patio . we ordered one of their pizzas -lrb- really tasty -rrb-
1 i am just not a fan of this kind of pizza . i hate the sweet sauce , i hate that the ingredients are under the cheese so they do n't get crunchy and crispy , the pepperoni is <unk> . just not for me . the crust was kinda
2 i mean , it 's just average . lots of old people . lots of regulars . i wish i could give 5 stars solely for our waitress . in fact , i 'm going to write the manager to tell them about our awesome waitress . seriously , who
4 we sat at the chefs table and i love the eye contact razz makes . some people never look you in the eye and thats a huge pet peeve of mine . but razz locks eyes and i love it . i guess you could call me an <unk> whore
4 dang it ! my cubano was so good !! it was <unk> to me by the <unk> . i wanted something on the sweeter side that was also strong . this came with 2 shots of espresso , cinnamon and milk . it was <unk> . i also liked the
4 um wow i was a bit nervous trying this place for lunch since everyone says it 's so slow but we took a risk and we told our waitress we were on a lunch break . she was so awesome about it ! we were in and out of there
3 can we have a moment of silence for the carnitas street tacos ? let 's pay our respect for the carne asada . what is the secret ingredient in those beans ?? i ca n't pin point it but those beans are something else . we wanted to try it
2 a bit pricey the personal pizza starts at $ 9 and then each topping ranges from $ 2 - $ 4 . i added sweet red peppers , pepperoni , <unk> olives . very tasty but idk . we split a small caesar , i had a tea and the
2 i was n't impressed . i have only had their dessert so i will have to come back and try their entrees ... but dessert wise , no thanks . i really like the patio and people watching , it 's a great spot . i hope when i sit
2 not too bad , my mom friends and i came here for breakfast and had to wait over half an hour for a table -lrb- i understand we have four babies total but come on , they would n't even let us push two tables together outside -rrb- . the
2 i like ra , but their specialty drinks have never been very good . the food is n't bad or too expensive , but for some reason i just do n't love this place . you ca n't smoke on the patio -lrb- might be some sort of law that
4 we come to <unk> all the time , we love it ! my favorite is the club sandwich with the chicken pot pie soup , so so good ! i like that they put a lot of meat on their sandwiches so you do n't feel like you 're getting
4 kinda torn between a 4 and a 5 here . been here three times now and it 's hard to have any complaints about the vig . i love the service , i love the ambience , and i am never disappointed with the food . here 's the breakdown
3 went last night and had the following : apps : mixed vegetables - really good , loved the pickled carrots ! <unk> <unk> - delicious ! basically a toasty focaccia bread with mozz and veggies in the middle . prob my favorite part of the meal . pizza : vegetariana
2 mushroom was very good , but i 've had better - 3.5 stars . margherita and sop were less than thrilling , left me wanting more - 2.5 stars each . garlic fries and brussels sprouts were also underwhelming - 2 stars for both . humble pie is fine but
2 it 's so nice to find another local place to have breakfast ! however , a few things i found annoying and i 've only been there twice . each time i 've been there on a weekend morning , one of the registers was not working correctly . menus
2 nye 2013 winter wonderland party was ok . not bad but could be so much better ! there are so many things they will need to improve upon for 2014 . 1 . -rrb- bar : we could never get up to the bar so one of the waitresses waited
3 breakfast is the most important meal of the day , and matt sure likes his eggs and bacon in the morning hours ! i was actually able to get into their newest location and sit a the bar . i 'm not a big lady but the stools were tiny
3 when i 'm sick , i get pho tai and add a lot of spice ! knocks it right out of me , and for only $ 5 . . ummm yeah ! i love this place , with such a great variety of choices , it can be a
2 i think everytime i 've gone to hula 's , i 've always had disappointment , even though the fish is probably the freshest , and living on the islands for 5 years , it 's the closest but not exact . one sunday evening , i decided to take
0 nye , we attended the lustre bar winter wonderland nye party . we could n't get a drink at the bar due to stressed out waitresses and a very crowded bar . so we went downstairs for a drink at 12:30 . we were told that they already had last

4 to be able to sit in a big comfy chair , eat some good food and drink a beer while in a movie theater is an absolutely wonderful idea . i would highly recommend for everyone to try this even once . the price is steep at $ 18 a
4 i 'm usually not one to drive 35 minutes for brunch , or even to tempe at all , but this place was well worth it . best french toast i 've ever had . my friends also got the biscuits and gravy , crepes and eggs . the benedict

3 i 've never seen so much junk look so cool ! bicycle wheels , hanging <unk> <unk> , and more ... this place is very quaint and laid back . its even got a <unk> bay door in the back which -lrb- when open -rrb- almost makes you feel like
4 dobson and queen creek ?!?!?! is n't that like ... mexico ? it does n't matter ! the drive was worth it . we got there at around 7:30 and the place was roaring with people . as we waited for a table , some drunk chick passes us as
4 love this place . the atmosphere is fun , the place is packed every time i go with my vegetarian friend . so many choices , i want to try them all ! service is fast , likely because it 's do popular that they want to move people thru
4 this location , as all others i 've been to , have friendly cashiers , long waits -lrb- since it 's so popular and food is made fresh , not like panda express -rrb- . i love the lettuce wraps , soups , crab puffs , etc. .
1 went because i had a groupon so i thought i 'd try it . overpriced for the food quality . clam chowder was full of sand <unk> . for the price i would have expected zero sand in it . the appetizer steamed mussels were a plenty . enough for
4 this place is great ! i 've been here -lrb- not often -rrb- over the past 8-10 years and they always have great , tender ribs . the combination meat sampler plate is great for first timers . pricing is a little high but that 's because bbq is n't
4 america 's taco shops have great atmosphere . their food is super , and i love it when they have specials . the chips and salsa , delicious . and the people are always nice here . the only drawback is that they do n't stay open super late .
3 this place exceeded my expectations . the fish was very fresh the night we were there . the bartender was great and the fish portions were bigger then average . i enjoyed the sashimi a lot more then the sushi and the rolls . the quality of fish seemed better
2 this is a good quick on the run taco shop . tucked back in a shopping center . the place is smaller . the tacos are decent and my kids love the burritos .
3 this place has a very cool vibe to it . we decided to sit outside but the inside is darling . the bar is also nice front and center as you walk in the door . waitress was ok . she sort of disappeared right before we were ready to
2 better than hooters and tilted kilt - both in food and quality of hot chicks . hooters was hot chicks and lame food of the 90s , tilted kilt was hot chicks and better food of the 00s - so this is the latest and greatest until someone better comes
1 we were stuck in chandler , called a friend and he recommended this place . it 's not bad . just average . i guess it is owned by <unk> mexican restaurant so <unk> all the food had a mexican flair to it . you get a lot of food
3 there were so many rave reviews about this on yelp and in phoenix magazine , while visiting the scottsdale fashion mall - we decided to stop by for lunch . i liked it a lot . i like the vibe and the food . first - you must order the
2 not bad food , absolutely superb patio but very , very spendy . expect to pay $ 100 for 2 people . service was a bit slow for a sunday night . i would go again . i loved the burger , but the filet and the short ribs were
3 we happened into solo on a friday night . we shared the burrata , beet salad , and the gnocchi -- all of which was quite good . the gnocchi was light and complemented the sauce . because they were having a quiet night , they also offered us tastes
1 i love pane bianco -- but sadly they have priced me out of their market for the most part when it comes to sandwiches . $ 13 for their tuna sandwich is outrageous -- and beyond a price point that i am willing to pay under any circumstances . at
2 met some friends at otro saturday night . even though our table was set -- we waited almost 15 minutes to be seated and this was at 6:00 pm . otro is just okay -- nothing knock your socks off about anything -- i had a trout special -- the
1 summer <unk> perhaps ? i have been to st. francis a number of times and generally the food has been quite delightful until last night -- a friend and i went for dinner -- and enough things were n't right to write a review and wave a little warning flag
2 been here a few times and the sushi itself is pretty decent . sitting outside on the side , not front , is nice . the service tends to be a little slow and disorganized . they brought the food out in a very strange order so half of us
1 i have a lot of the same things to say . celebrity is old but has a nice circular stage and great acoustics . dodge is nice and more expensive but a great place to see a concert . my beef with marquee has always been that it is a
4 we have been here a zillion times since my first review a few years ago and love the place more than ever . the food is always good , tasty , and big portions . we 've gotten to know all of the servers and they are all attentive ,
3 been here several times and although a little pricier than celebrity or marquee , ticket and <unk> , still a great venue . nice seats , good acoustics , plenty of bars and bathrooms . will go back for concerts . probably have been here a dozen times over the
3 have been here maybe three times and will continue to go . the chorizo and eggs with hot flour tortillas are great . whether you 're tired and hung over , or not , they are typically served fast and have a nice kick . the huevos rancheros with green
3 like this place . the inside does look like a pub to some degree but with <unk> of wine bar throughout . the wine list was nice and different . the patio was cool at night with the misters . just be careful because one of the couches gets soaked
3 this place is more over a 41/2 but at least a 4 . the breakfast , lunch , and dinner are all worthwhile . we 've tried them all . been here many many times . the bar is fun to grab a drink at during games or on a
3 probably more of a 31/2 but it 's close to a 4 so what the hell . tasty 2 gyro plate with fries , it 's a make your own plate basically . the young girl at the counter was very friendly and the food came up fast for take
1 the only good thing is the cheesecake . the food is terribly mediocre . and i hate how they seem to all be decorated like ruins of some sort . i want some damn food not an expedition with <unk> !
4 i love ikea . its just <unk> cheap furniture . which is excellent for me since i change my mind about stuff so fast , it wont cost me an arm and a leg to decorate that way . i also love their lingonberry jam and swedish meatballs . oh
3 this place is n't too shabby . they have decent sushi and other items , but they do n't have smoking sections ... i mean i know that thing is going to pass , but not yet as of this review . the staff is interesting to watch when you
2 another great place for lunch . nothing special , just good food . always consistent . the mongolian beef and cashew chicken are always good . they always have good lunch specials .
3 been going to harvey 's for years . the place is a dump , but it is my kind of dive . you have to get the wineburger . you wo n't be sorry ! one of the best burgers i 've had .
3 i really enjoyed <unk> we went as a group and mostly all had the kobe beef hamburgers . everyone enjoyed them . we had a lot of appetizers too , including onion strings -lrb- just ok -rrb- , shrimp cocktail , fried shrimp , fries and we actually ordered a
4 stopped into aj 's this afternoon and their bbq on the patio is outstanding . great big fat hot dogs off the grill and fresh hamburgers and chicken . the patio is very relaxing . great food and great people watching in north scottsdale .
3 had lunch at frank and lupe 's today . great new mexican food . i had a taco salad which was terrific , other had a burrito , and taco 's along with rice and beans . everyone enjoyed their meals .
3 we found lustre on yelp , and had to ask a vallet attendant how to find the place . it turns out it was on the roof patio of a hotel downtown , but it was such a gem ! very cool vibe , wonderful view of the downtown city
4 i liked film bar a lot ! the decor was cool , very cozy and they had neat moroccan lanterns hanging around the place . i got a good vibe walking in . they also had great drink specials - 2 for 5 local drafts which you ca n't beat
3 the farm at south mountain is so very quaint , and does n't feel like you are in the middle of phoenix . when i went it was for a self lead venue tour , so i was free to roam the property - and i was most impressed with
4 wildflower bread company is such a wonderful restaurant . i pop in for a quick meal fairly often as i live across the street . the ingredients are always fresh , healthy , and delicious ! you order at the counter and then sit wherever you like and they bring
2 due to new changes this place only has the <unk> pizza as take out only ... went in on a tuesday night there were 2 other tables in the place ... and found out that i could n't order a <unk> pizza ... i ordered a regular pizza and it
3 fusion ? i do n't think so . its a pan-asian - pacific rim place ... is it the best thai ? ... no but its good is it the best chinese ? ... no but its good is it the best vietnamese ? ... no but its ok is
2 i was invited to a rehearsal dinner hosted here . we were sectioned off in our own area with a bar , tables , and patio facing the pretty <unk> of many old town scottsdale shops and restaurants . best : chips and guac are addicting , salsa was ok
3 the epitome of old school cool . the decor and feel of mabel 's is elegant and unique . they 've got the whole speakeasy , <unk> look going for them , and it 's going well ! be ready for a wait if you 're not early . this
4 it could be the sauce . no , maybe the crust . the cheese ? the way they tuck pepperoni underneath ? whatever it is , these guys make one fantastic pie . the pizza at little chicago is always fresh in a way that you can almost taste each
3 philly 's is an excellent place to catch your typical sports game , notable soccer match or ufc fight . the restaurant area is a decent size with tvs everywhere especially the inside bar area . outside , there 's tons of seating all around the patio including a rounded
3 betty 's is all about the ambience . it 's a biker dive with hot , <unk> 'd - up waitresses dancing on the bar , paying homage to classic rock and eclectic decor that <unk> the same theme . i go here because you can let your hair down
2 now that i 've had time to reflect on my recent visit i 've decided overall i did enjoy my experience here . at first i was a little put off by the crowd but i now realize it was a based off a preconceived notion i had based completely
2 i think this is one of those places i 'll need to visit a few more times to get a real feel for the place . the bacon cheese fries where really good however the <unk> did n't seem like it had very much kick to it . perhaps it
4 i love songbird , like `` will you marry me '' love . it reminds me of some of my favorite coffee places back in boulder co. . it is the type of place you can just get the beverage of your choice , maybe a snack and hang out
4 today was my fourth visit to green , i 've tried something new each time . i continue to be surprised how delicious vegan food can be . the mock chicken is surprisingly good and i ca n't believe how good the <unk> is . i plan on trying everything
3 <unk> ... cheap champagne in a cool , loungy atmosphere ? yes please ! this place almost instantly made it to the top of my list of happy hour locations when we were presented with our first round of rose ' champagne on the house , simply because i had
4 any time i am in the mood for a delicious salad or a hot cup of soup -lrb- which is often -rrb- , paradise bakery is the absolute first place i think about . the food is amazing -lrb- caesar salad - yum . chicken noodle soup - yum .
3 this place is the quintessential neighborhood deli / eatery on weekend mornings , and a fabulous little pizza parlor in the evenings . it 's hard to pull off both in the same location , but la grande orange does it amazingly well ! the food is delicious , although
1 <unk> . this place is pretty gross . i 've been here once , and hope to never have to go there again . their ` patio ' area is just a big smokers den - with <unk> all over the seats and tables . the interior smells funky and
3 i went to the vig twice this weekend , and both times it was awesome . on sunday , i went for breakfast after going to the gym . we sat outside on their gorgeous outdoor patio , right next to the fire . the food was amazing -lrb- i
3 3 words : soon . doo . boo . that is all .
1 so i 've never been here before and wanted to try the sushi . i got an omakase deluxe sushi combination , which was one of kabuki 's recommended dishes . it <unk> not very good ! the spicy tuna roll was extremely sloppy and the fish was not very
4 i am sooooo excited my neighborhood finally has a place we can go for great food ! my husband and i stopped in to this small establishment , and we were greeted by two smiling faces . we ordered the reuben for me , and my husband ordered a single
4 may i add `` family friendly '' to my past reviews ? we love this place because we feel like we are home when we come here . the staff is kind and they always welcome us with open arms . the manager , <unk> , literally treats us like
4 returned to this place and still love it !! i decided i would love it more if they had normal happy hours . the hh begins at 8 ? strange . we would go more often if it began at 4 or 5 and lasted until 6 or 7 .
3 dive <unk> ! cold <unk> ! pool , darts , and other fun bar <unk> ! if you are looking for a friendly atmosphere and a great place to gather , this is the place . there is nothing hoity toity about this place . i sponsored an event here
3 nice local place . my husband eats to go from here at least once a week . today we went there , together , for lunch . i had a yummy antipasta salad with the best house italian dressing . the oil and vinegar , not the creamy . the
0 the reason i yelp is for entertainment and because i use the reviews from others to choose where i spend my money , so i like doing my part by sharing my own experiences . my intention is not to get free stuff . ever . i rarely write negative
4 agree with daren , <unk> <unk> stars ! the facts , and nothing but the facts : 1 -rrb- it 's close to home ! 2 -rrb- they have only been in business 10 weeks . 3 -rrb- they are really nice , the two guys that own and work
4 son of a <unk> ! saw joel 's rotd and had the day off during the week and took a chance -lrb- have driven by but as arlin said , the outside , not so pretty and never took that chance based on looks alone -rrb- , and so glad
2 rarely go out to this side of town . the skeptical chymist , cool name , average `` irish '' pub . the inside was nothing special and lacked the charm that say , tim finnegan 's has . i also disliked that the outside area where the smokers are
3 had a few margaritas with some great friends and a wave of hunger came over us on a hot june saturday night . where to go ? order in , order out ? please make a decision <unk> . and then it hit us : arcadia tavern ! -lrb- donald
3 saw stevey 's rotd yesterday and was craving some taco shop kind of food , so monday night it was on . inside yet another vague strip mall location , in what was a chicken and ribs joint that lasted about a year , lies the little tacos atoyac .
3 friday night . scottsdale . about as scottsdale as one could imagine . rolled up in the beater to the red carpet valet parking . <unk> took our car and off we went . our reservations were waiting . good thing because its a very popular spot . if the
2 do n't get me wrong , big fan of ajs , especially this central and <unk> location . always enjoyed the area and going in for a specialty item or perhaps a nice breakfast burrito or omelet to go on a sunday morning . never had a concern . sure
3 now this is what i am talking about ! really nice , dropped by on a whim after a little trip to los olivos car wash -lrb- 5 stars -rrb- on a nice saturday afternoon . very cute and shall we say ` urban '' . the <unk> was nice
3 craving a burrito , you know the feeling ... we all know the feeling ... midday , tuesday , hot , hungry . yelped el bravo , great reviews . so , away we go ... i found it with ease and was happy to see it is a no
4 i found a new place , i found a new place ! close to home and very very good sushi ! got there at 8pm on saturday night , to find ourselves at the start of happy hour . great happy hour menu with a nice selection of drinks and
3 got some takeout there tonight , it is right by paradise bakery so it is a decent not too scary strip mall . once inside , it was a small cute little place , not really much to look at but our order was ready , hot , and fresh
2 good food , you come out of there with your clothes smelling like middle eastern food . the younger man with the <unk> and tag watch behind the counter is not that friendly , but the food is decent .
3 always past by but never went , it is close to home so tonight we gave it a shot . got there about 10:30 on a saturday night . very cool place . good black and tans . they had a great irish band there , they were very lively
3 well reviewed , and not much to add here ... on our way to aj 's on easter afternoon , i noticed st francis and said `` hey that is the place with all the good reviews on yelp ! '' and , `` it 's not busy ! ''
4 wonderful . love this place . they cook breakfast exactly how i like it . fast , fresh , perfect western omelet and smoky crisp bacon . they also have nice little touches . note how clean it is in there too . fresh lemon for your water , like
1 fish is not fresh , too much rice , rice of poor quality and too cold . this is worse than the ra in scottsdale that i only eat at when i stay at the hotel it 's in . decent atmosphere here but that 's where the good ends
3 i 've been to at least 50 pho restaurants . i tried the hue version of pho and i like spicy -lrb- hot -rrb- but it was a little overpowering to enjoy the flavor . the quality was there but i still prefer the regular pho and wish i had
3 better than a <unk> in the eye , that 's for sure . in all seriousness , tmi is a great spot thus far for the busy downtown lunch crowd . i 've been twice since opening , once for happy hour drinks and another for lunch . while the
3 let 's talk about the good things at moto . 1 . beer . the owner -lrb- who splits his time between co and az -rrb- does n't mess around with `` typical '' beers . you wo n't find <unk> , miller , coors , <unk> , corona or
2 sandwich lovers <unk> . <unk> hut has some great offerings ; almost everyone should find something they will enjoy here . as you can read in the past reviews , they have a stoner theme . they do n't push it on you , but it 's all around in
2 it was pretty busy in there . we were able to find somewhere to sit right away but it took them awhile to get to clear the dirty table and ask us for our drinks . i ordered the lamb vindaloo . i was told that it was the spiciest
3 i really wanted chilaquiles when i got there but i also wanted menudo . i ended up ordering the red menudo and it was really good . there was no fat in it and most places give you a lot of fat in your bowl . i did need to
3 i love eating here . their food always tastes really fresh and its really affordable . i usually always have exceptional service . i normally eat at <unk> location but think i like the newer mesa location better . i 've eaten lots of different meals there and they are
4 i 've only been there for their wine tastings ... yum ! they had a 5 course meal with 5 different bottles of wine . they even made special arrangements for my wife since she 's a vegetarian -lrb- and we did n't tell them ahead of time -rrb- .
3 huge portions ! food was very good as well ! one of the better bbq places in town !
2 wife and i went a few times ... nothing really jumped out at us as great . however , nothing was ever bad .
2 2.5 stars ... hard to find ... it 's part of the pizza delivery restaurant next door . we found this place from my wife 's friend . <unk> -lrb- breaded dough with queso blanco in the middle -rrb- -lrb- cheese sticks -rrb- were very good ! comes with a
4 unfortunately wife is a vegetarian so it makes it very hard for me to go to bbq places ... not too many side dishes without meat for her : -lrb- brisket is yummy ! only problem is that this place is n't much of a secret ! it gets packed
2 fundito was good ... not great . i got it with pork . the pork was cooked perfectly ... nice and moist . my wife 's bean & cheese burrito was bland -lrb- at best -rrb- . she was n't impressed at all . the salsas -lrb- both mild and
1 lost 2 stars ! sat in the restaurant for 15 minutes ... no waitress ... no water ... no nothing . we left . sad part was there was people who left , then came back and got service before us . the guy who came in after us got
4 6 course wine dinner last night was excellent ! 6 different wines , and 6 absolutely delicious courses . staff was extremely attentive and happy to help with special needs of my wife -lrb- vegetarian -rrb- . her dinners were as good and some even better than mine ! h
3 this is a cute little place and it has delicious ice cream ! where else can you get a scoop of great ice cream with syrup for $ 2.50 ? you can taste test the many flavors before deciding what you want to order . you will be a fan
2 it was spa day at the camelback inn spa . we had <unk> and massages , lunch , and then wanted to have some <unk> since we do n't see each other often . that 's when the trouble began . the quiet police were after us ! finally ,
3 i decided to treat myself to a `` normal '' sandwich from goldman 's today . i ordered the pastrami on rye with lettuce , tomato , mayo and mustard -lrb- well almost normal -rrb- . and since this time i was not in sticker shock i could not help
3 after driving around north phoenix all afternoon my friend and i stopped in to grab a bite to eat . he had been here before and ordered the chicken rice noodle soup and i had the usual pork chop , shredded pork and egg . if i am trying a
2 i was excited to try this restaurant out , especially after <unk> a groupon . the restaurant is in a small mixed use building , which makes the parking situation very difficult . however , after you get passed the chaotic parking , you will enter the restaurant quaint restaurant
4 what a hidden gem ! i have been searching for a good asian restaurant in phoenix/scottsdale for some time now ... and the search is over . first , do n't let the location scare you off . the original location is certainly not in the best spot , next
3 i really like this restaurant . it has the unfortunate <unk> in being in a really bad <unk> , the esplanade is really only commercial offices now , and is not really a great place for foot traffic and parking . nevertheless , this restaurant is worth parking in the
3 one of my favorite restaurants in tempe . i have tried a couple of the <unk> , but the republic and chili pepper are my go-to favorites . i usually order the ramen with traditional toppings , but both selections of toppings are great . i also enjoy the good
4 we had our scooter and lift serviced this morning and the restaurant was in the same shopping center . this was our 3rd time there and it was awesome as always . good service , fresh food and yummy fluffy pancakes . i tend to be a pancake snob and
2 the food is great , portions are huge . our server left much to be desired -lrb- no eye contact -rrb- , but that did not take away from the quality of the food . and the bathrooms are unique .
3 tonight was our first time here . thank goodness they have complimentary valet parking ! it is big and a bit noisy . but the food ... . . oh my goodness ! i had an amazing brisket sandwich , my husband and my friends husband had cheese burgers .
4 best pizza in az , hands down ! this location is the best of the bunch but can get crowded . has a nice bar area and is a lot more spacious than the tempe location . they also have the full menu here -lrb- unlike tempe -rrb- even though
3 we only go for brunch on weekends , so i ca n't talk about the service since we always get great service . the fajitas are excellent -lrb- get grilled jalapeno 's on the side -rrb- but my favorite is the sunday brunch with eggs , steak & potatoes with
2 was n't real impressed , the food was okay but some ingredients are really over powering while the meats are quite tasteless . the pesto and the 1000 island are sooo strong ! the garlic jalapeo oven fries are pretty bland , could n't even taste the garlic and 1/2
2 being from cali our go to chicken and waffles place is roscoe 's . but lolo 's seems to be a hit out here . fun restaurant with good service and cute decor . food wise , the waffle at roscoe 's is better . the waffle here was a
3 i 'm giving them an extra star for their lunch specials which is an incredible value for the amount of food that you get . this is my favorite indian restaurant in the area . it 's right next to school ! favorites include achari lamb ... mmm so flavorful
3 i love this little french restaurant ! it 's nothing fancy , more casual dining but it sure is yummy . i 've had the la <unk> twice and the 7 oz . steak , garlic butter and wild rice , and special sauces are okay for two people to
3 boba tea house , why are you so far away from me <unk> this is the only boba place in arizona i 've had that actually comes close to good boba . i 've had so much of the overpriced , watered down powdered crap that i was ready to
3 came here for dinner with my roommate . nice place . our waiter was super cute . = -rrb- i had the seafood enchiladas and my roomie had the chicken enchiladas . both were very good . i love that they serve complimentary cornbread . it was really yummy .
3 i love breakfast food ! especially eggs benny ! so obviously i had to get it when i saw it on the menu . actually i got the sunrise benny . this was the perfect place for brunch while trying to recover from a crazy night out on the town
3 cute little spot that is really close to my place . the decor is very modern ... its has an odd mix of sports <unk> bar . service was great . the sushi was legit . my roomie and i shared the alaskan , insanity , and little mermaid rolls

4 how have i not been here before ??? this place is amazing . the cozy little location makes you feel like you 're out in the middle of the <unk> , even though in reality you 're steps from mill ave. everyone - from the bartender to the host to
3 very hip new addition to cityscape ! wide open <unk> house type space with high <unk> , concrete floors , big breakfast bar with butcher block counter and low bar stools . lots of family style table seating and a coffee bar all in the same space . prices are
3 great place to grab a quick bite at lunch with really good prices for lunch specials . soup and salad , small pizza , or soup and half sandwich are less than $ 10 ! all ingrediants are fresh and the service is friendly and fast . never have to
2 someburros is one of those places that gives me pause . i 've had poor food here before , but it seems to be specific items -lrb- their chicken -rrb- , as other items are quite good . this is definitely a gringo place . everything starts bland , but
4 this was our first visit and we intend to come back . often . as we are on a gluten-free diet now , picazzo 's seems to be the sole respite for us to have italian . except for their ravioli and baked pasta dishes , all of their pastas
4 they get five stars now . you know why ? three little words i long to hear : gluten-free buns ! -lrb- ok , technically that 's two words , but i love them nonetheless ! -rrb- the buns are a dollar extra , but if you are like me
3 came here for trivia on wednesday night and it was a nice chill place to hang out . it was n't too crowded , yet there were enough people there to make it fun . i ordered a pear cider , which was decent . i also got the guinness
2 the sandwiches are decent , nothing amazing or special . i got the triple <unk> , which has layers of hot pastrami , bread , and their special sauce . the best thing about my meal was the french fries and pickle . the atmosphere of this place was kind
3 i 'm so glad to have a fun neighborhood spot to go to for brunch ! we came here on saturday morning . we must have arrived with a big wave of people , because there were about 8 people in line waiting to order food in front of us
3 came here for lunch yesterday . no wait for a table and the food came fairly quickly . i ordered the steak sandwich and shared parmesan fries . both tasted excellent ! the steak sandwich had big chunks of steak cooked medium to <unk> . and the fries were really
3 other reviews have covered everything about this place - it is small and located next to a circle k , but the pizza is fantastic ! i actually like the pizza here better than cibo . i ordered the small vegetarian pizza and the caprese salad to share with a
3 love going for a walk around this park during the daytime or even at night . at night the bridges and tempe center for the arts are all lit up and look really nice . on my last walk around the lake my friend and i noticed all the little
2 this place has decent food for a bar . i ordered the southwest burger with waffle fries as my side . the fries were delicious ! the burger was just okay and really difficult to eat because the bun pretty much fell apart after the first bite . the atmosphere
2 i can only rate the drinks and service because i have n't tried the food here . the drinks are regular , a bit pricey . it 's cool how you walk through the kitchen to get to the restaurant - smelled a lot of delicious steaks on their grill
3 i have been coming here for years and it 's still one of my favorite vietnamese restaurants in the phoenix area . i usually order either the pho tai bo <unk> -lrb- noodle soup with sliced beef and beef meatballs -rrb- or the bun thit nuong cha <unk> -lrb- vermicelli
3 i 'm not even a huge fan of mexican food , but i love this place . for $ 8.50 i got the cheese enchilada and shredded taco plate that came with rice , beans , and a small cup of veggie soup . it was all extremely delicious !
4 this is a tempe gem . i 've debated on reviewing miele 's because it 's my favorite neighborhood secret . however , joe -lrb- and his brother -rrb- dishes out some of the best italian food in town and definitely deserves some of the paying of the homage .
2 tried this place a few times and each time i say i 'm going to order the french toast but always get lured away but something that involves eggs . guess it gives me an excuse to go back - i will get that custard battered french toast sooner or
3 it 's absolutely fantastic to have a good place to go on mill avenue to be around other <unk> wine lovers -lrb- i.e. , those of us old enough to know better than to drink wine from a box -rrb- . the <unk> is <unk> more upscale than typical mill
3 i 'm getting a little <unk> that they put something addictive into their tuna melt because i crave this thing . the focaccia bread is superb with the right balance of simple tuna salad and cheddar cheese . it 's so good , i do n't even mind the grease
3 bianco is a great place to go for a reasonably priced dinner with good ambiance and solid rendition of mexican food . yup , there are <unk> <unk> with tastier food . but bianco is spot-on in terms of overall concept with good service and modern <unk> . puts this
2 this place was n't quite up to scratch for me . i had the foie gras sandwich . it was pretty good , but i was still <unk> $ 10 later , so i top it off with a chocolate croissant -lrb- $ 2.75 -rrb- which was also good .
4 woohoo ! this is definitely as good as it gets for farmers ' market around here . mcclendon <unk> with a large corner space , and the long lines to prove it . maya farm also has a good presence . but there were also two other small growers this
2 let 's get one thing straight ... this is not a pizzeria . at a pizzeria you can get a slice , just a slice . here , you can not . you can get a personal pizza but we all know that does n't compare . -lrb- i want
3 i have this horrible affliction where i have to go to new restaurants when they open , i 'm very impatient . and i do this even though i know that newly opened restaurants inevitably have kinks to be worked out . i have been walking by sens for months

4 i know there is a danger in going to restaurants on their first night , but all things considered i think moira delivered . the red miso soup was incredibly flavorful , and plentiful at $ 6 for a <unk> that is easily large enough for 4 or more to
3 i 've been putting off writing this review for a few weeks . i 'm very torn on noca because i wanted it to be a 5 star experience , but it just was n't . while it was very good in some aspects there were places where it fell
3 i feel that i should update my review since its been some time since opening night and i have been back many times . i think my initial 5 star rating was due to a combination of what i call the `` pizzeria bianco effect '' -lrb- where you have
2 bomberos is a cool little spot , no doubt about it . its like postino 's sexy latin cousin . but unfortunately that means that you ca n't help to compare to postino . in that aspect it falls short . the menu is n't as good ... you only

2 meh . i was n't very impressed with the bagel . the crust was crispy but was way too flakey . it actually almost tasted like a croissant . they did a good job of <unk> it though so that the cream cheese melted just right . they do n't
3 i take the light rail daily to get from my place in downtown phoenix to asu . as far as public transportation goes this is pretty good . for the most part the trains come in predictable 10 minute <unk> . i 've only experience an extended wait once .

2 `` excuse me ! '' such was the theme of the night . trying to get good service here is nearly impossible . servers would walk past our table without even a second glance causing us to have to scream and flag them down . ugh . we stopped in
1 i 'm not even going to waste my time with an in depth review of this place . the menu is generic and the food mostly <unk> - guac dip , monaco `` focaccia '' -lrb- nothing focaccia about it , it was flat bread plain and simple -rrb- ,
3 when i stepped into nordstrom rack i felt the same way as i did the first time i went to <unk> 's basement . scared , overwhelmed , excited , lost . there are just racks of clothes everywhere -lrb- no bins though , thank goodness ! -rrb- with some

4 we have tried other sushi places in our area , and nothing even comes close to yen . the happy hour is one of the best , but it 's only for two hours in the afternoon -lrb- <unk> -rrb- so it 's hard for us to get to sometimes
3 i had heard a lot about flancer 's from the `` mouth by southwest '' blog and was interested to try it . i had heard of multiple tap <unk> and other events so i was excited to see what beers they had on tap . all that stuff must
4 this is a new favorite place for my husband and i . we were craving some coffee one day and were feeling nostalgic about the drive through coffee joints in portland , or when we drove past 32 shea . my hubby ordered an americano and he loved it .
3 came here again last night since i had a media pass for <unk> march . this was an all ages show , so different from when i was here back in april . they did a good job with security , <unk> off the under 21 crowd from the bar
2 we came here out of curiosity because we could n't tell what the place was and the name was kind of cool after we figured out it was n't `` mellow <unk> '' . the place has a cool diner kind of feel and the logo looks like a mushroom
3 my friends really like this place and think it 's the best sushi place in arizona . however , i do n't know how that compares to places back home in ca . i would say for a pricey sushi place , they are pretty good and the rolls are
3 i 'm always a little skeptical when i walk into a `` authentic '' asian cuisine restaurant and there are only caucasian patrons -lrb- i guess there are chinese <unk> -rrb- . i was actually very surprised at how good the food is . it 's definitely a little more
3 i heard that this place is kind of lame , or more of a typical scottsdale crowd , but my friend and i went here because i won free tickets to the <unk> <unk> event concert and i love the band . i actually thought this place was n't too
1 i appreciate grocery stores that are small because i get overwhelmed in the big box grocery stores -lrb- frys and safeway i 'm looking at you -rrb- . i decided to venture to fresh and easy because a co-worker told me that she really liked their pesto and since i
3 my husband and i went to the <unk> jackets game on saturday evening , and despite the blue jackets losing , we had a really good time ! entrance into the arena was very quick and we all received a <unk> blanket as the free <unk> , which came in
4 what more can be said about fez ? in short it 's a fantastic restaurant in central phoenix with <unk> waiters , attentive bartenders , delicious food , and the <unk> thomas s. ! a few saturday nights ago , my husband and i stopped in fez for dinner .
4 if sol y sombra were a person , i would marry it . i would have to break out my <unk> to come up with enough adjectives to say how simply awesome it is . the inside is sleek , sophisticated , and sexy . the outdoor patio is a
2 az 88 was our last stop one evening out in scottsdale with a group of friends . i liked az 88 because the martinis were huge and delicious . we ordered food ... cheesecake , waffle fries and the blue cheese chips . interesting combination i know . everything was
2 i 've been to coach and willie 's a few times for lunch , and most recently went there on saturday before the diamondbacks game . i was surprised by how not crowded it was on saturday before the game . also , the most vocal fans were the table
4 i 've only hiked the cholla trail because the two times we have gone to camelback , we have not been able to find parking in the super small lot at the echo canyon trailhead . for the cholla trail , you have to park on <unk> and then walk
2 we went on a friday night a few weeks ago to celebrate my birthday after a rough week of work . there was a $ 10 cover charge for everyone ... what ?? the downstairs decor was sleek and sophisticated ... i thought , this place has promise and it
4 yesterday i met three girlfriends at sol y sombra for brunch at noon . i had made a reservation , but when we arrived , it was apparent it was not necessary because the entire inside was empty and there was only one couple on the patio . by the
2 i have mixed feelings about yucca tap room . i want to love it , but right now we are in a love/hate relationship . the interior of yucca is dark and wood ; it reminds me of some dirty <unk> house <unk> that i went to parties at back
3 scottsdale fashion square has just about every store i could possibly want while i am shopping . i love that it has the basic mall stores that i shop in , but it also has designer stores and more high-end shops that i occasionally want or need to shop in
3 we ventured up scottsdale road on monday night because my inlaws wanted to take us out for dinner and they wanted mexican . the sign for the restaurant out front is not that big , so definitely pay attention . the patio is really cute , but we opted to
4 ok , this review is for happy hour only . i plan on trying marcella 's for lunch and/or dinner in the near future , so i 'll update once i do . when i heard marcella 's was opening at fashion square , i was so excited . marcella
3 was out on a date yesterday , and we had worked up an <unk> . we were on the light rail , and decided to stop off on mill to find food . walked down mill for a second , and found silvermine subs . score ! i had never
2 omg this is my <unk> review ! holy cow i can `` t believe i made it this far ! plus , it was my birthday on tuesday the 12th , which makes it an even better week ! but , here 's how our friday afternoon happy celebration went
4 ok , i admit , i 'm not a huge natural foods person , but its hard to deny whole foods goodness . for starters , they have a great fresh fish selection , especially the smoked whitefish , my absolute favorite . they also have a great prepared foods
3 came here for a sub and left with a big ole smile on my face ! firehouse subs totally hit the spot . they serve hot subs , and was amazed at how good they tasted . i had the # 3 which was roast beef and pastrami with all
2 for as much as i love pizza , california pizza kitchen somehow misses the mark with me . it just lacks that `` something '' that makes me want to keep coming back as a chain . when date guy and i arrived , we were warmly greeted by the
3 i 've never been to a fez foodies event . i guess i lost my virginity here ? despite a lot of apologizing and `` i 'm sorry 's '' it was the best 2 minutes of my life ! i knew i was in for a big surprise when
1 i 've been to this location a few times now , and i guess it 's time for me to write a review of this place . honestly , of all the grocery stores big and small here in the valley , trader joes is probably my least favorite .
3 i 've been coming here on and off for the past few years , and i have to say , i absolutely love it , for a million different reasons . why and how you ask ? here , let me make a list : pros : - plenty of
3 i finally made it here yesterday and really had a good time . its a chicago style menu , with mostly burgers and chicago style hotdogs . i went with the chicago style hot dog , and it was very tasty and filling . i was impressed with the fact
3 i went to the new lolo 's location with other fellow yelpers to check this place out . i had been to the location downtown and wasnt all that impressed with what i had seen , so i thought i would give it another chance . this one was a
3 i 've been here several times before , and friday was no exception . its in black canyon city , one of the first places you hit once you leave maricopa county . its a cute little place , with all kinds of little knick knacks to shop for .
3 so , i love deli food . a lot . i 've tried a few deli 's out here , including these guys , and i have to say , i think i like them ! prices here are typical deli , but from what i can tell , cheaper
2 i am trying to venture out of my shell and try different places for lunch at work these days . today i decided to come here , since its been a while since ive eaten at this deli . from what i had remembered , it was good , so
4 absolutely love this place ! came here with a girlfriend of mine for lunch on saturday , and ca n't rave about this place enough . decor is awesome , very sheik and modern . service was awesome , and food was tasty . they have a great little menu
3 i 've heard lots of good things about luci 's over the past few years , and had it on my mental <unk> of places to go and check out here in the valley of unique and cool places . a few months back , they were on channel 3
3 i really love pita jungle . my first experience was at the one downtown , and now , i have to get my fix . i found this location since it is close to my home , and wanted to check it out . upon entering , i was pleased
4 i ca n't believe i waited this long to come here , and regret not having been in sooner . my friend austin went to the yardhouse recently , and said it was good , so we went today for some lunch and what a great time we had !
1 i came here today because i was in the area , and figured it was time to try some capriotti 's . it was my first time eating their sandwiches , so i figured , what the heck , i 'll give them a shot . the menu has tons
4 i had dinner last night for the first time at this place , and i have to say that i really really liked it a lot ! upon entering the location , i was impressed with how it was set up . clean , nice , with lots of outdoor
3 i came here this weekend to see <unk> , and it was hysterical . i 've been to this theatre before on several different occasions . everything is clean , runs smoothly , and i have no formal complaints . the theatre is comfy ... great seats , big theatre
4 best pizza in phoenix hands down and you do n't have to wait like pizza bianco
2 there is a good variety of dishes and meats , and it is tasty but the quality of the meat is ok -lrb- but you really ca n't expect much more for the price -rrb- . it 's a good alternative to your typical fast food fare , but nothing
3 nice spacious pub , and a real pub not a bar that calls itself a pub . the fish & chips are good .
4 for the past few season that we 've had steve <unk> , you ca n't buy a better brand of basketball . sure no <unk> have been hung , but from an entertainment stand point we 're at the top .
4 if you 're looking for a lunch salad/sandwich , this place is great . not too busy , but that 's good because it 's very quaint . the roost beef and <unk> sandwich will fill your stomach and the cookie side is a nice treat .
3 <unk> ... with extra <unk> . my new favorite post first friday 's hang out . it 's sure to soak up any <unk> `` 33 '' from sens or kiltlifter from `` fate . '' i found myself dipping or should i say soaking the waffles in the delicious
3 i was part of kristen 's group and for me the bomberos experience is a good solid four . despite the the incident with the log - we were finally sat inside with is a little dark and set up for conversations . the patio was nice but is a
3 so maizie 's did not disappoint on my second visit and has now earned a spot on my midtown rotation . i brought my best friend there last night for some much needed girl 's night out . she ordered the salmon and blood orange cosmo and loved both .
3 i will be honest - i did n't going into la piazza al forno with the highest of expectations . just because a restaurant makes it on tv does n't necessarily mean it will be an instant winner , but i was pretty impressed with our la piazza experience .
3 there is not much i do n't like about windsor . the decor hooked me immediately , the staff was friendly and helpful , and the vibe is just a good one . i have had the cheddar fondue twice and i love the pretzel bread . the porkwich is
2 i wish i loved this place more . i love the space and i feel it has all the potential in the world , but my last 2 visits left me underwhelmed . the service is hit or miss , last time i was there i was with my mother
3 hannys is on of the best downtown hangouts for drinks ... i hear that they have some pretty good pizza but i have n't gotten around to try it ... it is usually busy on friday and saturday nights ... i do like to pop in for a minimum of
4 i absolutely love the whole <unk> watching concept . also the seats are very large and very comfy : -rrb-
2 so i just had my half birthday at ra -lrb- something that they celebrate , where you get a free $ 20 on your half birthday every year -rrb- and it was a good time . i got there at the perfect time as it was reverse happy hour so
3 i 've always seen carly 's during the first friday <unk> but never had the chance to stop in most first fridays it 's super packed so i opt for food trucks went here last night -lrb- <unk> -rrb- because it was the only place serving food late on a
3 my review is based off my last visit which was when i only stopped in to slam a beer before a movie no joke i was about to watch 2 guns and there was no way i watching that sober the bar is a nice little bar with a good
3 bungalow seems like a cute bar scene for those into football games or any type of game as they have huge tv 's and a projector screen . today is sunday and there are games on so the place is filled with men . not sure where i am going
3 songbird is such a cute little coffee spot the interior is fun and i love the scrabble <unk> menu ive only had the hot chocolate here as it is deemed my hot cocoa spot during first fridays i could imagine sitting there with a book or laptop with not a
3 i love the tart yogurt with fruit and those little chocolates with raspberry filling . choosing your own size , flavor , topping is just perfect . yummy stuff ! cute decor .
2 cute location , easy to get in and out of . kinda pricey . super sweet cupcakes . we all discussed how sweet and how much frosting was on each yet we still managed to eat a full cupcake each . i got some for work bday party . they
1 i 've had way better and for less money . seriously over-rated . plus could the parking and store be any smaller . the cupcakes look pretty but as my <unk> put it , it was n't as good as it looked . i would buy a grocery store cupcake
3 met a friend for lunch and man oh man i missed this place . we started with the vietnamese egg rolls which are very very good . then we each got pho . i got the pho tai which i always get the rare beef adds a perfect amount of
4 finally with help of kevin v. i made my way to the mission . omg i have been missing out . i had first tried a tasting of a soup at the yelp event at botanical gardens and have wanted to go ever since . so i had a half
1 i was really looking forward to getting pizza from here as i 've had it before and it was good . so after looking at the menu i decided on a pie with two toppings sun-dried tomato 's and hatch green chili 's . i ordered around <unk> and figured
3 amazing curry !!!!! i went for lunch and was very impressed . they have a huge selection vegetarian and not and all priced very well . i got the red curry chicken with a thai egg roll , rice and fried wonton for $ 6.95 what a steal . you
3 yay a new place to add to my list of good grub and a menu that makes me want to come back several times to try out more . my girlfriend and i went for dinner last night and had a great meal . she got the chile <unk> plate
3 great name and great pho what more can i ask for ?? : -rrb- i have been going around town since i moved here searching for great pho as it was a weekly eat back home in seattle . finally i found a place within 15 min of my house
3 wow this place is awesome . thank you groupon for sending me this way . so it was a little hard to find as it 's tucked away down a side street with not much signage . do n't let that fool you though this place is a must stop
3 had an amazing dinner last night . i had heard from this place from my friend at work . i saw the menu online and had to check it out . i started with the coconut <unk> which is citrus marinated snapper tossed with diced bell peppers , scallions ,
3 popped in for sunday brunch and had the hangover <unk> which is exactly what i needed . it is chilaquiles <unk> , with scrambled eggs , carne asada , red salsa , tortilla chips , queso cotija , sour cream and pico de gallo and a over easy egg on
3 was craving some sushi so decided to check this place out after the reviews i read here on yelp . i started out with the baked mussels and the sauce was too creamy for my liking and honestly was a bit worried . then came out the alaskan roll which
3 i finally made it to nello 's and am so happy i did . laura a. called and said she was craving pizza and since i 'm the pizza addict anytime this rare occasion happens i am down in a heartbeat to go . so since she lives in mesa
4 after having ceviche tostadas on my trip to <unk> in <unk> i have been craving them ever since . so i decided to turn to yelp to search for a place to feed my craving here in phoenix . i found mariscos playa hermosa was the highest rated ceviche in
2 popped in for lunch cause i am <unk> blood at work today and needed some red meat . i got the bacon double burger . it was pretty good . the fries were not my style they were not very crispy . i love how they have wild cherry pepsi
2 i was so hopeful of this place being awesome and then i just got disappointed that it was just an average pizza joint . i had the antipasto plate and then the egg pizza . both items were just average and that 's all i can say about the place
1 i went with a buddy for lunch and wow horrible . we got seated and waited 15 minutes before even being asked for beverages . finally after getting our drinks our orders got taken . i ordered the buffalo ranch chicken sandwich . i 'm sorry but it tasted just
3 so after a not pleasing meal at another tapas restaurant i decided to go and get some real spanish food . unfortunately i was somewhat filled up so i did n't get to enjoy much of the food but i sure took in some wine = -rrb- . i started
3 i was <unk> to this place by a coupon i received in the mail for a free coffee mug that i could get $ 1 refills any time i come back . -lrb- those money mailer things are n't a complete waste some time -rrb- . i am glad i
4 i heard about this guy sarah k. went out with on <unk> . they did n't quite click , but he sounded up my alley . we totally hit it off and had all kinds of romantic dinners and wild nights . then we got married and made tons of
3 really great new hangout downtown . did an awesome job <unk> this place into a dark , seedy , yet very comfortable bar . although two <unk> who sat beside me were really upset to not find big al , pool tables , and karaoke night . oh well ,
4 i was slightly disappointed with my magic mushroom burger when i just finally tried two hippies ' flagship burger after reading about the sober , blown minds of other yelpers . but as i got more into the `` special '' sauce -lrb- probably should n't ask any questions about
1 man , these things are everywhere now . why ?!? oh right , its the huge crowds of people who are apparently in love with <unk> <unk> . what the hell is going on in this city ? are these things this popular everywhere ? pretty much everything i 've
3 i should probably disclose one little detail about how i rate my food - i do n't like looking at food that has been through several handling <unk> . i love it when you can look at a plate or bowl and see what 's <unk> it . what makes
2 <unk> ? really . so that 's what that is ... i was looking at this <unk> looking thing and i did n't want to look stupid , so i did n't ask or say anything . it all makes a lot more sense and i am so grateful for
3 `` hurts so good - <unk> baby make it hurt so good ... '' <unk> first of all , thanks to <unk> and mr. k for joining me for day of beautiful weather and damn good vietnamese food . it was everything i was hoping to achieve and for the
4 i just had the most amazing breakfast ... i 'm so excited about this place i am typing up this review as i finish my meal . my husband and i have recently gone `` organic '' so we have been looking for a breakfast place that catered to this
2 coming from chicago i have eaten at awesome teppanyaki places such as <unk> <unk> , and ron of japan -lrb- not as awesome as <unk> <unk> for the record -rrb- . we had an absolutely rockin ' server , <unk> . she may be the sweetest , most friendly and
2 i could drink their salsa it was so fresh and delicious . i had the chile rellenos , which was also good , but too spicy for my taste . the server was young and not very attentive . we had to beg to get our drinks filled . the
4 one of my all time favorite places . pastor quesadilla and bean burritos to die for . also the house salsa is wonderful . cant stay away from this place .
3 great neighborhood burger place . burgers always taste fresh and juicy . fries and onion rings are both delish . patio is a great plus on nights that have good weather .
2 i came here with my boyfriend , as he likes sushi . i am not a fish eater , but normally sushi places also have a good japanese food menu . i ordered a chicken and noodle dish and i was very disappointed . it was so overwhelmed with ginger
1 first off , tap room ? the beer selection here is lame . the name implies a great beer selection , well the best you 're likely to get here is pbr . other than the lame beer selection , the place is not too bad . typical dark dive
4 the 5 star rating is in comparison to other fast food joints -lrb- i.e. mickey d 's , burger king , <unk> ect . not sit-down joints ... i would take a four peaks burger over i & o any day ! -rrb- i usually get grilled cheese with <unk>
4 it 's pretty much a given that in-n-out is amazing and if you do n't like it , then there is something very wrong with you . so this rating is for the service . this is probably the busiest location , but the food comes out pretty quick considering
3 i love the vast selection of beer and the ability to taste a couple before making your decision . it also helps to have a server be knowledgable so you can pin point what type of beer you might like . i ended up getting the <unk> 's sunset wheat
0 i guess this is an east <unk> thing because i really do n't get it . i 'm not a picky eater and i hate wasting food and money , but i could not finish my plate . i ordered french toast and i was not aware that my french
3 love the gigantic steak burritos and the brown rice option ! minus one star for the not so friendly workers and having to pay for chips . chips should be free !!!
2 we had purchased a groupon for cadillac ranch and were a bit <unk> reading the reviews . we went with an open mind and low expectations as well . we took the kids and from the start they were excited seeing the upstairs open patio and the full size red
2 we took the kids and <unk> to the rainforest cafe after the arizona sea life aquarium . the restaurant is fantastically decorated and has a great gift shop . we signed up for the <unk> club card , it cost $ 10.00 for lifetime membership and we saved that on
4 they were kind and opened a few minutes early for us and another customer ! the staff was really friendly and invited us to sample all we wanted , of course our son 's eyes lit up and we had to explain what `` sample all you want '' meant
2 we took the family out for dinner on a thursday night . the kids wanted chips & salsa , got ta love 'm ! it is a bit hidden of the beaten path but yelp & iphone map took us right to the front door . the patio is really
4 order the oatmeal cookie , even though it 's not baked in an oven . and probably does n't have oatmeal 's <unk> effects .
2 absolutely beautiful decor . tasteful , interesting , makes you feel as though you 've <unk> the desert . spring rolls were tasty , salad was intense but delicious in its way .
3 the mild chicken tika masala was pretty good but not excellent , its sauce more buttery and less creamy and <unk> than i 'd prefer . portions are plentiful . you 'll have leftovers .
4 first time visit on a friday evening . the happy hour is affordable and delicious . drinks are imaginative and flavorful . the patio is comfortable and cozy with a fireplace and heaters . we sampled our way through appetizers of mediterranean style meatballs , veggie flatbread , and goat
4 please hurry up and go get some sweet sweet cupcakes from this great place . i do n't want to lose them !! i ca n't believe that we finally have a delightful little bakery in our own backyard making delicious and original cupcakes . the size of the cupcake
4 oh my goodness fabulous !!! lunchtime visit with my gal pal and we had a wonderful time . service was attentive , and the food was delectable . i had the brussels sprouts salad and <unk> soup . the salad was fresh and green with tiny bacon bits throughout .
2 lucky break - i liked you and will give you another chance . saturday afternoon and not crowded at all . watched a little sports action and had a few beers . good selection and we enjoyed our choices . your new wait staff was doing her best and we
4 o.h.s.o. does n't stand for anything in particular but who cares ? this place has a nice feel , friendly service , and a terrific brunch . the food was <unk> , but what really wowed us was the $ 10 price for a brunch item plus a 10 ounce
4 it does n't get any better than this . sunday morning wait time for a party of 8 was only about 25 minutes . the scent of those heavenly waffles and crispy fried chicken was wafting through the parking lot and waiting area , driving us nuts ! we tried
3 i love donuts . i seriously love donuts and bosa makes some of the best donuts around . we usually stop in late-night and ask for whatever is warm and fresh . the owner is usually baking after 11pm . i love their old-fashioned style donuts with chocolate frosting ,
3 this lovely restaurant from executive chef beau macmillan is set inside the sanctuary resort between on the north side of camelback mountain . the resort looks gorgeous and might make a lovely overnight getaway or <unk> retreat . we live in the area , so we were here to celebrate
1 this was my second <unk> here at tee pee mexican food , and this time was n't that much different . i realize that this is a historical venue and has been around for a very long time . great . the wait at lunchtime on a weekend before christmas
4 i 've been hearing about this place for several years and finally stopped in this past sunday with my family for lunch . even on a sunday the restaurant was full but we got lucky and there was no wait for a table . service was excellent with our waiter
1 i do n't get the love for z ` tejas . yes , its better than chains like on the border , chevy 's , or olive garden but its still a chain and really nothing special . the appetizers are n't bad , but nothing on the menu blows
2 i 'm not a big wine or liquor person , but i do enjoy the fact that they have an excellent selection of major label and craft beer . i also love the fact that you can put together a <unk> from the individual cans and bottles which gives you
3 a hidden gem that serves salads , sandwiches , and has a great dessert selection at reasonable prices if you 're looking for a place to grab a tasty and healthy lunch , check out bertha 's cafe ! just be aware that seating is limited and there will likely
4 my favorite restaurant in phoenix . the old <unk> style atmosphere and gathering of local business <unk> along with <unk> just adds to the fun . unlike most of the new steakhouses along the <unk> corridor , durant 's is not pretentious . in fact , i 've even walked
4 another great addition to central phoenix ! stopped in for dinner last weekend with my wife and absolutely loved this place . pulling up it did n't look the big , but after the valet took our car and we saw the back patio , the bar , and the
4 little hole-in-the-wall pizza and sandwich place that reminds me of the way scottsdale used to be before it went completely upscale . the pizza and meatball subs are delicious and reasonably priced and the staff is friendly . definitely a great place to go and they even deliver if you
3 great food , great prices and a great spot for lunch . despite the fact that know nothing about thai food , i love hitting up thai rama for lunch when i 'm in the area . i 've tried many of the lunch specials and every one has been
4 * sigh * sushi makes me happy ! did you know ?! it totally does ! me and the queens made plans to have dinner somewhere - you know ... like normal <unk> people . all we knew was that i wanted sushi and that we wanted something awesome !
4 i 'm sure this place is a great hike . however , i 've only been to this mountain for the lori piestewa memorial services . and that is what this review is about . i remember what it was like when lori piestewa was declared a <unk> or war
4 the food is awesome !! i looooove the <unk> and the bulkogi or however it 's spelled . it 's the best !! the <unk> salad is worth the trip alone !! i 'm so glad my friend made me try it because i always go back when i 'm
4 more posh than posh , capital grille is the stuffy resturant that will totally get you laid . lol ... , the food is good , the service is top notch . i can not even begin to tell you !! <unk> ! i 'm getting ahead of myself ...
3 this was my first encounter with tapas and i have got to say , it was amazing !! my sister and i got the <unk> to attend the yelp elite event held here , and we really enjoyed ourselves . it 's a <unk> drive from my house -lrb- almost
3 this is one of my favorite chinese places ! i love to take my mom here . we have very different ideas of what good chinese food is and this place leaves us both satisfied . it 's very affordable - i think it 's around $ 10 per person
4 **** outstanding **** whenever i need to `` get a away '' but do n't have the time to actually pack up and travel , i book a massage and spend the afternoon at joya . the joya spa is immense , but not intimidating ... the decor is <unk>
1 this space has great potential ... the question is ... will it ever achieve it ?? i applaud the `` vision '' of <unk> <unk> , i feel he preserved the original architectural elements of the building , while finally <unk> the central phoenix 's bar / restaurant scene into
4 italian grocery items and dinner too ! i ca n't say enuf good things about niccoli 's . lets see ... . . they stock la valle san marzano tomatoes and tomatoe paste -lrb- the only products i use for sauce -rrb- , il primo hot giardiniera -lrb- makes any
2 i think i need to try evo again ... the prices are great and for happy hour even better . they have lots of things that look good on the menu -lrb- <unk> menu -rrb- . all the cocktails my group had were fabulous . the grilled brushetta is delicious
4 corned beef and cabbage taquitos ... sounds crazy , so i had to try it ... it was great ! the $ 3 dollar <unk> big draft beers were also great ! the bartender was great as well ! if those 3 reasons are n't good enough to try out
3 i went to aunt chilada 's on a gorgeous 80 degree day in december , so we were able to sit outside . the patio is pleasant and plush with lots of plants , flowers , birds running around , and a fountain . as many of the other reviews
3 not sure how they do it , but somehow i always get swept into drinking margaritas at their happy hour here . i should add , this place has an awesome happy hour ! do n't make the mistake of ordering a bunch of appetizers thinking they will be small
3 first of all many of you are wrong !! this is not a frank lloyd wright building ! it was designed by albert chase mcarthur , who was also a great architect of that time . however , there are some pieces of work by frank lloyd wright inside the
3 sorry the flat bread is a date , not fig flat bread ! it is awesome ! sorry about the <unk> in my previous review !
4 i was here for liquid indulgences and crudo did not disappoint !!! also little did i know my bartender was the owner ! he made me an absolutely lovely <unk> club with hearts in the ` froth ' , so beautiful ! it was almost so pretty i did n't
4 have you had a bad day ? i did , so i went to yogurtini and it put a little ray of sunshine in my cloudy day . nothing like soft serve with yummy toppings to put a smile on your face . i particularly love this joint -lrb- compared
4 this place rocks ! i 've been here plenty of times before , but this experience from last friday night was outstanding . we took my mom here for her birthday dinner . we called in for reservations & to see if we could reserve a booth 2 hours before
4 we had a really nice server . the cashew chicken is a huge dish - it lasted me for 3 meals . i shared adam 's peanut butter cheesecake and it was awesome . i love cheesecake factory . they have a huge menu and their bread is awesome !
4 you can not go wrong at bungalow ! bungalow was my very first old town celebration location when i got my job last summer ! my friends and i also come here all the time during spring training season . during the summer the patio is a <unk> since it
4 we went to spanish fly for a co-worker 's farewell happy hour since she got a new job . when we first arrived , hardly anyone was there - granted it was a random tuesday night . right away we all went to the bar and realized what an amazing

3 upon my friend 's urging , i ordered the raspberry chipotle wings . unfortunately , i had them finished off on the grill . although i do like this done on some wings , i feel that they lost some taste . my friend lives around the corner from ck
1 the bathroom was funny . the <unk> were labeled with beer names . the wall said something about beer recycling . so i was under the impression that when you use the urinal , that is what you are allegedly drinking if you order draft beer . i think that
4 i love it ! good burgers !
3 the place has good food , cheap prices & is always packed . i 'm happy they moved across 51st ave into a bigger restaurant because you almost always had to wait for a table before . their biscuits are so good , homemade , fresh & fluffy . it
4 our favorite hawaiian bbq place is not close to home , that being said we were so excited to see that leo 's island bbq opened up . the food is great and always fresh , a family favorite for sure . i normally order the chicken katsu and my
2 we came here for dinner tonight and i must say as long time anzio 's fans we were a little disappointed with our dinner . it started off great , our waitress even brought out some watermelon for our boys to eat while we were waiting on the food .
3 o.h.s.o. is so much fun ! a huge selection of beers on tap , great happy hour , and a big patio that caters to dog lovers ... they even have dog treats at the front that you can take home with you ! i thought the food was so
4 in all honesty , this place has become my go-to coffee shop . whenever i 'm too <unk> to make coffee at home , this is where i go . the staff is unbelievably friendly , the coffee is made to the t , and their baked goods are always
3 i went to the tee pee last night for dinner and it was a great experience . i ordered the original tee pee special -lrb- one ground beef taco , one cheese enchilada , and one bean torta -rrb- and let me tell you , it was delicious !! i
3 let me start off by saying , i really like the clever koi . the ambiance is perfect , the staff is friendly , and the food is good . this place wants to be 5 stars ... it 's begging for it , but there are some things missing
4 federal pizza is amazing . i have been here on two occasions -- once with my boyfriend , and once with my family -- and both experiences were out of this world . being from nyc , i 'm hard to please when it comes to pizza ... and this
4 i 've been coming here since high school and this is the spot in phoenix for chicken & waffles . you have to go to the one downtown . i went to the scottsdale location and it just was n't the same . the original downtown location is in this
3 solid chinese place good for either takeout or nice dine-in experience . the staff were all very nice and they seemed to know and take care of their return customers . the food is pretty tasty and reasonably priced . we had kung pao chicken and hot and sour soup
4 it 's hard for me to give a breakfast place more than 4 stars , because breakfast is breakfast right ? well , snooze earns the 5th star because it did n't miss on anything . the wait was an hour long on sunday morning , but it 's a
1 chile , please . you call that barbeque ??? -lrb- <unk> -rrb- and they definitely aint soul food . they are in a misplaced category . take it from a soul <unk> with a southern mama , <unk> uh ... it was probably back in 2001 the first and only
3 i 'm going to keep this review very short and sweet because until yesterday , i never really felt compelled to yell from the <unk> about zoe 's meals . especially for my fellow vegetarians . but the <unk> have changed , my friends . yesterday , because they are
3 i was lucky enough to dine at true food as part of arizona restaurant week . we went during the week , so it was full , but not too busy . this restaurant had to be one of the best deals for all of restaurant week . in addition
3 <unk> ! that is what i was thinking when walking into district for the first time . corny as it sounds , i was pretty excited to finally get to try it out . after many , many months of my bus passing it every morning on the way to
3 us tukee girls do n't always make it out to fashion square for shopping . with the chandler mail just a hop , skip , and a jump down the 202 , that ends up being the usual mall of choice , simply out of convenience -lrb- and being a
4 not only is this a magical meat adventure , now you can partake for a weekday lunch ... incredible !! i have been several times now and the food is always delicious and the service is always fabulous ! i always look for a reason to make the drive to
3 now , to say this is in my regular rotation is somewhat of a <unk> . i do n't go here often , i save it for those special `` <unk> '' lunches . maybe when there are co-workers visiting from out of town or when i 'm going with
3 i was at sam 's for a work dinner with a group of six . i could n't believe that i had never been here before and i was excited to try a new place , so i could yelp about it , of course ! my co-workers and i
2 we went late on a sunday afternoon and just made it in time for their lunch specials . three mini tacos was the perfect amount of food and it allowed me to try three different kinds . i got the steak , shrimp , and chicken tacos . the steak
3 the red chile & mango steak salad is one of the top 5 best salads i have ever had , if not # 1 . the combination of steak , blue cheese , spicy walnuts , tomatoes , and fresh chunks of mangos provides a flavor combination that is out
2 there were so many tvs , i could n't decide what to watch , i settled on the one in front of me . there were so many beers on tap , i could n't decide what to drink , so i just decided to <unk> with some water .
4 what can i say i love ajs especially the <unk> or coffee bar . jason is the best . the pineapple ice tea with a slice of pineapple is <unk> with a yummy cheese croissant . i admit i usually get something from the coffee bar and bistro more so
1 i like mongolian barbeque and was expecting something like ycs . are n't they all the same ? apparently not . <unk> has fresher meats that are n't frozen - plus . veggies looked like most came from a can or on the dryer side - negative . sauces looked
4 omg i had the banana cream pie and it was amazing . it 's difficult to not order a slice every time i visit . i guess it 's a good thing for me that they do n't always have it available yet i always scan the pie case when
3 so , i had # 10 : tre-tre - 2 drumsticks & waffle with a side of fries . first let me say i been to the one in phoenix a few times and this was my first time at the scottsdale location and the phoenix location i was not

4 i 'm super in love with this place ! a buddy of mine lives in the area and i had n't been yet , so we rode our bikes on over . it 's a humongous place with a seafood bar , regular bar food and a huge entertainment area

4 i love this market . it 's my go-to spot for all things <unk> hispanic . my wife 's family is from puerto rico and i can find what i need to cook her home food here and hardly anywhere else in the city . they have everything you need
3 i usually do n't review chains , but this spot is very good . i first went on friday because i found a buy one get one free chicken sandwich coupon online . they have 5 or 6 different specialty chicken sandwiches and you can get it grilled or fried
3 finally got a chance to check out arrogant butcher with a buddy of mine and i 'm impressed . i definitely liked it better than i thought i would . we sat at the chef 's table overlooking the <unk> bustling kitchen , what a treat . the atmosphere in

4 so i 've been wanting to try this place for a while , and finally got my chance last night . let me say the food is awesome awesome awesome and the sake was amazing !!!! i do n't remember the two types of sake we had , they were
3 i had a very good meal at kincaid 's . i wanted prime rib and had never been here before . we were able to get reservations , although there was only 1 other table in the entire restaurant -lrb- maybe did n't need reservations ?? -rrb- we started with
3 wow , what a solid enchilada ! it 's kind of chipotle style where you pick your meats and toppings and sauces etc , but way better quality . i went with the braised short rib , took both red and green sauce and had them top it off with
3 great great great . i have never been but had a chance to pop in today and check it out . it 's exactly what i expected and more . super legit ny style deli . i went with the jewish sliders -lrb- $ 11.99 -rrb- . they came with
2 so we decided to check this place out . it was my birthday dinner and we wanted to try something new . we started with the charcuterie plate that had parmesan and manchego cheese , two types of salami , chorizo , prosciutto , <unk> , cured beef , pesto
2 average theatre , but it is centrally located in the city which is cool
3 so wifey and i decided to check this place out for our monthly date night . it 's a cool little spot around 12th st and oak , in the middle of a neighborhood . the decor is very modern , but warm and inviting . we opted to get
3 this was my first encounter with a crepe . this is truly something i could eat everyday , even on calorie counting !! start with savory and end with the sweet ! we sat on the side with the bar , and there was tv on showing them making the
4 fabulous ! even in the middle of my dining experience i could n't stop talking about my experience . what a different neat little spot to bring to phoenix . the waitress forgot to tell us about the specials , but we quickly learned they had them when the table
4 this is my new favorite place ! i have been 4 times now , and just simply love it . i mean i went on a saturday and always myself there the very next day , its just addicting . three out of the 4 times i 've been i
3 nice vibe , good protein and veggie choices and sauce options to make your stir fry your way , including the drink , soup and fro-yo what is not to like for $ <unk> . you will not leave here hungry and you will have plenty for leftovers . i

3 great apps and yummy cocktails to be had here , the service is good , but sometimes this place can be too dark . do n't get me wrong i love mood lighting but when you ca n't see what you are eating ; turning on some more light is

3 1998 was a great year for me because i had graduated high school . that summer i experienced good food , good company and a fun atmosphere ! why am i talking about my glory days like an fat old football player wearing his <unk> jacket in a dark room
4 this is the place . if you are from utah like me , that phrase has some <unk> to you . anywho , i walked into kazimierz for a friend 's birthday celebration -lrb- once i found it -rrb- , and i was treated to a place that had the
3 lunch was n't bad here . actually it was damn good . this review had been sitting in my bookmarks for a while , but do n't know why i never got around to writing it ... anyway , i came in for lunch with some former co-workers a while
2 it 's a scene from the movies . fancy fire at the entrance . killer lighting throughout the restaurant . it 's got a very trendy vibe to it . this is the spot for any occasion . guys night out , a date , whatever . they 've got
4 pizza is pizza is pizza is pizza , right ? and all oregano 's are the same , right ? not always the case . there is shitty pizza , and then there is good pizza . oregano 's falls under the good pizza category . and yes , the
4 on a nice thursday morning last week , i had nothing in my house to eat for breakfast . i had always seen this place because it 's next door to my gym , so i figured i 'd give it a chance . this , is your local neighborhood
4 ah yes . the good life . just finally had pita jungle for the first time . read a lot of reviews about it . friends <unk> about it . did some research online . then i decided to order my lunch online since i only had an hour for
4 i will spare all of you with my pho puns . <unk> . all of you who know me , understand that ethnic food is a staple in my life . much like a good sandwich . i mean who does n't love good meat , cheese and delicious bread
3 this is the most convenient grocery store i have ever been to ! i 've been coming here more often because it 's adjacent to my gym , and i can be in and out in a hot new york minute . everything is geared towards the single guy .
1 okay ... so i 'm giving this place 2 stars ... only because we did not have an opportunity to try the food . saturday morning ... we wanted to try out something new . we walk in from the entrance off of cactus ... and it was packed !
1 the people are very friendly and nice . the food . 2 stars . meh . my sandwich roll did not feel cooked all the way through . doughy . tasted doughy as well . the meat , cheese , sandwhich itself was good . my only complaint with the
3 my aunt took me here ! she bought a deal chicken or something : -rrb- i got a tostada good but nothing amazing she got green chilli chicken . all average but their tortillas so good ! on point and delicious at home with butter . place was really busy
4 i love this place i went here with a living social . i love old fashion feel places . this is def a phx <unk> ! i had a fancy soda and ice cream basically a amazing soda cream drink that tasted like a pie ! i love their uniforms
4 wow movies and dinner in one ! can we say awesome !! plenty of parking and the place is new ! seats are comfy you can chose from the actually table seats with office like chairs of movie style chairs with a attached side table . service at a push
4 i love the giants and spring training !! stadium is awesome , clean and exciting ! ahhh i 've never seen the giants that close . the stadium was packed , parking was hard , but it was all worth it . how lucky are we in az to see
4 best hike in az hands down i love i love it !! pretty paved trail . beautiful scenery , so clean ! there 's a golf course , tons of parking and its very well maintained . there is a bathroom as well .
4 i went here for frys free weekend yay thanks frys and thanks to laura for telling me about it ! i love this place best museum ever . i 'm from san francisco and i 'd say this museum is a mix of the <unk> and the academy of science
4 love the tsoynamis and excited they are downtown ! beautiful cupcakes , cookies , vegan <unk> ! i ca n't wait for the vegan caramel apples . mmmmmm
4 the food , atmosphere , and service are great . i love their house iced tea and their vegetarian <unk> platter has everything for perfect meal . i like to go here for lunch specials or for a date -lrb- eating with your hands is romantic ! -rrb- .
4 loved the <unk> salad -lrb- without the cheese -rrb- and my husband was blown away by the bahn mi . the service was speedy and kind , the iced tea is tasty , the decor was nice . we would absolutely go there again ! the only draw back was
4 never in a million years did i think irish food would be tasty . i hate boiled meat and veggies , i hate soggy fish and chips . this place actually has really great food . everything was perfect . the beer was great . i normally hate corned beef
2 sigh . i do n't know , but it was lacking . maybe it was that in most greek restaurants i 've been to there is an incredible sense of family . the atmosphere is usually jovial , and inevitably there is are some greek men in a corner talking
2 i do n't make nearly enough to shop here on a regular basis . i wish i could , but yeah ... i need to make more . they have a great selection of produce and dry goods , plus the meat is always good looking . we walked in
2 i met my manager here for dinner -lrb- it was very <unk> but that 's a whole ` <unk> story in itself -rrb- . i wanted to take her to some place that would be fun but tasty near her hotel , and carlsbad fit the bill . so many
2 i really <unk> between giving this a three star and a four star rating . so i guess really , yard house is a 3.5 star place . my husband and i could n't decide on what to eat for dinner last night and because we also did n't want
4 total wine is bevmo in 10 years . like bevmo graduated college , has a real job and cares about quality . do n't get me wrong , i still love bevmo but total wine makes me feel like an adult . an adult who loves alcohol and finding a
1 it physically pains me to think about cheesecake factory and even more so this location . it is perpetually busy here . they do n't take any sort of reservations . and the mindless masses like to come well en <unk> in large groups here . okay , fine so
3 i love the feel of this place . very cool vibe . it 's truly a hidden gem . if you do n't know about it , you 'd drive right by . it faces 15th ave and parking is in the back . just be prepared to drive around
3 went here last night and had a great time . the wait was super long but we were lucky enough to snag a seat at the bar . our group ordered the calimari and brushetta to start and it was good . the brushetta was a little overloaded and <unk>
3 i love scott 's . pure and simple . this place is a gem from top to bottom . i 've been coming here for over a year and food and service is always fast , friendly , and delish . the bagels are awesome - try the egg bagel
0 after a nice first visit about 3 weeks ago , i trek over from cenpho to ken 's in arcadia to get a pedicure . i am looking forward to getting the knot out of my shoulder after a long first week of <unk> . it was an a-ok pedicure
3 solid sports bar ! went here for the women 's world cup finals and had a great time . bloody mary 's were awesome and the appetizers were a nice surprise . the jalapeno poppers were yummy and the sliders were nice too . service was great and i 'll

3 this place has the most amazing selection of cheeses . ever . boyfriend got me a tasting selection of about five different cheeses for my birthday last year and i was in heaven . truly amazing variety and all were super yummy .
2 the restaurant has the wine cellar appearance with red chairs and mahogany wood everywhere . there are even pictures of wine bottles hanging on the wall . it gives off a classy and elegant feel without being too pretentious . the bread that was given at the beginning was average
3 who knew in midst all of the mexican restaurants , you 'd find a diamond in the rough for chinese food . arizona does n't have many chinese restaurants to begin with , however this place rivals the places in ca . it 's not the place for ambience or
4 i discovered this place driving around arizona state trying to find a cheap place for lunch . as a ramen lover , it 's difficult to find a good ramen place in the valley . so when i saw a ramen place , i thought i 'd try this one
3 the food is absolutely five stars . however they have raised the price and taken away the salad , you now pay an extra $ 3 for a salad with the prime rib . rarely do you find a place where a salad does n't come with a steak and
4 love this place and i am not a breakfast person . the french toast -lrb- they call it english toast with a french flair -rrb- is the best i have ever had . they are always really busy so expect a short wait . the atmosphere is fun and i
1 i have been a regular at the tempe improv for years . years and years . we go probably 5-6 times a year easy . i was so sad when they closed their doors . the first time we went since they reopened was a 4 star experience bordering on

2 i 'm still a fan . but i went back and the delicious brown butter scones were gone . as was the pastry chef . why ruin a good thing ?! i will go back as i hear they got a new chef that is making yummies in the oven
4 big variety ! they even have <unk> <unk> . if you have lived in phoenix and had the privilege of knowing what it smells like after a good rain in the desert , you will appreciate this . the smell that is so unique to phoenix rain is from the
1 this review is long overdue . i have been to christopher 's a handful of times and each time there has been something that has made me question the snotty behavior of our servers . just because my friends and i are on the younger side of the christopher 's
1 i have been to windsor twice now , once for happy <unk> and once for brunch . they were voted best gastropub in central phoenix ... i do n't think there 's is much gastro or pub deserving qualities . the food is eh . we had the nachos -lrb-
2 ten years ago , i would have told you that this was a kickass first date spot for someone that you were really into , or if you were n't sure , it was still cool because you could go on a big group date . i thought i was
4 do n't even get me started . cause i can go for a while . as a phoenix native and lifetime suns fan , yeah , i 'm probably a bit biased , but all i 'm saying is that the suns represent everything that is great about the sport
3 aside from being a $ date spot -lrb- that 's `` money '' like how <unk> in <unk> would say it , not like `` expensive '' -rrb- , they have an excellent wine selection and great service . it 's picked up steam the past couple years and has
3 to people that have never been there , i describe at as a `` dive . '' the truth is , it 's as much a dive as a place can be in old town scottsdale , but you 're still in old town and the `` <unk> '' element
3 if you can navigate your way through the thirty page menu , you 'll find that they actually have some great offerings at the cheesecake factory . portions are huge , usually <unk> to atleast two or three meals for yours truly , so taking that into consideration the prices
3 say , for example , you are thinking of <unk> around as sonny <unk> next year for halloween . it 's gon na be tricky : the <unk> , the wig , the awful hawaiian shirt pattern , the <unk> , and maybe even some fake chest hair . you
2 there are so many outstanding az mex , tex mex , and new mex mex restaurants in phoenix . this just is n't one of them . everything here feels generic and mass produced , buffet or cafeteria style . which is a shame , really , as the location
2 while ajo al 's easily holds the crown for most bearable tex-mex food in town , imho , i still am a far cry from a big fan of here . one of my best friends loves this place . loves it . and i could never figure out why
4 first off , let 's clear the air . do n't judge this el bravo by the el bravo at the airport . though i 'm pretty sure they are related , they are n't working with the same facilities down there at sky harbor . for the real thing
3 what i like about martini ranch is that when you get inside -lrb- if you get inside -rrb- , you have some options . you can watch live music , shoot pool , sit outside , and dance in a club setting without leaving the premises . it is divided
3 bust out your <unk> <unk> and <unk> sacks for this one-of-a-kind sandwich `` joint '' -lrb- pun totally intended -rrb- in tempe . wow , that was a <unk> opener . anyhow , this place is driven by its `` green '' theme and everything that the restaurant serves is
3 this is the scottsdale houston 's -- the top notch of the bunch -- and it easily surpasses the already impressive service and presentation of the esplanade houston 's hands down . unfortunately , you know the <unk> thing ? it applies in this case , as well , and
3 the chuck box is one of the best burgers you will find in the phoenix metro . the style is kick back , with wood chips on the floor and a pick-up counter , so you can never feel `` too <unk> '' to go to the chuck box .
3 i like sierra bonita because it 's something different . they present a new take on what is typically cheese drenched , heavy mexican food in phoenix 's north central corridor for a healthier , more upscale version . good for a date or , even better , the perfect
2 not bad in a pinch , but only in a pinch . i find mimi 's to be a bit ... boring . the food really is n't bad or good , and the service is equally non-descript . pretty inexpensive during lunch , so it has that going for
3 three words : killer happy hour . if it were n't for that , it 'd be another run of the mill seafood place , lost in the mix between steamer 's and red lobster . the bar is cool and may serve as a breath of fresh air for
1 i ended up here randomly one weeknight for dinner . my friend and i were seated at the sushi bar . i do n't expect the best service at the bar , but it was almost impossible to order a drink . the decor was nice , but the sushi
1 i like whiskey . i showed up before 11 pm , paid the $ 5 cover for hip-hop night -lrb- a friday -rrb- because inside they have $ 1 well drinks . honestly , how are you out of whiskey that early in the night . needless to say i
3 a local favorite sushi place of mine . as are all their locations . nothing can beat their happy hour and the red lights hanging from the ceiling give it a dark cozy atmosphere . i would recommend the mango margarita off the happy hour menu as a good choice
3 the pizzeria bianco date night : if you 're gon na show up at pizzeria bianco and wait for hours upon hours anyway ... might as well make a nice day out of it . bring the following things : - reusable cloth grocery bag - large <unk> towels -
4 i 'll admit ... i 've always seen the hot dog as the lowest possible form of meat there is . even as a kid , hearing playground rumors of what was actually in hot dogs struck me with fear and made the hot dog 's more attractive cousin ...
3 never been to cuba ... probably do n't ever wan na go to cuba ... so i do n't know why such an intense craving to try cuban food came over us on a random friday night ; but it did . enter <unk> caf ... the <unk> reviewed cuban
3 abuelos is a solid 3.5 star place , that i 'll kindly round up to 4 stars due to the consistency i 've experienced with the food and service over the past few years . abuelos is one of those chains , that if you did n't specifically tell me
3 had a hunger itch we needed to scratch , so we ventured here on a late sunday morning and let me tell you my friends ... the itch was scratched ... it was scratched <unk> well . ok , enough <unk> <unk> <unk> ... i 'll get to the point
4 go now . this is the first place in quite a long time to blow my socks off . every dish we tried was a flavor explosion to the extreme . the second you try a dish here you can tell they are n't taking any <unk> in the kitchen
3 the stand is great . it 's like a wet dream of a fast food establishment . fresh and quality ingredients , good service , and decent prices . you ca n't go wrong with their tacos or burger ; both are solid -lrb- chicken tacos are a personal favorite
3 cool place for a show . great sound . cool service . full bar . parking is not terrible if you get there early .
2 i like this place . plenty of pool tables . lots of beer . even <unk> of your favorite mexican brews . they have that old golf arcade game too .
3 it 's a sports bar type of place . the service has always been good to me here . : -rrb- food is standard for a bar but pretty good . try the wings . on karaoke night there is this older gentleman who belts out all your favorite grunge
2 i went to switch for a monthly brunch event my friends and i like to do . the place is in a convenient location for downtown phoenix residents and really close to the light rail . i would say the food was just ok . the salad i got was
3 i have eaten some of the food in the grocery area , including the summer salad rolls , cupcakes , and one of the famous english muffins . my friend ordered a sandwich which appeared huge -lrb- probably for two meals ! -rrb- i should have ordered the sandwich ;
2 i like the clarendon a lot . there 's a rooftop bar , a really awesome pool , a cool feel to it , a lounge , and they have events that seem fun . my friends and i come here for lunch from time to time , and i
3 soooooooooo good !!! went there for restaurant week , and was super impressed ! 3 courses for only $ 29 !?! hell yeah ! started with the onion tart , which was amazing ! then moved onto the lamb -lrb- which was great , but i <unk> the sea bass
2 there 's so many reviews of this place that i 'll keep mine short . the wait was long . -lrb- several hours -rrb- the prices were fair . the servers were nice . the pizza was fine . nothing special . i would n't do the wait again ,
3 definitely not for the faint of heart . when you go make sure you have your knee and elbow pads on , keep your purse locked safely away in the car , wear your <unk> , and make sure your are in good shape . you will be up against
4 i love all of the vegan and vegetarian options at true foods . i also love that i feel good about eating the food there . it is fresh , clean and organic . the decor of the restaurant is simple , and they have an awesome patio that wraps
3 i really like fiesta burrito . when my husband suggested we go here , i was a little nervous because it looks a little bit sketchy . when we went inside , it was pretty clean . the staff was really nice and accommodating when i ordered at the window
4 the herb box is one of my favorite restaurants in scottsdale . the decor is nice and calming and so well applied . the location on the scottsdale canal is really nice and there 's a large patio that takes advantage of this . the menu has so many different
4 legitimate szechuan and cantonese recipes executed with excellence in generous portions , all at a fair price . i have been here twice since my check-in and i will say this place epitomizes the old saying : do n't judge a book by it 's cover . the location ,
4 as my first dinner in mesa - i looked to yelp and found my answer . with my usual enormous dinner appetite i decided that a <unk> indian buffet was right up my alley . i showed up around 7pm and was instantly seated at a <unk> , <unk> <unk>
3 dropped in about <unk> to test out what yelpers described as an excellent rendition of thai recipes . i was the 2nd customer in there , got instantly <unk> and went ahead and ordered the beef massaman curry at a medium spicy level for $ 11 . quality was superb
3 overall the food is really excellent and can only get better ... the only reason i did n't give five stars is because of service , and on this visit , the gnocchi was way over cooked and mushy , but the flavors on everything we got were so amazing
4 wow , i was surprised at how much i liked this place and the veggie sandwich we had . fresh yummy bread , very good tasting sandwich , just the right size , very fast service and cheap for what you get . the sandwich was enough to fill me
4 have been here several times now , and hands down the best indian food i 've ever tasted !!! love it and go back at least twice a month .
0 i hate to have to do this because all in all , i do like the food here , but a few things about them really turn me off and this last experience was my last straw . we went for lunch and our waitress ordered the wrong dish for
4 great place and it keeps getting better . their coffee is totally awesome -lrb- comes from coffee cartel , how could it not be ? -rrb- and the <unk> choices keep getting better and better . we love to go for breakfast and get tofu scrambles . their vegan desserts
4 i should be <unk> from reviewing anywhere that nobu cooks . my love runs that deep . so i 'll just drop off this 5-star and continue to post photos of every delicious meal .
1 remember when caffe boa was right on mill , next to red lantern and long wong 's ? remember when they were doing inventive , handmade pastas with fresh sauces and always had great specials ? remember the variety of flavors and the attention to detail ? remember the <unk>
4 butter burger . for breakfast . what part of that is <unk> ? no reason to waste space saying what has already been said : best breakfast in town . sure matt is mean to me . and i do n't go there enough . but my wife is 10
3 the decor , ambience is n't `` trying too hard '' , it 's just actually `` trying '' - to be something other than cookie cutter <unk> , and stand out from its gilbert <unk> old town surroundings . charming old world building with modern rustic elements woven in
4 i 'm hesitant to give 5 stars after 1 visit , but i have to . eating at the counter facing into the kitchen <unk> us a real look at how much care and attention is put into the food , even though it comes out at a great pace
2 decent if you 're jonesing for tapas . -lrb- this is not a paella review . yet . -rrb- i apologize in advance if this comes off as one of those reviews that makes managers and pr <unk> cringe . i know you ca n't do authentic tapas in <unk>
3 when we move home to houston , i am going to miss this place . my sister and i usually share the pesto pizza . my husband gets the pepperoni . the staff is attentive and efficient . parking is a hassle . it 's small , so there are
4 positive : warm and welcoming interior . attentive staff . every single item we ordered was extra tasty . i had the baked potato soup and the chicken salad sandwich . my co-workers really enjoy their roast beef sandwich and their breakfast options . negative : difficult to find ,
4 everyone on yelp is right , this place is great . it 's fast , fresh , and affordable . i created a roll filled with everything i like , and so i loved it . i got : white rice , seaweed , spicy salmon , green onion ,
4 this place is seriously amazing ! i first heard about them from restaurant wars . grilled cheese is one of my favorite things and so are cupcakes . naturally the 2 of them put together would be awesome right ? i thought it would be , everyone thinks it 's
4 i do not have enough good things to say about this place ... we just happened to be on the yelp app while in the area , looking for something delicious to try . we found it ! i had the ahi tuna burger no sprouts and add avocado .
3 grimaldi 's is my favorite pizza , there 's something about the crust and slight smokiness that make it special . i also love the pepperoni , it seems like it slightly thicker cut and that makes for a much <unk> flavor . the lack of ranch does n't bother
4 the food here was amazing ! daniel our server was awesome , very friendly and informative ! the french fries were some of the best fries i 've ever had . i ca n't wait to come back and try more !
3 well , i pretty much love nypd pizza . calzones are my favorite . i 've been ordering the frank sinatra with various fillings for years . absolutely adore the ricotta and i was extremely happy when they introduced the small size ... which is still big enough for 2
3 we came here on a thursday night with a large group of 20 plus . the place was extremely accomodating in that they let us form our own impromptu <unk> . the service was great . the servers <unk> on us as a group and individually . without even asking
2 we tried the chimichanga and the enchiladas here . they were both pretty good . the chimichanga was a little spicy but tasty . the chicken and shrimp enchiladas were very good . the place itself is really nice as the outdoor seating is really pretty and has a mini
2 i 'd come back . the sandwich was decent . my rye bread was burnt and the <unk> sauce was too sweet for my liking . but it was a large hearty sandwich with good ingredients . hard to find that is the area and from a bar . i
3 voted 2nd best sangria in phoenix ... well naturally you wonder who was <unk> <unk> the honor of first . that is what we were left to ponder while we enjoyed the many varieties of soft tacos . the waiter was friendly and recommended the 2nd best sangria in town
3 <unk> new york style thin crust pizza with simple topping combinations as it should . they also have a good selection of salads . we enjoyed the dining atmosphere -lrb- low key cafe -rrb- but the waitress we had kept trying to rush us to leave .
4 well we finally got in . about seven attempts and five years later we finally ate at pizzeria bianco . i think the only reason we got in is because they are now open for lunch . we were attending a matinee at the symphony and arrived 1.5 hours before
4 the peppercorn burger is amazing ! truly the best burger i have ever had . i 'm not a huge burger fan as i prefer a steak or chicken but this is worth stepping out of the comfort zone . when you walk in it 's a dark long bar
4 i do n't know what to say but absolute perfection , from the gelato , atmosphere , service , even the little cookie they put on the gelato . i 've had the salted caramel twice and it 's wonderful , rich and creamy . but not as many calories
4 i love this place . good wine in generous glasses , always a friendly staff and the shrimp appetizer is incredible . the bread is great , too great you always want more but they say it 's still baking it 'll take another 15 minutes ...
1 the food at matt 's is quite good . my issue is with the service . i 'm gluten-intolerant and so i asked for my breakfast that normally comes with potatoes and toast to have extra potatoes instead of toast . i was taken aback when the server said no
4 we had brunch at el chorro today and it was wonderful . the patio was comfortable with the umbrellas and heaters . the service was outstanding . the food was delicious . i had the creme brulee french toast - it was <unk> heaven . everyone else enjoyed their food
3 i attended a lunch event today that was catered by jason 's deli . i was pleasantly surprised that they had a gluten-free lunch box for me . it had a turkey sandwich on gluten-free bread and the bread was good ! the chips and pickle were of course gluten
3 luci 's is my go-to place for networking with other professionals over coffee . the staff is sweet , the coffee is good , and the hot chocolate is awesome . i feel very well taken care of when i 'm here . the food is quite good too and
3 this is going to be a quick review . i love seeing shows at the celebrity . it 's small and intimate . the parking is quick and easy every time i have been there . and $ 5 for parking is n't bad at all . the sound is
3 decided to stop in here after a late evening run to the post office on van buren . do n't know if it was the time i was there -lrb- 8:00 pm on a monday -rrb- or the weather -lrb- storm coming in -rrb- but there were n't very many
3 went shopping here late friday night ... as in 9 pm . this store has always attracted me for some reason ... maybe because it seems like a piece of history or something . there are n't too many upscale department stores left in mid-town phoenix anymore . in fact
2 the bloody marg is really good . pricey , but thats par for the course at scottsdale quarter .
4 i love this place !! such a cool , unique vibe . i love the assortment of broths -lrb- if you like hot , get the tom yum or house spicy -rrb- . the choice of veggies and meats is extensive . i always wind up having to google some
3 delicious food . if you are opting out of wine , try the cucumber honey lemonade . it is so crisp and refreshing ! you can not go wrong with the bruschetta -- my favorite is the roasted pepper and goat cheese . i could have done without the toddlers
4 nom nom nom . great lattes . i like the vibe of the phx location -- very chill .
2 cute restaurant , average lunch . i had the bleu cheese burger , and it was good . not outrageous , but good . this is a good place to meet girlfriends and the girls i went with enjoyed their breakfasts .
2 the first night we went here it was very quiet and we enjoyed the wild mushroom soup $ 18 . enough that we would return the following evening for another 2 bowls . the lobster salad $ 18 was just okay , the lobster was on the tough side .
3 needed a quickie for the road trip back to the desert sanctuary so i stopped in for a croissant . well i must say their bakery was impressive . i had to have a <unk> , which is a wonderful puff pastry filled with <unk> and topped with sliced almonds
4 born and raised here , got smart and leave for the summers . i love phoenix in the winter ! green grass , cool weather flowers , glorious sun , resort wear , swimming , cocktails by an outdoor fire vs snow boots , scraping the windshield of ice ,
4 this is the best burger i have had in a very long time . if you are craving a good burger , you have got to try this place !!
3 definitely leans more toward the korean flavors than japanese . the food was very good and the provided a lot of it ! it is a very popular place and can get a bit crowded , but most of the folks there were regulars and all having a good time
0 i was so hoping to find a good barbecue restaurant near our house . unfortunately joe 's real bbq just misses the mark . the food tasted watery like it had been steamed to keep it moist . beans & slaw were just average . cool place inside and is
4 lettuce wraps !
3 good food and ice cool beer ! what more can you ask for . the chilie is awsome
1 not very impressed with this pizza joint . the hostess will not place you on the waiting list unless all of your party is with you . so do n't bother getting there early to get a table for your peeps unless you enjoy waiting that much longer . pizza
3 great bartender
3 i always look forward to their ice cream sodas . they have great daily specials too . they have good old fashion home cookin ' ambient - retro .
1 the green chile burrito was different from what i 've had in the past . they use oregano vs cumin to flavor the meat . i ca n't say i 'm in favor of it .
3 love their white pizza . their two slices and a soda combo , great value . and <unk> delicious ! the place is quite small indoors , but in a pinch you can sit out doors and people watch or take it to go .
3 mr. m and i saw <unk> <unk> and his large band last night in the ikeda theater and in spite of the woman next to me talking loudly throughout the show and wearing 14 gallons of an awful <unk> -- i do n't have a sensitive <unk> so if it
3 on one of our afternoons of day drinking , we realized we were probably going to have to call a cab anyway , so why not swing in here for a tequila flight ? we sat at the bar and the bartender greeted us right away and described some of
4 it 's a sad state of affairs when my husband and i are driving around looking for homes for sale within walking distance of fibber <unk> . we like the place that much . we went again today and ordered the mussels , which always make me <unk> with pleasure
3 i do n't even know where to start with z ` tejas . i guess it started with the one on mill , but we live closer to this one on ray near i-10 . the one on mill is great for people watching and i have taken visitors there
3 i do n't live close to a trader joe 's , so any time i get near one i have to go in and look around . they also have a few items i ca n't find anywhere else , such as their garlic olive oil that is very reasonably
4 can not love this place more ... like save up all your pennies and open a franchise and work a million hours love it . i have to say the best drink is the freeze in any flavor - so much so that in the winter i just put on
2 great small place to grab a quick sushi bite . good wine pairings and sake selections . rolls are almost all identical to each other . the cherry and orange blossom are great but my <unk> is the `` atkins roll '' wrapped in cucumber not seaweed and rice ...
4 you speak italian to me and provide mouth watering , soul <unk> coconut gelato with <unk> of chocolate in them ?! i only wish you were n't 30 miles away ... but i would walk in <unk> degree heat to get there - for real !
4 definitely a great <unk> to find both that odd spice you ca n't find anywhere else but also great prices on bulk amounts of the good stuff you use every day . for the lover of everything chipotle , try the <unk> fire seasoning , it will be the new
3 clean establishment . rows of freezers in the back . hidden from the street . greeted by name what must be one of the regulars . carries both modelo and dos equis . slowly made food for being dead . the green enchilada sauce is a must . green chile
3 with a pot theme displayed over every foot of the place , and knowing most stoners to be quite the experts in how to <unk> the munchies , why would n't one want to come to cheba hut if in the mood for tasty food ? my go to sandwich
3 fish and chips will settle just about any dining dispute . do n't believe me ? the next time you and your squeeze ca n't decide where to eat , just say `` fish and chips '' as <unk> as possible . nothing can <unk> the <unk> awesomeness that is
2 though i 've known about the existence of this place for quite some time , i have always been hesitant to visit bar smith , not out of an aversion to drinking and dancing , but because i know some of the guys who <unk> this place , and some
2 i woke up an hour later in the passenger seat of my own car , my window plastered with <unk> of <unk> flavored lipstick . apparently , we had met up with erica o for lunch at lo lo 's . we drank sweet tea out of mason jars .
4 went again last weekend with my husband . had the same fabulous server - thanks michael ! and they had changed the bun on the burger . much easier to hold . still have `` short '' fries . guess it 's the belgian thing ... do n't know .
2 if i had n't recently found yogurtland in scottsdale i would be raving about this place . unfortunately it is 45 cents an ounce and the other place is 30 cents . both have a nice variety of flavors but this place is missing the water cooler . you do
4 i love this place after years and years of going . i always get the turkey salad and am never disappointed . service is quick and efficient . atmosphere is nice too .
4 yay !! finally a yogurt place that has a kids cup and they let you use one if you 're not a kid . love the flavors . love the toppings . the only negative is that they put new product on top of old product when the container is
2 i 've lived in az for 26 years and never been here before . was n't outstanding but ok . got the bittersweet chocolate sundae with one scoop of mint chocolate chip ice cream . did n't taste bittersweet . better places to go than this place . like sweet
2 i found this place quite by accident . i went to tanzy and this is right next door . i did n't realize that is it a whole concept and they are related . salt , ipic and tanzy . as a treat for my husband 's birthday i got
3 <unk> their cupcakes are really to die for . i wish they were no cal !!! they get 4 stars because $ 3.25 and up for one cupcake is stiff . but for a treat - why not . most people will pay $ 3.25 or more for a cup
4 my new favorite place that i never knew existed . i had been to the scottsdale quarter to lunch at brio and true foods but never knew this place was there . on the second floor . right - who knew - second floor ? it is part of the
3 3.5 stars for me . food : very comfortable and delicious food familiar to us roaring fork folks . wine : reasonably marked up bottles to share . service : <unk> and forgetful . it 's new so i 'll cut them some slack crowd : mostly older folks ,
4 another gem hidden in a strip mall facade . great food , low prices , efficient service -lrb- too efficient ? better be ready to order when you walk in ! -rrb- try the bun cha - you wo n't be sorry .
3 yes , the place is old and stale looking but <unk> i 'm there i feel like being in a small town diner with all the folks that i know . the coffee is n't very good but the food is tasty and not greasy . the prices are low
1 the first time i went here , the food was pretty good and i really had no complaints . the second time - what the heck happened ??? the name of the game that night was how much salt can you <unk> in one meal before a stroke occurred ?
4 great new addition to downtown chandler . this is an upscale thai restaurant with a hip , cool interior . the food is thai and thai fusion and very good . try the awesome halibut dish . the owner and his mother really contribute to a friendly , fun atmosphere
3 it is a bit expensive - i mean it 's pizza for god 's sake . beyond that though i enjoyed the food there . the pizzas are <unk> even down to very similar toppings . for me it was about as good as bianco without the ridiculous wait .
3 a friend told me about rito 's , referring to it as reminiscent of seinfeld 's `` the soup nazi '' place . okay , so there is no surly eastern european dude <unk> at you , but it does have the whole waiting in a long line , preparing
3 attention single ladies : attracted to <unk> that like $ 9 burgers ? like a man in a suit who is n't afraid to eat french fries from a tiny shopping cart basket ? like that <unk> who enjoys a good beer while seated at a <unk> & chrome <unk>
2 modified as we know it now is going <unk> . the owner , kimber lanning , is handing it over to a husband and wife duo , and the venue will be remodeled into a more traditional gallery with some smaller shows catered to progressive and <unk> music . here
3 `` gelato is good , gelato is fine , i want to marry gelato and make him all mine ! '' this is what i sing when i eat my gelato . people kind of look at me funny , but i do n't care , i loooooove my gelato
4 quirky and comfortable , the paisley violin is like a <unk> 's hideaway . an unassuming building in a slightly questionable but slowly emerging art district <unk> a <unk> that serves unique sandwiches with daily specials , a full-service coffee bar , free wifi and live music . the space
3 it is interesting to read previous reviews of my florist , as it seems most people are either <unk> towards the place , or they did n't have a very good experience . i do n't seem to fit into either category . over the years and several visits to
4 sylvia 's has been my favorite mexican restaurant for the last five years and counting . it is my go-to place for delicious enchiladas , tacos , taquitos , chimis ... okay you get the picture . i just ca n't find anything negative about this place . who cares
3 i went here for lunch with a g/f . i had their sushi sampler and she got their <unk> roll with a house salad . both were excellent . the house salad is a wonderful mix of freshness with the lettuce , tomatoes and cucumber and the light onion and
3 omg ! i am so dragging my boyfriend here !
3 loved this place . there is a lot to take in and we barely covered 3 countries , the interactive museum and the artists exhibitions before we were all <unk> . still , we had a wonderful time ! i have enjoyed concerts here before in their fabulous music hall
3 this little restaurant is off the beaten path and worth going to ! in my opinion , it is the best american chinese food in the valley . great friendly service and the food is fantastic . tthe best beef & broccoli ever with a fantastic <unk> sauce . the
3 i finally got to try bombay spice grill last night and i loved it . wonderful service , great unique and flavorful food and a really nice mellow atmosphere . we had my book club there and the waitress was fabulous providing us with wonderful service and gave all 9
3 i love all of johnny 's restaurants and this one is no different . johnny did a great job of turning this space into a cool atmosphere with great knowledgeable wait staff and phenomenal food ! the atmosphere is clean , modern and hip with under bar lighting , sleek
3 this is a wonderful little find with a husband and wife owner and the friendliest staff around . i had a nice petite petit wine and my g/f had the bartender make her a custom hot toddy . we started with a pot of the tom yum soup and then
4 this is a fabulous little thai place . very cool atmosphere , not so loud that you ca n't have a nice conversation and the staff is all very friendly . they have a fabulous happy hour with lots of small plates -lrb- which are generous portions -rrb- for $
4 another groupon purchase , another new restaurant to try that i would not have know about if i had not . and am i ever glad that i found that groupon ! this location is in the esplanade in phoenix , and there were not many people down there when
1 want to know a secret on how to waste nearly $ 50 in less than an hour ? come to rigatony 's ! my husband and i live right down the street from here and watched as it was being built wondering what it would be . when we found
3 we have been here a few times now , and when we feel like taking the drive down here , we prefer it to in-n-out most times . the only thing they do n't have that we miss is chocolate shakes . i would love to <unk> the fries here
3 let me just start off by saying this ; this place deserves a five star review . the only reason i am giving it four was because i was so frustrated trying to find this place i got extremely angry at one point . here is my story : this
1 while driving down to pf changs down by fashion square for a mothers day lunch , we passed by this place and decided on it instead to try something new . it looked busy outside on the patio so i figured this must be a pretty decent pizza place .
3 good location , decent food . my favorite remains teh <unk> 's .
4 great quality food especially for the price , excellent service by our server james h. i have n't had such good service from a server in a long time , he 's fantastic and it made my mine and my girlfriends evening even better . . thanks james . .
4 one word ... awesome !!! i consistently go here . good is amazing and price is good !
3 food is so good here and well priced . love the burgers and pretty much all their food .
4 overall one of the best places around . i was introduced to this place when i first moved here two years ago and still love it . . they have a club section , outside bar , tables and upstairs open patio . they also have a rock band every
1 i work in tempe , and every day i bring my own lunch to work - except fridays when i get take out from pf changs . the crispy honey chicken lunch bowl is delicious and the employees are nice . the manager is always walking around with a big

3 i do n't get too adventurous with mexican food , but i have trouble finding places i like and that my fellow diners like . this place is quick , and the food is good , especially for the price . the cheese crisp and sopapillas are great . also
3 stopped in on the way to the airport from the sheraton downtown . i was giving a ride to some out-of-town guests and we just needed a quick bite . liked the atmosphere . did n't like that they allow smoking on the <unk> -lrb- `` only in the corners
3 um , seriously ? yum ! stopped in to mojo at city north after a visit to the musical instrument museum . warm day + bad case of the munchies + mommy + <unk> = great excuse to get our mojo on . we shared a medium cup with <unk>
4 i really love wildflower because you can quickly get a good meal with quality ingredients at a reasonable price point . i specifically love this store because the service is great and the store is always <unk> clean . also , kudos to wildflower 's ceo , louis <unk> ,
3 this review is specifically for my experience at trader vic 's last night -lrb- a saturday night -rrb- for happy hour -lrb- 4pm - 7pm -rrb- . my wife and i and two friends had a great time ! we spent the happy hour in their outdoor bar area -
2 as much as i respect michael c. 's reviews , i 'm not going to give grazie 4 - 5 stars just because . the last time my wife and i visited grazie , we received terrible , unattentive service , and a soggy , <unk> margherita pizza . and
3 i could n't have put it better myself , daniel b. every time i go here , i get the classic gyro and a drink for under $ 6 and it never gets old ! this has to be one of your next choices for lunch on the go in
3 when you find a well-priced deli with great sandwiches , you do n't forget it . sacks is definitely one of those places ! i just had the sack 's symphony and thought it was great , especially for only $ 5.99 , which includes a free cookie ! they

2 as far as lunches go , which is the only time i 've tried sandwich club , the daily dose next door is a better meal at a better price . the sandwiches here are n't bad , but they 're not cheap -lrb- $ 9 - $ 10 ,
4 i honestly ca n't imagine anyone giving this brewery anything less than 5 stars . it 's the perfect combination of restaurant -lrb- with great food , especially the burgers -rrb- , brewery -lrb- hop knot is outstanding -rrb- , and sports bar -lrb- just look at all the tvs
4 dilly 's is a classic arizona deli . if you have n't been before , put it on your list . from the gobbler , to the dilly bird , to the yahoo , you ca n't go wrong . the service is also friendly and quick , perfect for

2 went here for lunch with rand h. and found a nice quiet and comfy restaurant . the buffet contained most of your average indian buffet items . all of which were good , the tandoori chicken was really good . they have salad dressings on the buffet but no salad
3 yay i am a fan of cafe istanbul . the food here is quite different then any of your typical buffets but it is also very tasty . . they did have meatloaf that was real good and not quite middle eastern as well as lasagna made with lamb and
4 i love malls . i love costco . put them together and you 've got pure bliss . oh wait ... this mall is ghetto with a capital g. well all caps really . the costco may be the only redeeming factor of this `` mall '' finding out that

4 got ta love this place if you 're a wine or beer connoisseur , as the selection surpasses everything else out there . where else can you find very enjoyable <unk> du <unk> and burgundy wines -lrb- as well as great ca wines -rrb- for well under $ 20 ???
2 this is pretty much my main grocery shopping destination , normally . they have so many great , fresh , organic and unique products here all under one roof . i feel so good shopping here ... this is a place for body , mind and soul ! other <unk>
2 well i finally ventured to the south side to try out lo lo 's . let me start by saying it ai n't roscoe 's . i still prefer roscoe 's fried chicken . i think this is a better to go spot than a dine in . the restaurant
2 i must say after the mixed reviews i was pleased to form my own opinion . babbo 's was brought in for catering today . i tried a bit of everything , cuz that 's how i get down ! i 'm stupid like that ! spring mix salad -
3 the spur burger is delicious i would recommend it to anybody very fresh and definitely juicy ! the fries are delicious is well . we just happened to stumble across this place while walking through old town with some relatives from out of state . i will be back !
4 i was over to matt 's again last week . i finally had a chance to try lunch here . omg ! this place should be called matt 's bad ass butter burger ! are you kidding me it is so amazingly delicious ! i have been lucky i guess
3 a little <unk> told me i might be able to stuff my face here . yeah the bird was right . it sits in a strip mall on the se corner of 7th ave and missouri . they have a few tables and chairs inside . it is a store

3 i 've eaten late weekday breakfasts here a few times now . breakfast joynt has made even this breakfast hater a fan . it 's hard to say what one thing did it for me - the servers that have both great personalities and are efficient , the pancakes -lrb-
3 brio 's weekend brunch is not only very good , it 's a great value . brunch is all off the menu - no buffet here - and entrees run about $ 10 - $ 13 . we tried the frittata special with the day 's selection of veggies and
2 spinato 's deserves an a for effort , and might deserve more stars at some point , but they are just one of many pizza joints in n. scotts so it 's tough to stand out . they sure are trying real hard , though . first , they put
1 $ <unk> for a serve yourself bean burrito , 2 flavorless fish tacos and 2 sodas . too much for boring food and no waiter service .
1 who would win in a fight ? the desert ridge cpk or its neighbor across the street humble pie -lrb- c'mon , i ca n't be the first to make the comparison -rrb- probably 15 years ago i used to love the cpk chopped salad . anymore it lacks flavor
4 this place is addictive and is going to get me into trouble . the wine by the glass list is small but very good , when the food arrives it 's even more interesting and tasty than you expected when you read about it on the menu -lrb- excluding the
2 <unk> worked well for this small family dinner celebration . we let them know about the celebration when we made the reservation . on an early weeknight the place was busy as happy hour was wrapping up and what looked like dozens of business travelers on per <unk> were <unk>
4 when you need tamales , go here ! they 're better than the ones you can pick up at the mexican restaurants , and tons better than the homemade ones offered during <unk> . the tamale store 's tamales are some of the best i 've ever had ; homemade
3 let me <unk> the rumor , carlos is not irish / mexican fusion food . that thought still makes me laugh after all these years . i originally thought it , too . carlos is 1970 's style phoenix mexican food . what the heck is that , you ask
3 i ca n't wait to return . a co-worker and i stopped in for a late dinner one night after a work event at the ritz . we split the ahi tuna salad and a flatbread pizza with mushrooms , arugula , caramelized onions and goat cheese -lrb- everything is

4 love , love , love the pho here . i usually order chicken with broccoli and bok <unk> . i recently opted for their lunch special and enjoyed the sauted chicken with cashews . it was good , but i think i will generally stick to the pho .
2 i finally made it to the roosevelt . my friend and i wandered over after seeing the pajama game because i heard they had a yummy soft pretzel , and that sounded absolutely delicious to me ... it still does : -- rrb - the pretzel was great - i
3 i had never heard of this place and was n't expecting much , but was pleasantly surprised . the pizza is oddly unique , but in an awesome way ! the pretzel appetizer we ordered was also quite good and not like any i have had before . all in
0 i have only been here once , but sadly will not be returning again . on a lighter note , i actually thought the restaurant itself was pretty cool and i also even liked the food . both the shepherd 's pie and the corned beef were quite good !
4 my experience at benihana was truly remarkable ! my wife and i both went for the first time celebrating our birthdays , which are three days apart . we both were thrilled to have a $ 30 gift certificate , which benihana offers for birthdays when you <unk> . this
4 thanks yelp for the great option off of <unk> and thomas . i was meeting my friend for lunch and he works at the chinese cultural center and we were tired of the same old places in the area so we yelped our options and found this great little hole
4 came here the other day and i was eating my 5 guys burger and i had a feeling i was samuel l jackson in pulp fiction eating that big <unk> burger . `` very tasty '' i say to myself -lrb- because i am not really eating with anyone or
4 came here as a recommendation from mike a and yes it was as great as he said it would be . the burgers here are great , i love the casual atmosphere and set up where you pick everything you want on the burger . they have those new cool
4 i 've got to tell everyone about the fantastic sandwich i got over at wildflower ... i might have to make it a regular stop now . it was the <unk> with coleslaw and cheese . man was this sandwich great , very sweet combination with the turkey and grilled
4 best chicken fried steak bar none in phoenix . i come here only for that but the fresh lemonade rocks here too . the atmosphere is very casual and very country . i cant stand country music but its worth it for this place . it is also a pretty
4 i have passed this location many times growing up in this city and never thought anything of the place behind circle k , put once again i can thank yelp for inspiration after reading a few reviews . i love that these guys are open at 10 am since that
4 one of my favorite sandwich shops , very small inside but clean and great for a quick casual sandwich to go . if you have not gone here yet , please get it done . we need more of these franchises in the city . they toast the sandwich in
3 i came by for dinner actually the other day and i have to say that the food was really good . i had the baby back ribs and they fell right off the bone and bbq was very sweet and flavorful . i also got the sweet potato casserole which
4 it does not get any better than this place , i wish they had a location in the nw valley but it probably would n't be as cool . i love the casual atmosphere -lrb- has a rocky point feel to it -rrb- and you usually get good service .
3 my daughter has been bragging about this restaurant and i did not know what to expect . i have never had anything on this menu so i ordered the cordon bleu which was <unk> to me by my daughter . i was very pleasantly surprised . the chicken was moist
4 my daughter brought me here after having attended a yelp event . i had the lobster roll and added the fries . the bread on the lobster roll is the best ! it is just like you get back east and was perfectly toasted . the whole sandwhich was really
4 pastry and sweets lovers dream ! i had never been here before and i am so glad i now know about this amazing bakery . i do n't even like scones but the blueberry scone i had was to die for ! i also loved the red velvet cupcakes and
1 i 've been here twice , both times i ate at the bar . this place is a generic hotel restaurant . i 've had the shrimp po boy sliders and the meatloaf sliders . do n't even bother ... while tasty , each dish comes with two sliders the
3 great independent urban cafe with ultra friendly staff , great drinks , and decent <unk> . it 's a good size so even when there are a bunch of people there you can still take up a spot at a table and get into your own little world - whether

1 a little surprised by all of the great reviews here , as i was very underwhelmed . maybe i was in on a bad day ? came for lunch , and found the chinese food to be mediocre at best . the orange chicken i had was really bad ,
2 in a sentence : liked , did n't love . in a novel ... came here for my wife 's birthday in february -lrb- this review is long overdue -rrb- , and had a reservation noting the occasion . the host staff was great about it , at least 3
2 <unk> four peaks ... one of the hot spots in tempe . for me , four peaks is good , not great . i 've had some good food there , i 've had some mediocre food there . their fries are great ... it 's bar food , really
4 love the <unk> coffee . but i 'm yelping today about the croissants . pure heaven . super flaky on the outside and light and fluffy on the inside . the <unk> to the soggy , mushy croissants you find most other places .
2 had breakfast here on a saturday morning in july . i ordered the spanish scramble . it was good . i do n't have much to say . it 's close to home but it 's just okay . still looking for my go-to breakfast joint .
2 i wrote a bad review the last time i ate here , and i stand by it . however i have been back and had a pleasant experience of course the recognized me and that was a bit awkward , but made me feel good that at least they took
3 four words , my friends ... fresh . baked . soft . pretzels .
0 oh shit ! literally . i was at this location on sunday night -lrb- <unk> -rrb- and it was horrible . the first thing we noticed was that there were n't any dishes . it was like nothing new was being washed and brought out for customers to use .
4 freddy 's is a great place to grab a quick meal . it has a <unk> kind of feel , with black and white <unk> tile and red vinyl seats , but it 's fast food so you can order at the counter or through the drive-thru . i have

4 this place has so many hidden treasures ! give yourself at least half an hour your first time , so you can smell every dish of amazing herbs , spices and blends . my favorite items include the chipotle powder , country french vinaigrette , extra fancy vietnamese <unk> ,
3 i love this place !!! fresh ingredients , <unk> options , free range chicken , grass fed beef - does it get any better ? a `` healthy '' burrito ??? it sounds like an oxymoron , but this place does it !!! i love that you can pick how

3 this is a happy hour review only . i have never been for dinner . i love this place . the bar is kind of small , so you have to get there early if you want a seat for happy hour ... or go on an odd week night
3 i 've been here twice - once for happy hour and once for dinner . happy hour review : one of the best happy hour offerings i have seen in the valley , but not a huge $ $ value . great food choices that are n't offered on the
1 not bad , but not the best . i had been wanting to try zoe 's because i adored their logo and sign font outside their restaurant . great color scheme . the interior was cute to match and even had local artists ' works propped up on <unk> which
1 honestly , not that exciting . i heard a lot of hype about it from asu friends of mine but i was n't impressed . it was just your run of the mill mexican food . and i did n't like that you ordered at the counter and got your
3 such a fun atmosphere ! the frozen hot chocolate was delicious . i like how the coffee bar area is seperate from the <unk> area , i think that makes traffic easier . the eating area is delightful too because they the tables set up with napkins and silverware already
3 great service ! went here on a saturday afternoon for lunch and although there was n't many people in the dining room the wait staff was fully stacked . our waiter was very attentive to refilling glasses and checking up on us and was really nice when we split the

3 came here on sunday <unk> for brunch with my sisters . my first complaint was that the vallet boys were kind of pushy . the <unk> lot is so damn small and it 's not necessary to vallet . plus they rolled down both my windows ... my passenger side
2 this was my first restaurant in phoenix . i was taken here for a lunch prior to an interview i had . i was pretty nervous about the whole situation so i do n't remember too many details , but i would recommend this place if you 're a sushi
4 hands down the best italian restaurant i have ever been to . marcellino 's has the most romantic atmosphere i have ever seen in a restaurant . tucked away in scottsdale , this little gem is the real deal . in fact , it took me extra long to order

4 excellent service from a new jersey born bartender . jason has been manning the bar at t cooks for seven + years and certainly knows his clientele . locals and hotel guests fill the lobby on a nightly basis and the live piano playing is icing on the cake .
3 i save a ton of money on dry cleaning ... not only because i go to seville , but because i work in a more casual environment than i did five years ago and hence have less business attire that needs to be dry cleaned each week . but regardless
4 seeing that my last review was in august 2007 , it 's time for an update . i 've been back to the t. cooks bar/lounge at the royal palms more times than i can count on my hands . i even had a surprise party for my fiance there
3 looks like i get the ftr on this one ... hooray ! recently opened in the last few days , arcadia tavern took over where red tomato used to live on 48th street and indian school . the space is awesome and has an outdoor patio , spacious bar area

3 i have to agree with most of the other reviews for ` the orange table ' in that the food is great , the atmosphere is awesome , and the service is a bit slow ... slow service is the only reason for minus one star ... other than that
3 we 've seen a bunch of movies at this theater over the years , so i am surprised i have n't written a review just yet . most recently , we went to see `` the blind side . '' -lrb- loved it by the way and highly recommend it
2 sorry <unk> - although i did enjoy the top secret <unk> cheese spread , and of course the company , i thought that my overall experience was only mediocre for the price ... i 'd been to j. alexander 's before - i think to one of their michigan locations

2 i 've been to kaz a few times , and frankly service has always been not so great . i 'm easy to please in that department , a little effort and explanation if you 're slammed or things are n't great in the kitchen , i get it ,
3 sunflower is my favorite grocery store , despite its pricey side . i always find great produce here , and the boar 's head deli stock is an <unk> to skip cooking , go directly to sandwich , and they feed my raging <unk> addiction . side note : they
4 i love postino . i just wish it was closer . it 's a great place to go after work with a few friends for drinks , but then i got ta drive home ... the $ 20 deal for wine and bruschetta is as good as everyone says .
4 full disclosure : one way or another , i have only been to roaring fork for the happy hour , but the happy hour is darn good . you can , and you should , get that kettle of green chili pork or the big-ass burger , or better yet
0 their pho is the worst i had in the az area . with respect to the other rave review , their only saving grace is good service , esp for people who had not had vietnamese food before , as their servers do speak better english and because they are
4 great place for a quiet evening with friends . good wine and <unk> selections . we were hungry and gotten the half soup and sandwich combos which were all good and nicely prepared . the portions are not too tiny too . i like the ambience here very much and
3 prices had increased a little , from when they first opened . but the shakes and juice mixes are really fresh and tasty . the guy behind the counter , the manager i think would make interesting concoctions , they made something called morning dew one afternoon , with like
3 great burros , interesting creations and all at a good price .
4 this place is just perfect . the food is amazing . stuffed <unk> dates is worth every dollar and i had one of <unk> 's favorites , which was a fish <unk> <unk> sauce and risotto or polenta or something like that . whatever it was , it was good
2 i came here on a hot phoenix afternoon and sat outside . the outside was decent . nice chill decor and large trees for shade . -lrb- except the tree kept on dropping things on the table -rrb- . i tried the bruschetta -lrb- the spicy copa ... , apples
2 i like how it 's cheap and authentic . the flavor and texture was pretty mediocre though . the chicken rolled taco was possibly missing the chicken . it was crunchy for sure . the toppings on it was good . the beef tamale and chicken taco was dry .
4 love this theater and have been here three times now for movies ; the most recent being `` <unk> : the dark world '' with my friend . fast service at the box office , pretty good service at the concession stand , although my friend wondered why it took
3 really good food , but the problem i 've had both times i 've ordered delivery from them is the food arrived very messy and there was lobby sauce spilled inside the bags of food . i will have to try their food at the restaurant and see what i

4 not a fan of lines , but luckily when we arrived , there was a small line and tables available to sit . i 'm not sure if that 's because school is out or it was a saturday , but either way , no line works and the food

2 ok , i came back here with my date and tried a real dinner . the food was still good . i had the turkey rueben with pretty good quality turkey , melted provolone and a good layer of cole slaw on the bottom . the sandwich held together nicely
3 branched out to try the sandwiches and the moroccan turkey sandwich was a clear winner . nearly all the gas issues from the last review have been <unk> . this baby was stuffed into low carb bread which was <unk> in shape . it was loaded with fresh turkey ,

1 the place is too crowded and cramped inside and the happy hour only runs until 6pm while chandler 's other three bars go until 7pm . they charge more -lrb- $ <unk> -rrb- at their own brewery for a draft than other bars who carry their beer . when your
3 came here to watch a live boxing event . it was a nice experience to watch boxing on the big screen . theatre was only 3/4 full , so it was just about right . popcorn and a candy can be had for under $ 7 as well . close
4 still good , but place is too crowded now at almost any time it seems . they were out of their famous sweet potato tots at 7pm on a weekday and pineapple aioli tasted off . go for the chipotle aioli - much better . backyard bbq burger was pretty
3 even though the baked rigatony is nowhere near the quality of anything baked with cheese in new york , this is still a great lunch deal with good food . the rigatony needed a bit more ricotta and mozzarella to be a contender ad there was too much of a
2 kinda <unk> , but so is zipps in charging me 50 cents for an extra small cup of dressing . the salad is pretty big to begin with and you only get a small cup of dressing . i ran out halfway through and big dude with beard gives me
3 the way to go here is the burrito bowl for $ 6.25 . two scoops of rice and beans and chicken and it is a large portion . yeah , the tortillas are fresh , but they stick to the paper on to-go orders . i did find out that
3 quite crowded on a friday during the tail end of the happy hour . lots of big parties and some regular <unk> crowding the bar . the happy hour deals are ok , but nothing crazy . two bucks off about five appetizers including their popular wings that everybody swears
0 this is the first restaurant that i have seen that is open until exactly 9:15 pm . it is an odd closing time and maybe they were in a rush at 8:45 pm packing my to-go order because my two spring rolls at $ 2 were left out . the
0 probably the worst chicken parmesan sandwich ever and even worse chips . it was the monday $ 5 special and it was far from special . they had no hostess which already is a big problem at the door . only one guy working the bar , waiting tables and
0 just cause a place has been there awhile and it is always crowded , does n't mean its good and that is the story at harlows . alot of people really do n't know any better and stay in their routine . two belgian waffles were ordered and neither of
0 every other focaccia bread i have purchased , you can just break a piece off and enjoy right out of the bag , but this herb focaccia -lrb- $ 2.50 -rrb- at tammie was n't like that . it was <unk> , so it needed a trip to the toaster
1 nothing special about this place - just another thai food joint in a strip mall . the chicken pad thai at 10 bucks was oily and wet and was n't that appetizing at all . it was a big portion , but that was the only plus side . then
0 clearly a decent place to watch sporting events , but they could use some more food specials considering their entire menu is $ 5 overpriced . all their pasta 's are between 12 and 15 bucks , which is not ok , considering this a big chain and the pasta
4 otto is on a roll - a very big pizza roll . for only 9 bucks , i received a monster meal that in my case had chicken , mushrooms , tomatoes and mozzarella cheese inside the incredible fresh pizza dough . all of this was served with a side
3 party in the woods . this place is quite far up in north scottsdale or pinnacle peak area , but it is a placed that is housed in an 130 year old <unk> and there are mostly good qualities about the legendary establishment . we went on a friday night
1 new owners have turned this bar into a gulp ... <unk> twins bar . i 'm sure they will draw large crowds for twins games . very selfish of the owners . nobody cares about the twins and even when tourists come in winter , they are n't playing .
2 we just went over to hit golf balls because this place is suppose to have an all automated driving range which of course is not true . only 15 of the 65 or so slots are automated and most of those are usually full . another negative is charging us
3 love the size of the pizza , ask the hostess how big it is before you order . the personal size is huge enough to feed two .
3 it 's a new find for me . i went on the weekend before the exam week , the place was packed with students ... high on caffeine and loud music . the best part is that it opens till 2am which is perfect for <unk> like me . the
2 great corn bread ! everything is average in taste , service is good but you can get bored of it soon as they do not change their menu or make new stuff
2 fast food greek is not very <unk> around the valley so this is a good alternative ... not great , but you can fulfill your gyros craving here . it is a chain so be prepared for a slight lack of authenticity if you know your greek food . everything
4 very authentic japanese in an elegant , clean , and inviting atmosphere . the sushi is always fresh and their exotic specials -lrb- ask chef as they 're hidden from the general crowd -rrb- are excellent . do n't expect americanized super rolls here . this is the real deal
3 some of the tastiest persian food i 've ever had and you will ever probably have in the valley . order the `` <unk> '' -lrb- or something to that effect -rrb- for an appetizer and you 'll be pretty close to ethnic food heaven . their kebab plates are
3 i 'd give it 5 stars but the oysters were bad ... really bad . ambiance is really cool in a retro way and the prime rib was superb . the staff is attentive and reminiscent of old school american steak restaurants from chicago or ny . if you 're
3 living in scottsdale by 101 gives a gal limited late night options . i never thought i could say this about a chain , but this has become one of my favorite late night spots . the food is always good , fresh , hot , and consistent . they
2 hmmm sushi in scottsdale , arizona ... the goods - there is usually little wait , the music is good , and the sunday specials rock my sox . the staff is usually attentive and down to earth , and the food usually comes out pretty quick . it is
2 the seats are ridiculous . i am 6 ' 0 `` and my boyfriend is 6 ' 3 '' and we barely fit . this place needs to be redone for tall people . it 's not like humans are getting shorter ?
0 this is the exact complaint i <unk> with the <unk> : sunday , june 30th , 2013 , my boyfriend picked up our favorite pizza in the valley to eat for an early lunch , the federal . immediately after eating we were both feeling a little off , slight
4 having frequented haji 's throughout my <unk> at asu , my boyfriend and i will sometimes come by for a chicken shawarma plate , extra pita and garlic when we 're craving great food . the other day , we were too late stopping by another middle eastern restaurant as
4 this place is great ! i 've never been someone that enjoys frozen yogurt as much as everyone else does . however , when a friend recommended this place to me , i decided to give it a shot on a recent hot day that we had . now ,
3 i would have given this five stars if i like beef short ribs . since i 'm not that carnivorous , i will give it four stars . sorry to those of you who like that much beef . went there last night with a friend . we ordered the
4 i went here for my birthday with my guy pal . we decided to give it a try cause i have the passport unlimited card , and it seemed to get good reviews on yelp . so why not . wow !!! was i ever pleasantly surprised . i had
4 went there last night with my daughter . whoa ! this place is fabulous ! ask for <unk> as your server . he 's very knowledgeable , friendly , and helpful . i had the two corn tacos with tilapia . yummm ! just the right amount of fish and
4 like <unk> said , discovering bookman 's is like hitting the freakin ' <unk> . they have so much stuff it 's uncanny . it 's like what <unk> shops would be if they were n't filled with seedy people and crappy , overpriced merchandise ... and , y '
4 you have n't had pizza until you 've had nypd . mmm . the perfect <unk> , <unk> crust , neat and tasty pizzas , and a good selection of greasy spoon italian fare . the only item i 'd really avoid is the eggplant parmesan ; it tends to

1 hello again arizonians and visitors ... . i will remind you as alway i am the pickiest person i know and detest spending good money on bad food . i am going to review salt cellar while it is fresh on my mind . i was taken here today to
1 i promise this will be my final review on al 's . my last review <unk> them on their beef sandwich ... ok ... so heres the thing ... if you get there at the right time of the day -lrb- when they open when everything is fresh and the
0 first couple times i went to rays i was impressed ... good pepperoni pizza ... although the person making the pizza ... i later found out was the owner was rude and i almost walked out the very first time ... i decided since the pizza was decent i would
3 you just ca n't go wrong here . the chicken fettuccine alfredo is amazing . my waiter , roman is the best waiter is all the land . he 's fast , friendly , and totally attentive . when you 're treated well , your experience is great ! the
3 i have been coming here for years and i have never once had a problem here . sure , there are the stupid people who bring in their screaming kids to movies that they have no business in and the morons who insist on using their phones during the movie
3 carne asada tortas are amazing ! the down side is that they always get my order wrong . i keep telling them no salsa on my tacos . their red salsa is kinda hot so i would like to enjoy my meal without exploding later . no matter what i
3 i 've been waiting to go here - mostly because cheuvront is my <unk> and i wanted to believe that he could do more than make racist comments at <unk> <unk> -lrb- seriously - was anyone else there for that ... wtf -rrb- . but i was really impressed by
3 i was watching the news this morning and they were doing a segment on the downtown market . i hand ' t been since last fall and being that i live insanely close , i knew i was <unk> and needed to head over there . so we rode our
2 average mexican . kind of cute little strip mall and a little above average ambience . it 's good food , but not necessarily great food . i would say that it is fairly priced though . i 've been here twice and both times there were some strange smells
4 i ca n't believe i 've never written a review for this place !! this is right in my neighborhood . the servers know what my partner and i like to order and call me the girl who eats too many fresh rolls ... i.e. i go here a lot
3 i think bonnie g 's review says it all . i 'm glad that there is a place like this in the valley . lord knows this place could use just one or two real legit indie bookstores . but ... this store could also push the envelope a little
3 my husband and i went to <unk> for the first time last night . the dcor is absolutely gorgeous and you can see into the kitchen from the dinner room which is a big plus in my book . we decided to sit outside since it was so nice last
1 my husband and i did not enjoy our experience at zinburger . we wanted to sit outside . they told us it would be a 15 minute wait to sit outside which i thought was odd because nearly half of the outside tables were open , and stayed open the
4 the food here was heavenly . we got the siamese <unk> to start off with . they were very light and absolutely delicious . it 's served with a soy based sweet dipping sauce , <unk> , and what i could only describe as a curried mustard which was fantastic
2 i give palatte 3.5 stars . first off , the atmosphere is lovely . the patio is beautiful and the servers are really friendly . i 've been here a couple of times on the weekend , and i must say , avoid it at all costs . it is
4 i 've been to giant over a dozen times since my first review , and i 'll proudly admit it 's hands down my favorite . coffee joint . ever . quality and consistency are always spot on , <unk> are killer , and the baristas are always so friendly
3 i had never had boba tea up until a month or so ago , when a coworker brought me a cup one night for work . i 'll admit , i was <unk> at first , and rather nervous . the thought of those little black tapioca balls floating around
3 i grew up eating chico 's tacos -lrb- i 'm not old , lol -rrb- , and it 's definitely one of my favorite quick mexican food joints . the salsa bar is fantastic . i suggest the beans -lrb- no lard ! -rrb- , shredded beef tacos , the
3 i ca n't believe today was my first visit to giant . i took my two girls -lrb- 3 mos & 21/2 yrs -rrb- to meet a friend this morning around 830 . as many others have mentioned , the space is incredible . it 's got this great organic
4 oh my jesus is this place fantastic . i experienced ranch market for the first time last summer . i 'm not familiar with the holiday , but it 's the one where they bake tons of cakes with little babies in them . . ? someone help me here
4 the food here is worth all of the negatives - the wait , the service , the atmosphere . sometimes you just need that hearty breakfast to start your day , and palatte just wo n't succeed . i recommend everything here . seriously , everything . especially the daily
3 my fiance and his brother are both veggie boys . the brother being a vegan . so naturally , they love this place . me , however , being the hungry carnivore that i am , ca n't get so much into the food . i 've had a couple
3 texaz is the absolute best place in this city to get a delicious , affordable steak . sure , it 's not fancy <unk> , and the service is n't outstanding , but it 's damn good food . mashed potatoes smothered in white gravy with a medium filet that
1 sorry , fate , but you 're goin ' downhill . i do n't know if it 's the economy , or what , but what 's with cutting back portions even smaller ? sorry , but i ca n't see the <unk> in spending $ 12 on 11/2 cups
2 okay , so i 've been here a large handful of times now . first , the fish tacos are the best i 've ever had . so , so good . i 've tried several of the other menu items but the fish tacos are what keep me coming
2 this was my 1st visit to stand up live and i have mixed feelings . we had to wait over an hour and a half for our show to see <unk> may . when we called the front desk the girls kept giving us a round about answer on why
4 this place is fantastic . i went here a few days ago and was really blown away . it looks `` ok '' from the outside , a little ran down and kind of shoved back behind rnr off the corner , we were n't expecting much . little did
1 i hate having to leave this review because the portillos in scottsdale blew me away when i first heard of this chain . my 1st visit to this portillos in tempe , was this past weekend . i was super excited for i was traveling from qc to scottsdale and
4 in the mood for mexican and in old town shopping around , why not try barrio queen !? this place was n't very busy on a saturday early afternoon which was really nice ! its a cute little mexican food place , gives off the normal ambiance , but what
1 only ate here once . the service was nothing to write home about . the food is very lackluster -- tastes like they buy all of their ingredients in the `` mexican '' section at restaurant depot and throw them together to fool the gringos -lrb- whom , i might
4 we went here for pie -- as we had heard that they serve the best pecan pie in the state of az . . we discovered that they serve the best pecan pie i have every had in my life !!!!! my wife had the mixed berry pie -- phenomenal
3 i do n't think it gets any more polish than this in arizona -- at least i have n't found a place that does . coming from a predominantly <unk> family with relatives married to polish people , the food here reminds me of sunday afternoon family <unk> in terms
2 missed the chicken & waffles experience when i lived in the south , so thought i 'd try it here . scottsdale location 's interior was equivalent to places i 'd visited in <unk> , so that was a plus . portions are huge -- i left stuffed . fried
4 first of all , this place is awesome . 2nd of all this place is amazing . it is an authentic 50 's soda shop / restaraunt . it 's so quaint and real ! just ... to . die . for . i even commented that i felt like
4 my roommate and i drove past this place a few times before finally deciding today to stop by agritopia and see what it 's all about . you ca n't see the coffee shop sign from the street , so we did n't even know about the place before pulling
3 i had a burger here tonight and it was amazing . it was the burger of the week , with cracked pepper , mozzarella and blue cheese . i had it medium and it came out really juicy and melted in my mouth . i also like the seating ,
4 i visited delux a few weeks ago with a friend after hearing about it via <unk> upon entering , i was immediately impressed with it 's nightclub ambiance , blue lights , and the long table with high chair seats down the middle of the restaraunt . it felt ultra
2 i do n't care how good the good is here , this place scares me . if you 're looking for true mexican food , hospitality , cleanliness and attitude , i ca n't recommend la tolteca enough . that being said , i 've only ever ordered the enchilada
3 i want to keep going here , i really do . i want to drink from the massive amounts of beer selections , munch on soft pretzels and converse with friends . but i need some space . the roosevelt has become popular and that means scottsdale people have <unk>
3 i love this place for breakfast . with just a few menu choices , it 's tough to go wrong . my personal fave , the switch benedict is a tasty combo of potatoes and eggs benedict is a scrumptious white hollandaise sauce . it may not be good for
4 <unk> ! anything that you get here will be awesome : -rrb- the pickled onions are amazing and the taco salads hit the spot . i also recommend the french fries -lrb- the seasoning has sugar in it !! -rrb- and of course the sweet potato tots !!
4 my new favorite ! i 've been here 4 times so far : 1 breakfast , 1 lunch , and 2 dinners . let me tell you - this place is <unk> ! for breakfast , my husband got the tryst omelette and i got the pancakes . the omelette
3 i 've been here twice and both times the food was phenomenal . the only reason that i 'm not giving it a big <unk> 5 stars is because of the wait staff . the first time that we went we had a waiter that almost seemed like he was
4 came here with a gift certificate and got a lot of food ! we knew we must be in for something good because there was a decent crowd waiting and by the time we left there was a large crowd . we ordered the mini taco basket ... my husband
1 now i remember why i did n't go back : mediocrity . i 'm not much for chains to begin with , but this place is so strange and i can not fathom why anyone would wait in line to eat here -lrb- or , pick a location , because
2 this i will say : if delivery is your thing , this is your place . the pizza is pretty damned good for delivery pizza . especially , if you 're drinking -lrb- not that you need to be drinking to enjoy it , but it tastes awesome with ``
3 i tried this place after reading all of the reviews here on yelp . i 'm glad i did . the first thing i felt when i drove in the <unk> strip center is a sense that i had come to the wrong address . alas , there it was
3 my only disappointment with the habit is that it 's so far away from me . seriously . i was in tempe to get my hair cut , and had some time to kill , so i went into the habit to check out their menu . i ended up
3 in the <unk> for a little beef ? how bout a big zinburger ? they 're wonderful ! juicy , yummy and huge ! the shakes are fabulous as well and only because the burgers are so delish have i not tried a salad . busy , busy place and
3 delish burgers . small menu , but i think that 's a good thing . very large burgers with a fabulous flavor . i hesitate to even write this , because it can be hard to get in to this place -lrb- it 's pretty small to begin with -rrb-
4 if my neighbors , joe and craig -lrb- like you care what their names are -rrb- had n't discussed this place in my presence , i would n't be here today . i ordered the huevos rancheros , and my husband ordered the steak and eggs . he loved his
3 okay , we drive here from scottsdale to eat lunch ... it 's fab ! homemade everything , including the bread they use on their sandwiches . i 've been meaning to try the salads for a couple of years , but ca n't get past the delish sandwiches ,
4 i 'm in hog heaven -lrb- literally -rrb- ... finally , great bbq in scottsdale ! i 'm so excited ! this cute , funky place occupies the old nellos location on first avenue in old town and is nicely -lrb- but not overly -rrb- decorated in bbq . it
1 only been here twice and on the first time it actually was really great , it was n't a weekend night so i 'm guessing that may have been why . my last time here was an absolute disaster . we were sat outside at first while waiting for an
4 we had a living social deal here plus its super close to my company 's vacation condos so we just had to try it . it was delicious , 5 stars all around . our server <unk> was friendly and and the service from everyone at the restaurant was impeccable
1 i finally got to this place . the people who took me there raved about the place and are regulars . very interesting <unk> it out if you go . nice crowd but not to busy . interesting menu . food was good but nothing exceptional . the most noticeable
3 this is my kind of place . i used to really enjoy going to <unk> years ago and having lavosh and cheese in the midst of my shopping . i can do this at postino . there is a sense of the quiet and the casual where a man -lrb-
4 i have to say i had probably one of the best dining experiences of my life the other day when we went for lunch at aiello 's and for a reasonable price as well . i was quite surprised to say the least . the location would not lead you
2 tonight i spent $ <unk> for a burger , shake , and fries . the service could n't have been better . really nice people there and it was fast . the restaurant was really clean , a plus with me . the custard kind of shake was pretty good
3 this was a nice place to go and have some different types of food on a busy first friday . have n't had to much experience with the food but it certainly had some interesting flavors . the setting was fun as well . i thought my blue corn enchiladas
2 this is a nice place to stop if you 're short on time and would like a healthier option . there are plenty of vegetarian options on the menu , and you 'll find pitas , sandwiches , and salads that are a nice change from other chain lunch stops
3 update : after visiting vincent 's on camelback , i can no longer say that this is my favorite place for breakfast . i 'm sorry , but vincent 's puts all breakfast/brunch spots to shame ! : - d
2 my best friend and i visited again last saturday afternoon . the staff was very friendly , and the atmosphere was fun . we noticed that they seem to be drawing in a younger crowd than before . still , this seems to be a place that attracts all demographics
0 this review is for the location on elliot rd in tempe , however a lot of my comments apply to the entire chain . i 've been to oregano 's many times since moving to the phoenix area , and up until recently it was my favorite pizza place in
2 good old greasy spoon type breakfast food . the place has an old school vibe . not a bad choice if you are in the area .
4 man , this place is the real deal . i am not from chicago , and have never been there -lrb- other than time spent at <unk> , which i 'd rather forget -rrb- so i was n't up on what the deal was with portillo 's . great hot
4 love the chicken chipotle pizza along with the stuffed pizzas . there are at least three or four appetizers that are top notch as well . this place is always crazy crowded , but the food is excellent .
3 i tried `` the beef '' specialty pizza , and really enjoyed it . it was almost like a philly cheese steak pizza . overall i thought that the pricing was pretty good , and i liked the portion sizes as well . i would eat here again .
2 tried a foot long with onion rings . the hot dog was good , and a great value . the onion rings were just ok , they were more like strings than rings . overall i see why this place stays so busy , it 's good for a quick
3 hmmmm , interesting . such a wide variety of reviews here on yelp ! honestly , i had n't looked at the reviews for a while when we finally decided to try out this place . i had been avoiding it , mainly b/c seeing $ 15 for entrees then
1 so , i say to myself , `` half price sushi for lunch ? oh yeah ! you <unk> ! '' well , even at half price , it 's tough for me to get excited about thus place . there 's no real creativity -lrb- except for the disco
3 i 'm pretty sure it 's more than just the red bricks and neon writing that just screams `` comfort '' . after having a buddy recommend this place due to a raving review of a lamb dish , i finally decided to give it a try . when you
3 this spot is the best for lunch . drive up and there 's plenty of parking . walk in and seat yourself on inside or on their lovely outdoor patio . their quick and friendly staff will promptly bring you waters and a small salad with their delicious and tangy
3 i love window shopping . i love window <unk> . yes , i will spend my meals not people watching , but food watching . what 's great about z pizza is that you can order by the slice and choose from their ready made pizzas on display . but
4 this place does not get enough business ! an awesome spot to have drinks and get some things to snack on while you 're at it . some nights they have a dj . once we celebrated a friend 's birthday there and the dj was completely ignoring any of
4 great hh - totally fun place . nice clean bar with tons of tvs . huge selection of beer on tap . service was fast as we had multiple people stop by to check on us when we were in last week . we got a mini pizza and some
4 i do n't need to say anything other than grilled veggie lavosh wrap . jaw ... drop ... floor . and the spicy garlic potatoes ... can i please steal your recipe so i can make those every day of the week ? i 'm always amazed by pj .
4 lunchtime sushi !!! and make sure to get there by <unk> since some days -lrb- <unk> -rrb- they fill up quick . i probably get the sushi boat every time i go here for lunch . for $ 9.99 you ca n't beat it and it 's has all the
2 i tend to go more for the independently owned breweries , but i enjoy rock bottom . as with any large chain , i suggest sticking to the seasonal beers made available , as they tend to have more character and depth than the standard fare offered every day .
3 without a doubt the freshest sushi i 've ever eaten . i stuck to the plan of `` order what 's on the special board '' and `` take the server 's advice '' and it did n't fail me . at all . i love me some <unk> crab
3 oh , tasty ! very tender vindaloo , and the chicken tiki masala was fantastic . i ca n't call myself an expert in indian cuisine , but my <unk> palate was quit satisfied . staff was efficient and friendly . i think i 'll make this a regular lunch
3 great pizza it is ; chicago-style it is not . seems strange to me that chicagoans claim this as `` chicago style '' pizza . oh well - moving on . their sausage is some of the best i 've had outside of chicago - without question . the pizza
3 great food - the salsa is flavorful spicy without being too hot . the food is innovative yet authentic . one thing i 've learned is that if you get served `` orange cheese '' you 're not in a real mexican restaurant ! the service can be lacking at
3 the menu is almost identical to chuckbox ... even the burger names . i 've been trying to find out if ohw & cb are `` related '' or just shockingly similar . went there for the first time yesterday for an early dinner with friends . love the ``

2 i was so excited to go try posh for the first time . it is a unique experience and a must for the adventurous type . i am a vegetarian and was pleased with what the chef pulled off for me . the wine pairings were the perfect complement to
2 food was pretty good . -lrb- it 's no ny or chicago pizza , but it 's decent . -rrb- the service was interesting : prompt attention by <unk> and a waitress that could n't have less of a personality . overall i 'd say it was good other than
3 right up there with katz 's deli in nyc . amazingly perfect pastrami on a true reuben . excellent choice for brunch - especially since the line did n't start until noon -lrb- a `` miracle '' around here . -rrb- for any reviewers chatting about the <unk> - it
1 i make terrible pancakes and could have done a better job than this place . after reading about this place in phoenix magazine touting the <unk> 's pancakes , i was stoked to find another breakfast place in the valley to try . boy was i disappointed . the overpriced
0 i heard great things about hillside spot from a friend . i will never consider his recommendations again . the service was terrible . our waiter fucked everything up . . everything . forgetful . . messed up each order . the family next to us had similar problems .
1 - wannabe in-n-out - my burger was dry , and not very tasty . i ca n't figure out why this place was so packed . the next time i feel like dropping 8 bones on a burger , i will go to delux . mmmmmm . . delux .
1 atmosphere was meh . . food was meh . . service was meh . . prices were meh . . nothing about zupas made me happy . . and i get excited easily . i wanted to kill all the biltmore business people in there too . with a sword
0 i saw this place yesterday , while i was out running some errands . i was very intrigued . the idea was similar to cheba hut -lrb- which i am a huge fan of -rrb- so i just checked it out for lunch and was very disappointed . i ordered
4 wow . . i am blown away by my meal here last night . the lamb noodle soup has me craving more . i am going for seconds tonight .
2 plus : big burgers , cooked when ordered . variety of sides -lrb- fried mushrooms , zucchini , etc. -rrb- no attitude . minus : $ 4.95 for a shake ? really ? the fixin 's on the salad bar can look a little <unk> at times .
4 we were thrilled to see that joe was opening charr in moon valley along with <unk> 's and his awesome pizza place . we were not disappointed . from the hostess to the bartender to our waitress to joe himself coming to chat with us , you feel like you
2 skip the spicy chicken sandwich . the cheesy flatbread is too dry and <unk> the sandwich .
4 giving durant 's a 5-star review is n't really all that shocking . it 's the <unk> <unk> of steakhouses in phoenix . still , a recent visit <unk> a review . i had a reservation for 4 for a dual birthday celebration last week . the group grew to
3 decided to go to sonora mesquite grill for lunch for the first time today and boy and i sure glad i did . the food was super fresh and the restaurant was very clean . i decided on the taco combination plate which included two tacos , rice and beans

3 get a <unk> in here quick cuz ... this place needs it . while your at it get some tables and chairs that are actually comfortable to sit on -lrb- instead of the hard , <unk> ones currently in use -rrb- . the food tastes awesome and is a very

2 my very first visit to benihana was for my free birthday meal . i arrived at about 5:45 pm and since i did n't have a reservation i had to wait until about 6:30 pm for the next hibachi table that had room . no biggie i went to the
0 i like morton 's . i have been to quite a few morton 's in my lifetime , but last night , this particular location left me with a bad taste in my mouth . see i was there a wine event , and in my defense , i knew
2 i have been here a few times over the years and the food is pretty good . if it is busy , you will have a little bit of a wait , but that is with any place you go to . sometimes -lrb- but not always -rrb- there pitas
3 i do enjoy doing takeout their for lunch . i mean for under $ 10 you can get a pretty big meal , a salad , and the fried wonton chips . i do know that they use to have a little bit of cinnamon and sugar coated on them
3 i had n't been here since the yelp event last year . the chips and salsa are to die for and it it took everything in me not to eat all of the , since i call myself being `` good '' . i did order the shrimp tacos -lrb-
1 believe it or not , i am only giving this place two stars for the fabulous company i was with and the decent food however the service left alot to be desired . otherwise it gets a zero ! so after arriving -lrb- albeit i was a little late by

4 this is one of my favorite places to eat in phoenix , even though i do n't get over here as often as i 'd like . first of all , the interior is stunning . i love coming here when the weather is nice enough that the opened windows
3 the food keeps me coming back again and again . the new york roll is my favorite - spicy tuna topped with the <unk> avocado , eel sauce and crunch tempura flakes . one of our party got the sashimi boat and the cuts were thick and fresh . even
1 the `` chicken burger '' with jerk sauce was gross . it was dried out with terrible flavor . the only saving grace was that it was small , which says enough right there . as another reviewed said , it was a ground chicken patty when i was expecting
0 this place made me <unk> -lrb- sad + angry -rrb- . i really wanted to like it as an italian who works right around the corner . went here with my work team for lunch on a friday and the service was so slow i missed my regular <unk> meeting
3 stopped at urban cookies today for an after lunch snack with a coworker . it is an adorable tiny little shop with awesome cookies in giant glass jars . i tried the <unk> and it was delicious ... but i am a chocolate lover so it is really not hard
3 went to lucky strike in phoenix for the second time after my wedding reception last month ... yes i bowled in my wedding dress ! the staff was wonderful . they gave everyone in our party free shoe rentals and they game me a free dessert . the drink specials

3 first visit . early lunch <unk> am on a thursday . sampled moist and regular brisket and smoked turkey . ordered moist brisket sandwich , slaw & potato salad . the brisket was moist . they do it right . melts in your mouth and you can basically chew it
3 went here for happy hour to meet some people from work on a thursday night . great happy hour specials . younger crowd . food was very good . we had several appetizers at the table and a couple of rolls . sushi quality was very good and they do
3 been several times . always good . one time i went for lunch and the grill was broken . we had to wait for them to repair it and that took about 30 minutes before the burgers started coming out . it was still worth the wait .
3 for a quick fix for mexican food i love caramba . i <unk> get the pollo fundido and cheese crisp . this time i added the the caramba special - a ginormous burrito to eat the next day . as usual , it was good . the restaurant is always
3 i 'm guessing they turned this place around again , based on previous reviews . we went here the other morning and it was great . awesome , friendly barista , and a good atmosphere overall . nice places to sit both inside and outside . i think the most
1 it 's like hooters , kind of . or at least i think that 's what their going for . food - not bad drinks - standard bar atmosphere - ok for a sports bar downtown , lots of tvs service - yeah right . you 'll need to head
4 a new phoenix favorite . independent movies ? check awesome beer selection ? check cool drinking atmosphere ? check byo food into the theater ? oh yeah check out the `` membership '' for cheaper movies , all day happy hour , free popcorn , etc. .
4 rip 's has become our favorite neighborhood bar for a few reasons . the first and most important being karaoke . there 's a reason it was voted best in the valley -lrb- new times ' 11 -rrb- . karaoke is usually pretty terrible , but not at rip 's
4 top choice for pizza in the biltmore area for sure . so good ! the ambiance is great , perfect for a date or small group . this is the kind of place where you want to order a bottle of wine and an appetizer , hang out for a
2 really , guy ? so i guess if it 's featured by fieri you have to go , and you have to love it , right ? this is coming from the guy who plans <unk> road trips to get my lips on some of the food i see <unk>
4 winner . you want healthy ? you got it . you want vegetarian/vegan ? you got it . you want your food to taste amazing ? you got it . service ? you guessed it . a spicy cha cha might sound like something you might want to avoid ,

3 it 's all about the package . 3.5 stars . at the restaurant pepin , of course . i would not give them 4 stars based solely on the food . 3 stars for the food . it was for the most part very good but not good enough to
2 overall i enjoyed the food , service and atmosphere here , but they fell short of 4 stars for me . we were served in somewhat of a <unk> style , there were probably 3-4 different people waiting on us . i thought that was a bit unusual . the

3 wally 's bills itself as a neighborhood grill - it 's in our neighborhood so we like to frequent it . the food is good and the portion sizes are enough to take some home and have the next day . i tried the french dip with prime rib for

4 i 'm not a big fan of the fox concepts restaurants , but his new venture at 40th <unk> is wonderful ! it is billed as having a rustic , farmhouse atmosphere - i guess that explains the blue jeans and plaid , <unk> shirts on the servers -lrb- really
4 i love this place . the review about them being angry i 've never seen . they were some of the nicest people i 've met . when i said something about wanting more vegetarian options the reply was `` we 'll make it work ! just let us know
0 this place ... oh my ... well if you 're a vegetarian ... run . i got stuck at this place due to a corporate event my company hosted there . let me say , how excited i was at the idea of mexican food at the christmas party .
3 cafe review i can see why raw <unk> adore this place . it has a lot to offer . if you are huge into vegetables , raw foods , fresh tea this is a fantastic place for you . its about a fresh as fresh can get , and tastes

4 i am stunned to find a poor review of this place . i discovered this place after i started my current job ; the office is down the street and for the last 5 years i 've eaten here at least 100 times . the location is downright bad ,
3 we live down the street and anxiously awaited the <unk> of this place . already stoked to have lola within walking distance , i must admit i was less than thrilled to learn it was a `` tiki bar '' . while walking the dog , we turned into the

3 not the best burger i 've ever had ... but it was really good ! i hit up the stand for lunch and received quick , helpful service . the girl at the counter made suggestions since i had never been there before ... and she was spot on .
2 given the choice , i would give stingray 3.5 stars for this dining experience . sushi is good ... but not great . i always rate my sushi experiences based on the <unk> of the rolls , freshness of ingredients , and taste of some of the more complicated rolls

2 north is the <unk> <unk> of italian restaurants . it is expertly executed but it lacks an authenticity that you want in your local trattoria , an authenticity that really comes through in other local spots like <unk> , veneto , franco 's or pomo . that does n't mean
3 quintessential and kitschy old-school arizona . the food , while old-school mexican , is actually decent and props for offering fideo . i 'm willing to overlook the fact that it can smell like cats or my grandma 's place because of the building 's pretty interesting history .
2 love the fuego bistro , have high hopes for this place . unfortunately the place has two <unk> to overcome . first , the esplanade is a dead space in terms of retail . just ask picazzo 's and their failed two month experiment . second , for as much

3 you ca n't beat the price for the quality . if you 're looking for upscale and expensive , go to scottsdale . otherwise if you want <unk> and good swing by texaz . the <unk> 's filet is awesome !
0 this place is a staple lunch spot for us . i have rated this place highly before . today an order mix up became a very uncomfortable situation . really too bad .
4 a great variety of food on the buffet . very good to get a sample many indian dishes , if you are not familiar . many may be spicy to some uninitiated palates .
2 great service . gyro <unk> was a fine pita sandwich , very few jalapeos in the mix , heavier on the green bell peppers . will try another sandwich if i come back .

3 my 4-star review is based solely on terminal 4 . terminal 3 might be worthy of 3 stars , although it 's been years since i 've used it , terminal 2 is definitely only worth 2 stars , and terminal 1 probably only gets 1 star for being either
1 not a fan , but i keep coming back due to old habits ... the previous coffee shop in this location was excellent . this one has mediocre coffee and a very slow internet connection . not a good combo if you want <unk> customers .
3 once you work your way through the `` ghetto '' downstairs , you 'll be met with fresh air , cool music , and a nice view overlooking cityscape and the us airways arena on the roof of <unk> ! an intimate -lrb- small -rrb- setting , <unk> plays host

3 great burgers with brioche buns , great onion strings . you can also <unk> the bun and do a burger on a salad . clean decor and good servers . not the cheapest burger , but certainly a good one .
3 short ribs were excellent , along with chipotle mashed potatoes . a little hard to find , but worth it .
2 this place has had great reviews , but do n't get overly excited . this is good bbq , but nothing exceptional . nothing unusual here .

3 apparently this is a california staple , and it just opened here in the valley . via a friend , we popped in after dinner last night . our friend was having a difficult time explaining the texture of this new <unk> ice treat , we just had to experience
3 i always feel so high brow and <unk> when i go to trader joes , even though i 'm wearing cut-off flip flops , surrounded by louis <unk> <unk> desperate <unk> . actually , i was following my wife around the store like the good husband i am . we
3 it was actually raining at our house on saturday . that never happens . so instead of staying in , we headed over to fashion square to catch a movie . it 's a small theater but they offer the latest releases . we arrived early to catch a <unk>
4 i think this food is phenomenal . this was the first place i tried asian food in az when moving out here years ago . it has grown since then and the food is always top notch . for a late sunday afternoon lunch , the place was nearly empty
3 we 've been wanting to eat here for some time , and last night we had a very good experience . we made it in for their daily happy hour specials and got several drinks , an app , and 2 entrees for under 40 bucks , including tip .
3 we checked this place out for a sunday happy hour yesterday . very cool decor , on the hot spot that is the light rail in cenpho -lrb- which is like saying `` scotts '' or `` <unk> '' or `` the <unk> '' ... i hate trendy -rrb- .
4 yes , she was here ! julia baker herself . do n't know her ? me neither ... and then i met her and tasted the goodies she makes , and now i will never forget her . even more impressive was that she was so normal ! like a
3 this is our go-to work happy hour spot ... it 's close to the hospital -lrb- do n't know if that 's a good or bad thing -rrb- and they have really good happy hour specials . everyday of the week they offer a food and/or drink special . i
1 i have to agree with my wife . the place is big , but they pack you in like freaking sardines . our table was probably a <unk> foot table and were rubbing shoulders with couples on either side and behind us . the validated parking is considerate . but
3 our first stop on a bike pub ride . i 've been here before and it feels like a bar . it 's not crowded , there is not <unk> music playing . there is a pool table and lots of oak . it 's a place for sitting at
4 we 've been `` trying '' to catch this place for a while . if we go out for breakfast , it 's usually on a sunday , and by the time we realized that essence bakery is n't open on sundays , we are forced to head back to
4 i ca n't believe how age and wear and tear grind on the body . i use to be able to do this , i thought , much better ! i had an online coupon so i took my wife for some indoor rock climbing . she had never been
4 this place has been on the list for years , and finally after getting our act together , we met another couple for a dinner at olive and ivy . the decor , in traditional fox style , is perfect . from the lights to the tile to the bathroom
3 the happy hour here is the best in town . the food quality is top notch and the drinks are stiff . plus , there 's something cool about cheap happy hour in such a nice place . only eaten off the regular menu once , and the food was
4 this was our first visit here . we arrived just at the end of happy hour , so our really cool server kept saying `` ok , you have about 2 minutes before happy hour is over '' and we were able to get a couple of drinks and rolls
3 day drinking in scottsdale is a past time i have not appreciated enough . on this wonderfully cool afternoon , we were walking home and a friend in our group says `` hey , you want to get a drink '' . how novel ... it was kinda quiet ,
2 extremely cool spot . polynesian , trendy , contemporary , retro ... and full of <unk> `` mature couples '' , extremely hair <unk> scottsdale dudes , and giant <unk> , ultra <unk> scottsdale girls . i fit right in with my old <unk> wear ... i havent ' had
3 i lived in san luis <unk> for a few months and they have one of the best weekly , outdoor farmers markets i 've ever been to -lrb- in the u.s. anyway -rrb- ... and not counting the <unk> farmers market in atlanta . the <unk> market had tons of
4 after another 2 weekends of somewhat gluttonous living , we had to come here to get our greens fix . i just love this place . the greens and fixins are so fresh . and they try to update every now and then so that you have squash or beets
0 do n't eat here ! looked nice from the outside . there were over 12 empty tables , 2 couples waiting , and still we were told it would be a 25 minute wait . decided to have a drink at the bar . we were the only 2 people
4 excellent service this go around ! our waitress <unk> on us and our pooch patio side it made me forget the mediocre service i 've had here in the past . coffee , water , and food was all brought out quickly and with a smile . i had the
4 we ended our restaurant week experiences with a <unk> meal at province . oh how happy . the restaurant is absolutely beautiful . very modern with clean lines and impeccable organization . we tried to sit outside , but it was still way too hot and they easily accommodated us
3 while my daughter was attending a birthday party across the street , a couple of the dads and i decided to escape the <unk> affair by grabbing lunch and some drinks at sol . when i walked in , i was very impressed with the vibe . it 's dimly
2 rating this place could go any number of ways , depending on where you sit . due to the <unk> way in which we entered , we managed to experience a little bit of everything here . my wife and i agreed to meet the in-laws here on a friday
4 in exchange for watching our little one , my in-laws proposed that we meet up at crackers & co to make the switch . a new breakfast place and we get a date day ? i 'm game ! when we first arrived , i was a little skeptical .
1 pretty much done with nello 's ahwatukee ... it is now the parlor - part ii wannabe they have killed what used to be really good pizza - no one , and i mean no one there can make a pizza like george used to . what a shame and
3 ok , as of <unk> they may be back on track at nello 's ahwatukee ! went there this past week and had a great experience -lrb- as in the past -rrb- . pizza was cut in squares again and had a great <unk> salad . the owner was making
2 i 'll give roka credit , the must have read my review , offered to make the next visit a better experience and offered a gift card , so i 'll give them another try . hoping for another <unk> experience again .
2 cool place , comfortable . sorely needed in the ` tuke . went for lunch today . slow ordering process and a bit crowded with food items on shelves right behind the ordering line ... need to move that stuff and free up space for people to comfortably read the
2 the chaos and the `` no-frills '' ambiance in this place reminds me of <unk> in los angeles , but the service does not . being pretty busy on a weekend night , one had to literally walk over to someone to get banchan and even pay for the bill
4 for our anniversary my wife and i decided to try the mission to see it would live up to the hype . first impression when walking through the door is that it was a bit loud . but it being a friday night we were necessarily surprised . had made
3 first off , the place is cheap . burritos run around $ 4 . plates with rice and beans a $ 1-2 more . the mexican food is <unk> with other hole-in-the-wall joints from california that i grew up on loving . quality flavorful carne asada but a bit on
2 the service here is great . at least while sitting at the bar it is . the food is good and the beers are good . the have a very nice selection of drafts which is great . i usually try a different house beer every time i 'm there
3 this place has great food , great service and is in a great location . the lunch specials are a good deal , but if your eating and drinking here for dinner your tab will be pretty high . just make sure you check the beer and wine prices before
2 beer , beer , beer , wow ! what a great selection . i really love the fact this place has so many different beers to try . they even have these things called flights where you can get 4 5 ounce beers for $ 8 . not to shabby
3 this place is old school great . classic tavern . cheap drinks and no <unk> stuff . not a great selection of liquor but they have the basics . surprisingly they have stella artois on tap . of course many of patrons were drinking pbr the night i was there
3 very , very hip , trendy place to hang out . they have it all here . great place for families and hipsters alike . the shopping looks really cool with vintage clothing galore . the pf flyers were especially interesting . tried the <unk> pack of sliders , brisket
3 i have been going to this hard to find place for years . it was recommended by a friend from the frist moment i bit into the crispy crust i was hooked . i will talk about the food in a moment but my favorite part of classic italian is
3 uncle sam 's is getting four stars from me specifically for its happy hour . everything here is at least as good as you 'd expect from a divey pizza joint staffed by chicks in short skirts . not my thing , but they were nice enough and i had
4 my meal at fnb last weekend was one of the best i 've had in arizona . i love everything about this place , the food , the cocktails , the staff , the atmosphere . it was a rainy sunday . i knew the restaurant was right next to
3 liberty market is a great place to meet friends or family for a good , casual meal . the work that has been put into this space has payed off , and the pride the owners take in their business is evident . i 've been here four times ,
2 delish , but overpriced for a burger joint .
3 oh matt , <unk> , <unk> did you have to move ? who cares that your old place was small ? it was part of the quaint location . no matter ... your food is still worth waiting in the beaming heat . keep it up with the ` no
3 pleasantly surprised by this hidden spot in a quiet shopping center . almost across the street from the <unk> . owner is very informative . more smiling faces and street advertising would help . has a <unk> atmosphere . unsure of free wifi , would be great though . been
2 i 'd heard of this place time and time again . so i finally thought i 'd give it a whirl . when you 're driving there from the <unk> , you think you 're in the wrong place : industrial , low income homes , etc. . but when
1 and again , i 've given it another try but still a bit disappointed . oh well , it 's something to do on rainy days . i do so enjoy the <unk> room . and the snack room is great , minus some of the pricing .
2 good customer service , clean , yummy fresh food ... guess that 's why it 's a wait for the food downer : no smiling faces behind the counter . no free wifi , although it says it does on site . * location is kinda hidden from ray rd
3 it 's a nice place to relax and chit chat with friends , or just come to enjoy a nice cup of coffee and a good book . i will definitely come back and try their latte : -rrb-
3 i will definitely come back to this place when am craving for good pad thai . i have to say so far the best in phoenix .
4 i am in love with the cinema suite ! being able to stretch out your legs on the <unk> recliner is the way to enjoy the movie . the chair is spacious and the room is not crowded with <unk> . the foods are at a reasonable price and the
3 i really like lgo . i go here very often as i have my monthly rd meetings here . i have only been for breakfast/lunch and would like to go to the pizzeria at night . i love the ambiance of this place . it 's so cute and trendy
4 i moved here last december and so far this is my favorite pizza spot . i had the thin crust -lrb- whole wheat -rrb- chicken pesto pizza and it was amazing !! i love pesto . and there have been a couple occasions where my friends and i have gone
2 i had mixed feelings about this place . if i could i would give it a 3.5 . pros : fast and polite service . i like the idea of being able to order and try a bunch of different things . the variety of protein choices is great and
3 bungalow is one of my favorite places for happy hour . they have good specials and i love the happy hour food . that grilled cheese is gon na give me a heart attack <unk> day but its soooo good . i 've also come here for a nice lunch
3 i am liking this place more and more everytime i go here . i first went only for the sweets . their cupcakes are some of my favorites and its rare to find authentic <unk> . i finally went here for lunch and it was fantastic . i got the
2 i really do n't like bbq but the boyfriend does so every once in awhile i had to please him . so i have to rate this place mostly according to him . i had the catfish fingers . which were great , but kind of hard to mess up
3 i 've only been here once but this place is pretty legit for pizza . i like places with a lot of variety for pizza since i 'm a total weirdo and refuse to eat tomato sauce . i had chicken pesto . i am usually a thin crust person
1 i was super excited to try petite maison after the rave reviews here on yelp , and also because my husband and i will be going to paris later this year and felt some french food would get us into the spirit . unfortunately for us , this was pretty
3 i am so happy to have discovered this gem , thanks to my fellow yelpers ! the hubs , a friend , and i were looking for somewhere new to try this past friday night . i , of course , consulted my yelp `` must try '' list .
2 i like it , but i do n't love it ... that 's how i felt after leaving culinary dropout . out of all the fox restaurants i 've been to this one is n't the worst , but not the best . i hate true food but love the
2 so , i 've been wanting to try az 88 for awhile now , and this friday this was the spot chosen for double date night ... yay . with all the hype about this place i felt like we were in for a treat , but unfortunately , we
3 before a suns game recently , my family and i stopped into blue hound for some drinks and appetizers . we attempted to go to arrogant butcher -lrb- been there many times -rrb- , but it was packed . having heard good things from another family member , we decided
2 another date night with the hubs , but this time he thought to try somewhere new i 've been wanting to go - so he picked up a localdines coupon and we headed to <unk> house . first off , i did like the decor , but the tables were
3 what a yummy place ! i really ca n't say enough good things about this spot right across from us airways center . my mom and i went here before a concert recently . i was able to make a reservations , which was super nice because we got in
3 i am still thinking about this pizza 1 day later , that 's how good it is . now , i 've had pizza in italy and cibo is n't as good as that , however , it is some of the best i 've had since italy and was
4 loved , loved , loved this place ! hubs and i went here for date night yesterday and have nothing but great things to say about this restaurant . we shared everything and had the duck fajitas , catfish , green chili mac and cheese , and the `` mushroom
4 it is just as one would think of when you would want some good food made from scratch daily with some of that quintessential homemade flavor and love . when there are local food that <unk> the heart and culture of a city lolo 's would be a big part
3 i like that they have a huge variety of drinks . so many that i never can decide and end up in a <unk> and ordering the same thing every time . the red bean slush is so good and they put a scoop of the red bean on top
3 when comparing this place to the previous hodori of days past it has gone down hill considerably . i have seen it 's ups and downs but with changing of hands as if it were <unk> this place has been through a lot . the current owner who ever it
0 i have been here a couple times . the first time i went it was still under the shanghai palace name . i heard that shanghai palace was the only place in town that had soup dumplings . when i went i turned out the place changed hands to tottie
1 with a name like cask 63 we expected a <unk> experience . major disappointment . the interior is little changed from the previous restaurant - certainly nothing that <unk> to the <unk> name . the wine was just so-so ; we had to return on dish as it was over
3 japanese food - so yummy definitely a stop when you have a japanese food craving . excellent quality ; very good prices . the wait staff is also very good . hard to beat that combination .
2 oregano 's has a major following - basically they give one a lot of good food for a moderate price . small wonder that families flock to the place . we had a pizza - next time i 'll stay with a salad .
3 this place is a good escape in the scottsdale scene . it feels like rocky point spring break but super upgraded ! there is no better place to sip a corona then at dos gringos without a passport , at least .
4 i love this place ! the pizza is so good and it never disappoints . i went to school down in tucson and they just opened one near arizona stadium , i screamed when i saw the sign for the one in tucson i was so excited . now i
4 love love love the biltmore ! by far my favorite macy 's ever ! because they have more upscale merchandise but the same sales as every other macy 's . i have found some amazing shoe deals here ! i also enjoy the set up and browsing through the stuff
3 cute , quaint , simple , honest . i really like this place . the pad thai is n't the best i 've had , but it 's still very good . the portion is large , and the price is reasonable . the green curry is really good .
4 pane bianco is a refreshing breath of air . after having a bad experience at pizzeria bianco , i was pretty hesitant to try pane . my husband talked me into going , and i 'm really glad that he did . restaurant is located next to lux , so
2 nice , new stadium . lots of parking options -lrb- cheaper spaces that are further from the stadium and vice <unk> -rrb- and lots of places to buy food . the seats are a little small and uncomfortable , but i would n't mind going back and watching another game
4 ohhh wow . delicious . my husband and i love gallo blanco , so we had to try otro cafe . the location is interesting ; the restaurant is open and spacey , which i think i prefer to gallo , and the seating is more comfortable . i really
2 delicious food . we stared with the chips and salsa , which was spicy and tasty . the blue corn enchiladas were excellent . the rice was super light and fluffy , and the zucchini were grilled were . the chimichanga was also really good , with a perfectly fried
3 this is a very interesting , very informative museum . the architecture of the building is beautiful and simply adds to the extensive , well displayed exhibits . i was a little disappointed that a good amount of the art on display is modern -lrb- made in the last 4
3 good selection , well stocked , and fairly reasonable prices . i like the food and wine sections best - lots of my favorite british desserts , candies , and chocolates at decent prices . also a good place to go if you need to find a gift for someone
2 this place is alright . it 's large , and has a ton of large tvs which i think would be good for watching a football game . the beer selection is large , the food is average , and the service is good . i 'd go back ,
2 ~ update ~ i have to assume that our service experience was n't the norm because the manager saw this review and 1 . got back to me promptly -lrb- within hours -rrb- and 2 . did everything he could to make the situation right . i think i 'll
4 there is n't a better place to take a date in phoenix . the owners are always present and welcome guests as old friends . the patio is absolutely gorgeous and has live music on the weekends . the inside is a bit cramped , but is bursting with ambiance
4 i want to <unk> this place every time i try something new here ! i think the chai tsoynami changed my life last week . but maybe i 'm only saying that because i am lost in a post chocolate <unk> cupcake high . so rich . so moist .
3 i have been here many times over the years , even celebrating my 2 year anniversary with my sweetie here . i like that they have an amazing selection of cheese , my total weakness . recently we went to one of their specialty dinners and the experience was top
4 i felt it was necessary to write about yogurtland once again . i went on a wednesday afternoon at 3 and was so surprised to see the line was at least 20 people deep . i thought it was going to be a long wait in line but the exact
4 i ca n't say enough great things about the tuck shop ! i have been there a handful of times and every time they are gracious and inviting . a few of those occasions i have been with a group of people and we always get loud and rowdy .
4 i had to review this place again because i have decided it is my favorite neighborhood spot hands down ! i went last night on a whim with my fiance after we both had a very long day and were starving . the pasta fries were amazing and the dipping
3 really nice fancy mall . reminds of the the <unk> malls in texas . i like how most of their kids clothing stores are in one hall of the mall . makes getting stuff for the kiddo a breeze .
2 i 've been to 3 mills malls and this is probably the least impressive . i do n't like the way it is set up with the food court in the `` back '' and do they really have to have <unk> <unk> rides every few feet ?!?!?! i 'm
2 the spring rolls were good and the food we ordered was a-ok . that about sums it up . not the great vietnamese food i ever had but it 's hard to go wrong with fish sauce ! service was decent , too . we had the noodle salad and
2 the food was good . i enjoyed their sides and cornbread and thought the ribs were decent but not the best i ever had . the staff was great and we even got a complimentary bottle of their famous sauce for being a <unk> guest . that was definitely very
3 we come here pretty frequently . i 've never had mongolian stir fry in other restaurants b ' c the only other place i 've seen them at is at buffets and there 's just other things to eat there ! i have , however , been to several other
3 expensive foo-foo cupcakes but worth every penny and calorie !! service is great here ... took some on the plane and when i explained this to the ladies , the wrapped each cupcake individually before placing <unk> in the box . then they sealed the box up for me so
3 never been to a total wine before . it was fun to see that they had more than just wine , although my mission for the night was for wine it is good to know that i could still get a bottle of beer or liqueur . it also impressed
3 it was quite refreshing to walk into the herb box and not have to wait to be seated for an hour in old town scottdale on a sunday . the ambiance is one <unk> feels fancy but yet its like the comfort of your home . the service received was
4 for a sports bar this one is one of the most underrated but most awesome places in scottsdale . big game days can make it get packed so arrive early if you want a seat . there are plenty of tvs through the bar so being able to see a
3 i went to this place to chill out with some friends and found a awesome to get a beer with friends . i noticed that this place served food but i did n't try any while i was there . it was nice to find a local place that offer
2 went to this place after the event on monday night and was not impressed . when we first walked in the staff looked at our group like it we were a fish out of water and was put out to seat us . our server was only pleasant enough but
3 i love that this place . is an old warehouse converted to be a night club . early in the evening the place was n't as packed . there is a nice little dance floor for some fun and pool tables in the back . also available is a small
3 a great place to grab a bite if you 're out of time and happen to be downtown . notable dishes which i recommend are the spicy korean and tai mango chicken . i mean if you really wanted to try something spicy , healthy and delicious , you would
3 funk yeah ! this place is the sheet for chilling downtown without the frown . where else are you going to swamp yourself in artisan suds as well as the classic <unk> ? <unk> question -- no where . just the tips : - roast beef sandwich is mostly awesome
4 you ca n't go wrong when you can get comfort food and southern hospitality until midnight . chicken , waffles , grits , greens , corn bread ? yes , please ; all of the above plus some purple drink , too ! i 'd avoid the early weekend mornings
3 first and foremost , i ca n't believe it 's taken me this long to come here . a friend and i came in for lunch yesterday ... if that 's what you want to call it . i 'll call it grown up sunday funday . i say grown
2 man . i 'm torn about this place . let 's talk good stuff first : it 's convenient , it 's close to everything . i love their <unk> in every flavor , they often have great deals on food and drinks . it 's a great place for
3 i really like the vibe of this place . been here a few times and it 's always a good time . they have some awesome beers and you can create your own sampler since they 're only $ 1 or $ 2 . the food is decent . i
3 this place is a hidden gem and when driving through here for years i have to say the exterior makes me a bit weary on whether this place is capable of producing great food . we decided to stop by for lunch with a few compadres from the office .
2 we went here for their easter brunch and enjoyed our meal , the view at this place is awesome and the staff are up to par for a hyatt . wish i can say it 's anything more , but the service and cost for the complimentary champagne is a-okay
3 good food here the cocktails are great , definitely a bit too pricey for my experience eating at these type of places . i would recommend it more if they were a bit more realistic with the price for the portion . or maybe i just do n't like the
3 this place deserves a great review for it 's concept and uniqueness . do n't come here if you are expecting the norm . this multi purpose building -lrb- boxing gym , bar , clothing shop , bike shop , bar , pie shop , restaurant -rrb- can be a
3 best lunch spots at the biltmore if you are looking for a fairly well priced sushi selection . i am a big fan of their bento 's , they pack them with two salads , lettuce and cucumber and finish them off with your favorite fish , chicken or meats
3 delux has been a great spot for years and many burger joints have tried to copy this concept and they are good but there is one delux . the french fry 's on a cart of pretty bananas and the sweet potato style cart is just as great if not
3 stopped for a beer and food to go ... smaller bar area but cozy and cheers like : -rrb-
4 evil roll ... not so much ! the <unk> in the next booth ate 2 while i watched lol <unk> was a great server ! very helpful and friendly ; -rrb- seriously though , amazing ! love this place !
4 amazing food in a fantastic , comfortable atmosphere . usually just order the shrimp and oysters but tonight we went out on a limb and ordered the clams and oysters rockefeller in addition to the shrimp . i know , life is all about taking chances . anyway , they
2 a solid place to get a freshly prepared burger . i like their onion rings also .
2 not a bad place to eat . a little pricey for what you get . nice location with a patio . good place for happy hour .
2 a much better option than subway for a quick sandwich . many options for customization .
2 good destination for pizza . would frequently go there for a slice at lunch when i worked in the area . nice new york style pizza with a crisp crust .
2 good food for a pretty good price . it 's not spectacular by any means but prices are good given the size and quality of the burgers and sandwiches . the sweet potato fries are good , onion rings are a little above average and the service is great .
4 awesome sandwiches . i 've been here a few times now and every time , the sandwiches are fresh and filling . this is probably my favorite sandwich shop in town . the service is great and all of the staff are always friendly .
1 i have friends who love this place , but it 's really just bland and overpriced . $ 13 for a small burrito , taco , and drink is way too much for what it is . i would n't go out of my way to come here , but
2 i cant say i was amazed ! the salsa was <unk> likely and the food was about standard , nothing that i would write a <unk> review about . . we ordered the app sampler <unk> , everything was covered in beans and lettuce , it didnt seem as if
4 what a great find . . i 've been searching for years for a place like this . . sketchy from the outside but worth the wait and that you will do . ordered chicken tikka marsala . -lrb- 6 on spice scale , could have gone to an 8
1 the lobster bisque is amazing i do agree , however anything above and beyond the bar takes acts of <unk> to get right . . the server took it upon himself to assume i wanted a side portion instead of a dinner portion of a salad at dinner time -lrb-
3 let 's just say that i spend far too much time here . the service is always good , as is the food . eating the chili lemongrass chicken for the first time ... it <unk> me ... greatly .
4 do yourself a favor , save some $ $ and make a weekly ... daily trip to this place until you experience the entire menu . seriously , its that f ` in awesome
3 come for hh , it 'll allow you to eat more and save money at the same time
4 three words ` warm butter cake ! ' once you finish your perfectly <unk> steak accompanied by any number of delicious sides -lrb- i recommend the lobster gnocchi , <unk> with a pound of succulent lobster & black truffles -rrb- , or their amazing creamed corn , you simply must
3 i recently dropped by one of my favorite local , family owned and operated restaurants to warm my belly with delicious hot food . why do i emphasize the word hot here ? well , this particular restaurant happens to be hana japanese eatery , my favorite place for sushi
4 people often comment that various social media outlets are a waste of time , brain power and lead to a loss of workplace <unk> . for me , sites like twitter and facebook are a way to connect with like minded people and stay up to date on news and
2 want to know what it 's like to be involved in human <unk> ? come here right before it <unk> to the bar life . we came at 9 p.m. and were lucky to get in without a line and find a table right away ... but within the hour
3 sacks is a great place to go if you 're craving sandwiches and you happen to be <unk> asu 's tempe campus . it 's a cute little sandwich shop and all of the sandwiches have artist names . the sandwiches are delicious - the bread always seems fresh and
4 let me preface this : every other grocery store in a 10 mile radius could spontaneously <unk> one day and i would n't notice . i only have eyes for fresh and easy . this grocery store is small , but packs a big punch . they have an excellent
4 z ` tejas is awesome ! they had me at the free cornbread , which is delicious and moist ... and free . there are many vegetarian options , most of which are a lot more interesting than the standard veg tex mex fare , which is a large part
2 i think the drybar concept is fantastic , the price is right , the pampering is excellent , and so many of the girls i saw come in and get their hair done left looking fantastic ! my experience was not entirely positive . the <unk> at the front who
3 humble pie has a fantastic lunch special where you can get any salad and any pizza for under $ 10 . the salads are great and there are a ton of different pizza options , including some fancy vegetarian ones . i had the apple arugula salad , which was
3 like its name , jalapeno inferno bistro mexicana has a <unk> large food menu & drink menu , and it was all really good . i would definitely return here , whether for happy hour -lrb- okay definitely for happy hour -rrb- or dinner -lrb- also a definite yes -rrb-
2 cooperstown is a great place to hang out before a diamondbacks game . it 's quite large , has a ton of tv 's & cold beer , and has a very lively atmosphere . we ended up here because <unk> -lrb- coach & willies -rrb- was way too quiet
4 what a fantastic restaurant , especially during restaurant week ! the food overall was really good and at a very good value on restaurant week prices . the outdoor patio is cute and there was a live jazz band when we visited on a saturday evening . i had :
3 i had an assortment of pies from honey moon sweets at a work event , and boy are they good ! the peanut butter pie is mind blowing ! if you like -lrb- okay love , who just `` likes '' reeses ? -rrb- reeses peanut butter cups , this
3 j and i are fans of the fish tacos here . and we usually only go on tuesday when they 're $ 1.50 a piece . dinner for the 2 of us for under $ 9.00 , not too shabby !!! j is a fan of the hot carrots they
1 j and i went for sunday morning brunch at wandering horse the other sunday . with all the 5 star reviews , we figured this place would be a hit . in the end , we were disappointed . j definitely was when he was given the total price at

0 this walmart is in my `` hood '' and i will seriously only shop here if i 'm desperate and can not wait until frys or target opens . dirty store - check wait 30 minutes in line to check out - check need to `` hire '' someone to
3 now , i 'll tell you i was a little skeptical . a place that serves mexican food and diner food . come on , now . but , i had a 2 4 1 entree coupon via my new entertainment book , so a colleague and i decided to
3 fast service ... decent food . reasonable prices .
3 we 've gone to mac now twice . first time for the alton brown show in october , and then just this past friday for the <unk> tour . when we went to the ab show , j had originally purchased tickets up in the balcony . we quickly discovered
2 now , we might have gotten some strange looks from other patrons cause we brought baby c here cause well ... this place is a pub after all . but they do serve food and we were n't ordering baby c car bombs or anything and he was behaved -
2 i have spent many an hour at this airport and it is a decent airport . spent most of my time in terminal 4 , so that 's the only one i feel comfortable reviewing . easy to get around , moving sidewalks , mostly enough seating , except at
4 i do n't give out 5 star reviews very often , but this place deserves one , and then some . we went early evening this last sunday . we walked in , and were immediately greeted and sat . the place is really cute , very very comfortable chairs
1 we met some friends there , there were 4 of us all together . i ordered a navajo chicken sandwich . my daughter ordered a bacon cheeseburger , and my friends ordered an asian chicken salad and a chicken salad sandwich . 20 minutes later , my friends got their
4 one of the best gelato places in the valley that i have tried . only one i 've been to better is in tucson , and that place is like being in italy , this place is a hairs <unk> from that . wonderful service , great atmosphere , parking
1 the greek fries are good . ripe salad was ok . veg wrap was a oversized tortilla with <unk> sauce and a 1/4 cup of veggies . gyro pita was dry so tried to cover up with <unk> sauce but it was n't that good and kind of thick .
4 everything i tried so far has been great !
3 my wife and u enjoyed our dinner here . we had great service and enjoyed the food . i look forward to going back .
3 upon arrival , i was pleasantly surprised to find that they expanded the restaurant . we were seated in the new room in the back ; it was like being in a restored tuscan farmhouse with all the candles , paintings , chandeliers , <unk> , books and such .
4 this is as good as it gets for ambiance and great food and being walking distance from where i live in central phoenix . the host is always friendly and his suggestions of the most popular dishes were right on the money this time : beef milanesa , beet cannelloni
2 <unk> expectation of a diner . the reuben sandwich was pretty good . onions rings were a little lukewarm but the fries were very fresh , hot and delicious . for a small kitchen , they really <unk> out the food fast and the service was not bad .
4 i love this place that i just keep coming back on a regular basis . my food recommendations : orange puff , spicy wontons , soup gyoza , potstickers and the saigon basil for the larger entree . i have always received great service from lynn ; she is friendly
3 * please note , i 'm writing in review of the happy hour only . i recently discovered this happy hour gem with some girl friends , and it has quickly become a favorite in the portfolio -lrb- instead of ladies who lunch , i guess we 're ladies who
3 sushi brokers is a staple in my portfolio . they have a great happy hour with discounts on select sushi and beverages , and it can accommodate many different sizes of groups . this <unk> place is great for unwinding with co-workers , meeting up with friends or even getting

3 *** this review based on happy hour only . i 'm excited about this place . while i was slightly disappointed in the complete lack of happy hour drink or food specials -lrb- how can you refuse to acknowledge happy hour ?? -rrb- , by the time i left ,
2 the worst service ever , ever ! the food is delicious though , service is literally a joke .
3 glorious , utter glory .
3 bomb burgers and fairly cheap
2 ventured here this sunday morning not realizing it was the opening weekend ; was told they had just opened on tuesday . that being said , they definitely have a few kinks to work out . they prevented customers from using the door on cactus as an entrance -lrb- understandable
0 i have been back to this honey bear 's location several times since my first review . and the place has gotten significantly worse on each subsequent visit . this last visit will definitely be my last . the place does not look well maintained at all and the food
2 bbq here is okay but nothing to write home about in my book . i 've definitely had better and also had worse at other places . my most recent meal was the jumbo sandwich with chopped brisket and hot links -lrb- added photo -rrb- . the brisket was okay
4 it there anything bad you can say about oregano 's ???? i have been enjoying their food since 2001 ... and i have never eaten anything there that i have not loved . all of their pizzas , salads , pastas are delicious !!!! their bellini is yummy ! and
4 yummy !!! i have only had delicious and fresh food from defalco 's ... and i have been a customer for the last 5 years !! great food , friendly staff . just a heads up ... because the food is so good ... they can tend to have a

4 i have been going to this restaurant for years , even before it was texaz when it used to be known as <unk> . they have been in the valley for years and i can understand why . their food is simple and delicious . their chicken fried steak is
3 i was very impressed with this pizza delivery place . after reading the so-so comments on their yelp page , i decided i wanted something different from streets of new york and hungry howie 's and decided to give little chicago pizza a try . i am so very glad
2 i love this place for delivery chinese . as everyone else has said , it is decent food , not the best or very authentic , but for delivery chinese it takes the cake . i love the house special chicken and their rice that comes with the entree is
2 well , i have n't had anything to eat all day and i thought i would stop in for a burger . my sister in law loves this place but i 'm not sure what all of the hype is about ! the fries arent bad but i think i
1 i had my reservations about going to an upscale mexican restaurant because we all know the best mexican food can be found in da hood at a real dive ! however , against my better judgment , i decided to give this place a try ! note to self :
3 ya got ta live a place that has happy hour on sundays !!! 3 mini tacos for $ 7 !!! cheers !!!
4 this place is so awesome ! you feel like you 're in a little , off beat restaurant in chicago or new york , instead of phoenix ! the service is very friendly . it 's a small place but the food is excellent and big ! if you 've
3 this place is pretty cool ! the atmosphere is wonderful ! i love the chandeliers and the chairs are huge and comfy ! we came in to have drinks and watch the ncaa <unk> , and we ended up ordering food ! whoever thought of grilled cheese sliders with bacon
4 the service at the bar is phenomenal ! john gave me the menu and told me to make a few choices first , before offering his advice ! he , then , made me this awesome margarita and suggested the machaca chicken taquitos after listening to my taste preference !
4 what a gorgeous addition to the downtown area . it will be nice when the economy picks up and they are able to finish the whole project . the temporary trailer is a bit of distraction to the incredible garden that awaits .
4 best crab cake in town ? close second to ruth 's chris steakhouse -- this is a fantastic little restaurant in downtown phoenix . love the family-owned feel .
4 service is excellent . best steak in town . it is an expensive splurge , but worth it .
0 food was okay . <unk> manager did n't greet us at door . all the employees seemed absolutely miserable <unk> the manager . what a depressing mood in this place .
3 we enjoyed our meal here .
1 average at best . eye is off the ball . average food . weak service . too many other better choices . i knew i should have questioned this place as i came from the covered parking section and noticed trash and boxes were left out by the wood pile
4 expert service . exceptional food every time . beautiful ambiance !
1 thanksgiving dinner at $ 75 per head was very disappointing last evening . the food was just average at best . the food was bland and uninspired . we will not return here .
3 i love an irish pub , and i love me some fibber magee 's . my trips are fewer now that i live out in east hell -lrb- queen creek -rrb- , but when i lived in chandler @ dobson & warner , i visited much more often . i
4 woah , <unk> ! is there anything better than oregano 's ? the parking situation could be improved and the place gets crowded fast -lrb- a sign of a good establishment -rrb- , so try to get there right at 11:00 when they open if you are planning a lunch
2 i visited this <unk> for a recent <unk> . the location was good and i was impressed with the size of the gaming floor . there were several slot machines and gaming tables ranging in price . as i walked around i noticed a couple of <unk> options and a
2 i had a lunch date here today , and initially was not happy with her choice of restaurants . the first time i had pita jungle , i was not impressed and wondered why everyone raved about it . i ordered the sample platter and it was filled with things

0 do n't be fooled by happy hour prices . i went yesterday and the waitress talked about 1/2 price appetizers , drinks , well drinks , etc. . that price is only good at the bar . if you are at a table you will not get it . i
3 recently i saw that my big boss , dr. love checked in to caffe boa for a brunch . in speaking to him , the menu sounded wonderful and i thought it might be a good <unk> dinner experience ; saturday was my opportunity . i was greeted promptly and
3 irish pubs are one of my favorite things . i met a friend for drinks at a nearby bar a couple of weeks ago . he said he wanted to check the skeptical chymist on the way out because a couple of night prior he went to rubio 's and
3 i had a fantastic time here this evening . i came during happy hour and tried the california roll and garden <unk> . i thought since it was tempura shrimp and seared tuna it would count as me being adventurous with sushi . i texted andrea k. and she confirmed
4 the zoo is cool ! i have enjoyed the zoo lights in the fall in the past and this weekend visited for the giraffe encounter . i highly recommend seeking this exhibit . it is $ 3 in addition to the fee to get into the zoo , but it
1 for review 200 i wanted to take something from my bookmark list . i was downtown for the herberger theater and passed by the old spaghetti factory . i used to visit the osf in atlanta and when i lived in ohio . i remember always enjoying the experience ...
2 went here for breakfast , but ending up getting lunch . my dad and husband both ordered the irish breakfast and i ordered the corned beef and cabbage boxty . the boxty was good . way too much cabbage , but still decent . i enjoyed the atmosphere of the
1 i went to the compound strictly to see a band play . i did not try any of the food , so i can only comment on this place as a music venue . the compound really needs to rethink the set up of this place . it 's more
3 pugzie 's is a place i 've driven by many times , but never had the opportunity to eat there because my schedule did n't align with theirs . well now that i 'm unemployed i have lots of spare time and i 've been to pugzie 's at least
3 my husband and i ate breakfast here last sunday and were not disappointed . the place was n't too busy so it was easy to walk in and grab a table . i ordered the hash mash which is corned beef , scrambled eggs , potatoes and cheese in a
3 mmmm , ted 's is sooo good ! i love their onion rings . great hot dogs too . my complaints about ted 's , they only accept cash . i never carry cash , so i rarely eat at ted 's and anytime i go there is a huge
3 i love me some mrs. white 's . it 's been a few years since i 've eaten here and boy have i missed this place and their delicous food . on my recent visit i ordered the catfish with green beans and okra gumbo -lrb- a friday only special
4 my husband and i just got back from italy and had some fantastic food . i feel that we are both extremely good creative cooks and are kind of food snobs with a discerning palate ! we absolutely loved this place ! the ambiance ! the hospitality ! the waitstaff
4 this is truly the best of its kind in the valley ... the mixed grill is awesome . the quality of the meat is excellent . this is one of those that we go back to again and again ... better than all the others you are reading about really
4 i have been wanting to go to the one and only `` cambodian '' restaurant in the valley for quite a few months and we finally made it and loved it from the moment we entered . an aura of love , peace and harmony welcomed us in . loved
4 love this place . truly one of the best italian restaurants in the valley . . great ambiance . authentic italian food . very reasonable priced as well . great service
4 lots of fun . great chicago food ...
2 these were n't the `` pasties '' i was thinking of ... joking , obviously . i was here to celebrate a friend 's birthday . they told us 20 people would fit at one of the long tables . uh , no . not unless we all sat <unk>
4 it 's like disneyland for <unk> ! although i 'm not much of a wine drinker , their selection is outstanding . but that goes for the beer and other liquors , too . the prices are great and are usually lower than most other places . they offer wine
2 husband and i tried joey 's on a friday evening . we both had the italian beef , wet , with mozzarella cheese , mine with sweet peppers . it was good ... decent ... nothing spectacular . the beef was seasoned well and very tender . we ordered them
4 what an amazing new addition to one of phoenix 's already amazing offerings -lrb- dbg -rrb- . i was lucky enough to partake in the `` soft '' opening this week at gertrude 's -lrb- opening officially tomorrow -rrb- . first glance the decore is very nice , minimalist ,
4 i pretty much have no clue why anyone could give lux anything but a 4 or a 5 star review . i guess we could just chalk them up to someone who must have been having an all around bad day that day , i forgive them . lux is
2 other than the football stadium saddle ranch is about the only good thing i can find in this area . the other bars are a bit ghetto for me , but a saddle ranch is a saddle ranch . i usually end up at the scottsdale location at some point
4 i must write a <unk> ... apparent `` someone '' had a problem with the vig using the words sunday and funday together so it is now called `` sunday school '' not nearly as cool sounding , but a great day to be at the vig none the less
2 i have been anxiously awaiting my trip to trader vic 's ! i have driven past the place many times on my way to scottsdale and always mention how i want to go . i finally did it ... for a girl friends birthday . it was fairly dead ,
4 i have to tell you about the brunch i had at el chorro over the weekend ... so good ! it literally could n't have been any better . it was a gorgeous day out to start with and we got to sit out on the beautiful patio . we

3 my friends and i have started frequenting this place to get away from the scottsdale d **** bags if ya know what i mean . we had a lot of fun ! it gets a little packed on the roof , but it a great change of pace to be
3 first things first , yum ! some of the best tacos i have ever had . so much flavor i could n't believe it . we stopping in for dinner on a tuesday night , very slow , only two other table in the place at the time . no
3 moto is pretty high up there in the sushi world for me . i love my sushi so it take a good place to impress me . i first went to moto for their all-you-can-eat saturdays . in the beginning it was n't nearly as strict as it is now
3 wow ! this place has changed ! i used to work at the scottsdale air park and would pop into h & m a few times a week at lunch . then there were only a few stores goin on . but now ! there are all kinds of placed
4 first and <unk> ... thank you <unk> 's dad ! probably <unk> guy ever ! he took us all out to the most amazing dinner ever here ! everything we had was amazing ! we first started off with the seafood tower that was insane ! oysters , crab ,
3 i have to admit that thai food is probably some of the best to come out of asia . healthy for the most part , great flavor and color , and not deep fried for the most part . i have lived down the street from thai lahna for nearly
3 ajs fine food is a place where i only go if i have a specific need . my need is usually a gigantic iced tea on my way to work when it 's <unk> degrees outside in this arizona summer . they usually have several different flavors to wet your

3 what can i say ? i 've been coming here for years for a reason ... the food is fabulous . lunch time buffet for $ 10 all you can eat . the best tandoori and mango <unk> you will ever have . the atmosphere is perfect . indian tv
4 the ambiance is divine . an indoor/outdoor layout that works very well . the menu is what counts , and tmi has an awesome one . i highly recommend making a special trip here for lunch . i am always impressed .
1 the <unk> and execution of this stores existence is superior . i love having this store in my neighborhood . however , the management and <unk> of staff is horrible . i 've been now over a dozen times and not once have i received anything but incompetent service .
4 hatch chilies ... just the thought of them , make my mouth water . no one , and i mean no one does hatch chilies like arriba mexican grill . every sunday the haul out the fire roaster and roast chilies all day long . you can buy them $
0 i found the sushi here to be mostly mediocre . the garden roll is pretty good , but takes a long time to make . why i am writing here is this : i ordered an avocado roll . pretty simple and standard , it 's just sushi rice ,
4 the best massaman -lrb- sp ? -rrb- curry i 've ever had , and i 've had a lot . and great pad thai as well . however , as a spice wimp , i asked for my dish as mild as possible , yet tons of red flakes peeked
4 a friend and i had a delightful experience here . we ordered an avocado roll and pad thai . the avocado roll was simply to die for . it was soft and creamy - and i 'm including the rice in this , too . it was an avocado roll
1 we make a point of going to cupcake places when we are on vacation . we always get one red velvet and one of their `` unique '' cupcakes . we use the red velvet as a control and the other to gauge creativity . we finally decided to try
3 how i want to give this place 5 stars . i <unk> with it for at least 5 minutes before finally writing this . the location is killer . not only is it in ` slope -lrb- which is an awesome neighborhood -rrb- but it is an old fire house
1 wow i was so disappointed with this place . lots of hype and tons of memories of real candy shops got me all excited that smeeks was one of the first places we hit when we got back into phoenix . ca n't say i 've been more disappointed by
2 finally made it out to the <unk> this past weekend . the last time i had been out here was to check out the sheraton for a wedding site . a lot has changed since then . the new <unk> is right off the freeway . there are exit lanes
3 went for happy hour on a tuesday evening . showed up around 4 and the place was dead . by <unk> , the business crowed from downtown had made it and the place was hoppin ' . definitely a business crowd place but still laid back . the prices of
1 my food experience was just so strange and terrible at the same time . the breadsticks reminded me of fazoli 's . anyone remember that place ? remember the breadsticks ? ya , they were stale , dry , and overly <unk> of the <unk> inside my mouth . they
2 the food is decent in a `` i 'm tired of driving around , just pick a place '' kind of way . soups , sandwiches , etc. . the kind of stuff you find at mary coyle 's but without all of the good desserts . the <unk> is
3 so we went here for game night uye and i was a little concerned that it was going to be a -rrb- too loud or b -rrb- too crowded . we found a giant wooden <unk> thing and set up shop there . the waiters/waitresses were all cool and very
4 matt & <unk> 's new place is wicked cool . situated in the bottom of an architect 's office and across the street from survivor 's park , this is sure to be a great place . we got to go check it out during a sneak preview last weekend
4 if this place were only closer to downtown , i would be there every weekend . the biscuits and gravy are amazing and simply the best . the chef is awesome and the service is wonderful . they do a great job turning over tables and the size of the
3 this place has been a long time coming . it is damn near impossible for me to make it out to avondale , ever , but we finally did last weekend and the first thing that <unk> to mind was going here . so very glad we did . i
1 so <unk> -lrb- as i like to call it -rrb- has been staring at me every time i go to f & e and i finally convinced my wife to try thai food . we went over here on a saturday night and i was totally excited for a new

3 the thing i love about being italian is finding good authentic italian delis that will provide me with life 's little pleasures . i love <unk> . i love mozzarella . i love cannoli . the thing about italian food is that , for the most part , it 's
2 zipps is weak . it 's really nice inside ... but very loud -lrb- it is a sports bar -rrb- . my parents wanted some peace and quiet so we relocated out on to the patio . do n't sit out here if you have an aversion to cigarette smoke
3 i love yogurtology because every location has a slightly different twist on the high-quality flavors and toppings . the staff at this location were incredibly knowledgeable and enthusiastic . the guy who was <unk> samples gave some interesting details about how their yogurts are made . the oatmeal cookie is
2 delicious ! the restaurant appears clean and stylish -lrb- i was told to go to a dirty , hole-in-the-wall place to find authentic pho ... um , no thank you -rrb- and the waitstaff was very pleasant , although they seemed to be <unk> . the hot jasmine tea was
2 the food at pita jungle never disappoints . everything is made with high-quality , fresh ingredients . four and a half stars for food . i have a problem with the inconsistency in service . one and a half star for service . i 've called ahead and placed to-go
2 on atmosphere alone i 'd give sapporo five stars . the restaurant offers a trendy , modern decor and its spacious enough to accommodate the vibe you 're seeking , whether it 's an intimate date , the bar scene , the sushi bar , a group hibachi table or
3 i was a little skeptical about this place , especially after my wide range of pho experiences , but saigon nites does pho , and they do it well . the first few minutes were a little awkward ... was i expected to wait for the waitress or seat myself
3 i really enjoy defalco 's because of its unique atmosphere and the exceptional , authentic italian food . defalco 's is a family-owned italian deli and market . the restaurant is divided by racks of wine , imported pasta and a large inventory of desserts and treats . after ordering
2 i 'm not overly impressed with ajo al 's . i was dining with a large group , so maybe that explains the waitress 's snappy <unk> . i did n't feel very welcome in this restaurant . luckily i had some wonderful company make up for this ! chips
3 digital screen ! i remember seeing iron man here at midnight this past summer . great experience , will definitely be coming back .
1 one of our <unk> insists on taking us here for lunch about once a quarter . it kinda sucks . not offensive , but awfully boring . things on the broad menu look like they should be better than they are . blah . plus we ca n't booze at
3 absolutely the wrong time to be updating this , but whatever . busy week . anyway , the booze is cheaper than i remembered , unless they lowered their prices , the grilled cheese sammy is as good as advertised , and best of all , the midweek bar staff
3 my first introduction to <unk> food , and i can remember it like it was yesterday . it 's interesting and unusual , but nothing about it could be offensive . it 's just not * that * weird , despite how it looks and the way you eat it
4 i have and will continue to dream about the maple bacon creme brulee . sure it sounds weird . it was a little weird , actually . the most important point , however , was that it was delicious . in case you did n't know , you can track
4 what 's not to love about this place ? you have to love the food - i 've had an excellent quesadilla -lrb- shrimp and pesto -rrb- and a great burger -lrb- carolina burger , with bbq sauce that 's out of this world -rrb- , and loved every bite
3 ah , salt river . fun stuff . do n't bring anything valuable - there 's a good chance you 'll lose it . be cool , do n't freak out about the nasty water , seaweed , annoying drunks , or anything like that , and you 'll have
3 i really liked this place . the waiter was really helpful with the beer <unk> , even though they were out of my first two choices -lrb- i 'm not knocking them for that - i ca n't imagine the nightmare involved in keeping that much draft beer available all
3 this theater is on the nicer end of the spectrum , and it 's in a pretty quiet strip mall , so parking is usually not a problem . lots of screens gives you lots of options and times . one of the things i do n't like about this
4 i am in love with hanny 's . they now have a new upscale classic drink menu that is on the pricey side , but looks amazing . so far , i 've tried the english garden , which <unk> any other mixed drink i 've had as the best
4 great place for a date , great food and atmosphere . a little pricey but the food is worth it .
2 good place with a decent happy hour . loud
3 great place to let the dogs blow off some steam . huge park with separate places for active and passive dogs . will definitely be taking them back here now that the weather has gotten a little better .
2 pretty good . not spectacular enough to come back . maybe for hh . the service was meh ! waiter did not know the food nor the wine list . he was not upscale waiter material by any means , more like <unk> <unk> trying to serve . `` whoa

0 just as expensive and crappy as their main location . but it was the only place in the vicinity for booze . then got hungry and had a salad that was 12 freakin dollars for hardly anything . what a joke . lame !!! stay away people !
3 awesome place . i love bookstores and while your typical corporate books are great , you walk out spending a ton ! you can find so many new titles and even a decent selection of dvds and music all at decent prices here . my husband and i recently <unk>
2 buying : this is a total hit or miss . sometimes i go in and i find a handful of stuff that 's at just the right price . other times i go in and the only good things are the `` new '' things they have hanging with the

2 i love the food at andreoli but sometimes it seems that if you do n't speak italian that you 're actually somewhat of a <unk> to the folks there . i ducked in today at about 1:30 and it was pretty quiet . there were about 8 or 9 people
3 really , really enjoyed petite maison last night . first of all , i love the space . it 's small , which i think adds charm . the patio is great and with weather like we 've been having , it was amazing out there . i also love
1 i 'm a cheesesteak freak . i do admit that i am not from philly so my take is purely with regard to what tastes good to me . as far as this place , i 'd been wanting to go here for a long , long time as i

4 decaf espresso in the house !!! after multiple visits to sola and a variety of drinks , it 's safe to say that we 're huge fans . and the great thing is that they 're doing decaf espresso now too so the expecting moms now do n't need to
2 the gold brew was tasty and a bargain at $ 4 considering the large glass it is served in . the shrimp scampi appetizer was good . wings okay . the philly sandwich on the menu was a miss . . it was <unk> with very little meat . more

4 whole foods rocks ! i love going there to check out their fresh and wide variety of produce and admire their amazing desserts . my fave purchases at this store are the 3.99 2 pack of ciabatta bread made daily -lrb- great for making garlic bread -rrb- and their 2.99
2 now that i 'm a college grad -lrb- go sun devils ! -rrb- i 'm totally over ikea . now that we 've moved into our beautiful home i want better quality , better looking furniture to live with . different story in college though . my entire college dorm

2 my fiance says this place could use a million dollar renovation . he 's been going to this place for years and still looks exactly the same : abandoned , dusty , and dirty . we went recently to a free movie night and did n't mind coming in early
4 oh , the science center . i 've been coming to this museum in downtown phoenix since i was 16 years old . it 's a fun place for all ages and i remember various activities such as walking through a giant nose , lying on a bed of nails
4 who does n't like a <unk> piece of meat ? well no one does it better than fleming 's prime steakhouse & wine bar on <unk> street and ray . fleming 's is a great place to share generous portions of steak , hearty salads and decadent desserts . fleming
4 my arteries hate this place , but fortunately they do n't get to make decisions . so many things to love : 1 -rrb- you can sample their signature dishes 2 -rrb- combo options - 2 item + side or 1 item + side 3 -rrb- carnitas and jade red
3 everything an organization buff could hope for in a single place . need some inspiration to <unk> your house ? this is the place . i really appreciate the container store 's approach to organization : tuck away items neatly but still have them visible for easy access . we

4 this is by far the best middle eastern restaurant i 've eaten at . it 's inside a small plaza that 's nothing flashy , but step inside and it 's like walking into a vacation . the place is small , cozy and elegant . all the staff is
4 * note that the restaurant is not in the same building as their international store near price dr. but further west on apache blvd , just west of mcclintock drive . somewhere in the remote past , i swear that i was an <unk> . my taste buds tell me
4 well made drinks and tasty <unk> sorts of foods . i 've seen folks lament that this is n't a restaurant . i do n't think that 's what mabel 's is intended to be and it should n't be judged on that basis . you can certainly make a
2 good solid ma and pa restaurant . i had no idea this restaurant was here , and highly recommend you try if if you 've never gone . the atmosphere is quaint , cozy , and great for a <unk> .
0 gordon <unk> please visit this place ! * food little better than a tv dinner , yet <unk> with some of the best restaurants in town ... on price * they served us rancid wine . * service was terrible owner/manager hung out in lobby socializing with friends rather than

3 ca n't believe it 's taken me this long to write a review for la stalla cucina rustica . if you 're looking for delicious italian food that does n't resemble the corporate garbage that 's <unk> about the area , then look no further ! seriously , though ,

2 this place was <unk> to me . i was excited based on the reviews but was n't pleased with the food . i ordered a ceasar salad and the dressing was almost slimy . that is the only way i can describe it . my date ordered a philly cheese
3 i really enjoy this spot . i love the decor and overall vibe . the waiters have always been very nice and the food comes out fast . the garlic soy edamame is incredible and addicting . the bottle rocket rolls have this tangy cream cheese inside mixed with crab
3 this is a favorite for me and my friends . i love the concept of this place . the prices are great , the atmosphere is great , and the food is delicious . the tiramisu is wonderful . i just love this place . i always bring new people
2 i had the chorizo breakfast burrito was the saving grace that could cover some of the stink from past experiences . however their combo plates are pretty average as in filiberto 's in a dining hall setting average .
2 eh was definitely not as good as the other boba house , in tempe the boba was sorta not up to par and my melon slush was more like semi cold melon milk . also one drink that was about 16 oz was 5-6 dollars im down to give lollicup
1 glorified panda express with that <unk> aside i was willing to give ol pf changs another try when they served me a steamed shanghai shrimp dish that was devoid of flavor thinking less flavor meant a healthier meal i alas was given a shocking reminder of how this place sodium

4 awesome service , food & cleanliness ! this is one of our favorites !
3 service is fast and efficient , food is excellent . i wish they would stop walking away when you are trying to finish your order . stand still , smile and listen to your customers who have chosen to spend their hard earned money at your business !
3 met a client here for lunch yesterday . we were seated promptly and our server , katie , was great . my client had a burger and i ordered the scallops . our lunches were out within 15 minutes and we snacked on the warm bread and butter while we
4 my favorite pho restaurant ! rare beef pho is amazing and their broth has just a little something different from most of the pho places i have tried . way to go pho ao sen ! this place is a no brainer and a great place to take a date
4 attended a business lunch here today and as always , food , service and atmosphere were top-notch !
3 average location . not in the hood , but not a really great area either . there is a starbucks at this location and the store itself is clean and well organized inside .
3 yum ! try it ! adorable , small restaurant , so make a reservation . the service was top notch . full bar , including a fairly extensive wine list . i had the insalata <unk> e gorgonzola -lrb- mixed greens with pears , walnuts , gorgonzola , and blue

3 since there are no .5 star options , i 'm going to round up in this case ... but i think 3.5 would be a fair score . the food is good enough , but did n't blow me away . though , did you see them on `` diners
1 with a menu that starts with multiple pages of alcoholic beverages , i 'm going to guess this is more of a happy hour type of place . unfortunately for us , we came here for dinner . i thought the garlic edamame sounded good , but found it to

1 i 'd rather go to amado 's ! the only thing that 's good here is the bean dip , and i 'm only saying that so that i have something nice to say .
3 yes ! i love this trader joe 's ! they always have what i want and it 's easy to find . if they move something , i can ask someone who works there and they 're actually nice about showing me its new locale . love the tea tree
3 pretty cool cozy place on camelback . try the salmon , very tasty !
3 this is a real fun <unk> in phoenix . you have to put it on your list and stop in now and then . the staff and peeps there are really friendly and accommodating . the food is also very good -lrb- unbeatable salad bar -rrb- and some pretty good
2 i know most people are not going to agree with this review , but this is just an okay place in my book . first the positives , <unk> tucked away location , cozy , had some live music playing which was really nice . you do n't find that

2 great service , amazing decorations , food just ok . good for families . salad bread dinner and <unk> are a good value . just outside mall entrance .
3 brats , steaks , and everything you need for a bbq . try the jalapeno brats for a little heat . they have some combo specials that make a great gift idea .
1 lots of people ordering the two slice with salad and drink for $ 3.50 . i opted for a sandwich . i tried the philly . i am not a fan . meat was chewy and bread was n't anything exciting .
3 a bit pricey , yet one of the best breakfast sandwiches you will find . parking is slim .
3 nice small sandwich shop . nice owner , sandwiches and treats . it is so nice to have a local place .
3 this place is kind of a great find , good service , great food . the downside ... when we went there was no water in the outdoor `` river '' and there was a long wait on a friday night - so we sat in the bar . but
2 well , the food is great ... the service is only so , so . our waiter was nice but we had to wait about 10-15 mins for waters and my husband has too awkwardly `` wait '' by the door for a restroom to open . . which was
3 got ta say it - this store is dangerous if you have altogether stopped buying <unk> toys online and making trips to san fran . got ta give the boy props though for opening this place in phoenix . i 'm a supporter and hope we can <unk> light rail
2 for some reason or another this macy 's has a better selection of shoes than the one at scottsdale mall . in the past year i found a pair of <unk> <unk> sandals for half off , and they carry the higher end , younger brands - which is great
3 fez is great , but especially for a lighter meal at a site down place , for a good price . in and out in under an hour or so . good drinks and decent service .
2 we went here for dinner after friends recommended it . it was somewhat decent food and my friend got the `` boot '' of beer , which no matter how you drink it , is just funny . then we were informed that the place becomes `` a euro style

1 cute and sweet korean family running this place but really thought the donuts tasted like safeway or regular grocery store donuts -lrb- got the chocolate long john and <unk> -rrb- . but i do n't have an alternative go-to donut place so i guess this is my only option and

4 excellent options all around . super tasty stuff .
4 great cocktails . good beer excellent food . the venue is very casual and hip . fun place with fun people working there .
4 great service , excellent food , good beer , great coffee , and its falling distance from where i live . its hard not to just love the hell out of this place so i do n't . walked in for lunch and was greeted warmly and quickly . asked

4 local breeze is one of my favorite restaurants in the city . my bf and i go all the time for brunch , and they also have really good burgers too . my favorite part about this place is that they have a dog friendly patio . they usually bring
4 by far the best pho in town . i think we 've actually gone like 3 times in one week ! the place is so clean and the staff is so friendly . we 've tried several different things everytime we 've gone -lrb- along with our pho of course

2 bought a deal on yelp after driving by this place for the last three months . the staff were incredibly nice and attentive . the food was just okay . i really did not care for the pinto beans they use . they had an odd <unk> . the quesadilla
2 stopped by here for lunch after buying a groupon 12 for 20 . the restaurant inside was very modern looking and chill could be a fun place to hang out potentially . i ended up getting a grilled cheese with a side of sweet potato fries and red velvet cake
0 can i give a place zero stars ? or better yet , a negative rating ? no ? well then i 'll just write out why that might need to be introduced -lrb- at least zero stars -rrb- and i 'll let you decide . next coffee sucks . the

3 the menu reminds me of panera bread and as it turns out , they 're the same company . they 're salads are delicious and are made to order . you can switch out veggies too , and change up the dressing as well . the cookies were n't to-die-for
3 great korean market near tempe -lrb- asu -rrb- area . they pretty much sell everything from meat -lrb- fresh & frozen -rrb- , dried foods , korean snacks , rice , ice cream , some already made side dishes , ramen and even have a <unk> section . i would

4 winco is a great grocery store . i can get almost everything i need there . this place gets a bad rap and i do n't know why . here 's their angle : they do n't take credit cards -lrb- but debit is ok . and it says so
3 great homemade tortillas -lrb- nice and thick -rrb- the service is good the food is good . losing a star because they 're priced a little high , but if you go family-style and share the <unk> fajita plate -lrb- s -rrb- it <unk> the sticker shock a smidge .

2 the tasty <unk> love child of subway and quiznos , but altogether much better than both . plus the stoner basement look of the place is fun to check out while you wait for your sandwich to emerge from the toaster . only three stars because of the price of
1 i really -lrb- really really -rrb- wanted to love aiello 's . i am a <unk> <unk> of the <unk> joint , very different than the traditional <unk> meal . the catch phrase `` east coast italian '' spoke leagues of poetry to me - calamari , eggplant parm ,

4 cherry blossom is about as solid as they come . i have yet to find a dish that was anything less than delicious . there have been some that were less memorable than others , but they have all been solid . tonight 's venture consisted of two yakisoba dishes
2 cool little place . everything is super fresh and local . good ice cream - ok flavor selection . they also sell homemade cheese , milk , and butters .
2 not a bad place for a little sunday funday . . mahi tacos were pretty good . and the margarita beer ? not sure if thats what its called but it was tastey . good patio for a daytime <unk> . waitresses are a little <unk> , but i 'd
1 we went here on a tuesday around 11am . it did n't even look like the place had been cleaned from the night before . the line moved very slow and the people behind the counter seemed very unorganized . one of them did n't even know the menu items
4 what a joy to discover thai lahna with my friend keith <unk> who has been going here for over 10 years . i can see why . family owned and operated - and everyone is very friendly and helpful . of course all that matters is the food , right
4 chloe 's is an excellent place for a quick and casual lunch in north scottsdale . located in kierland commons , it has an old style counter behind which the magical grilled sandwiches are prepared . the tuna sandwich and the tuna melt are both very good . the best
4 my daughter found this phoenix gem . the little restaurant inside has the best falafel , chicken shawarma and hummus in phoenix . it beat <unk> in salt lake , too , according to my daughter , and she said that would never happen . now i find any and
4 the barrio cafe is a `` best of '' phoenix . oh my , that guacamole made at your table is fantastic . who knew that pomegranate could make it taste so good . all the dishes - especially the slow roasted pork - are excellent . we 're never
4 this sushi restaurant is the basis for what i compare all sushi on the `` west side '' to . sakana and i have shared a long term relationship for about a decade now since it first opened , and even though i 've moved to several places , and
4 after hearing so many people speak of binkley 's like it 's all <unk> and butterflies , i will admit that the phrase , `` overrated , '' probably crossed my mind several times . i just did not think that a restaurant could live up to so much ,
3 i 'm a fan mainly because of the drinks ! i thoroughly enjoyed my old fashioned drink . the bartender even put a tiny bottle of <unk> upside down in my drink which slow released as i was sipping and hanging out with friends for a birthday celebration . my
4 this was my second visit here and i loved the food again ! this time i ordered the scallops entree and it was delcious . since my hubby and his parents came with me for restaurant week , we could choose the scallops , meatloaf , or `` smart chicken
2 this little coffee shop off of cactus and the 51 freeway is similar to finding a ring in a cracker jax box . it 's totally unexpected . the surrounding area is so `` ho hum '' and almost sketch , you would never think you would find a cute

3 i love this restaurant . gourmet food in a nice and relaxed setting in one of the nicer neighborhoods of downtown phoenix . the prices are more than fair for what you get and you do n't get the <unk> attitude usually associated with `` fine-dining '' a mix of
4 there 's enough reviews of the <unk> to make it simple enough for me to say this is hands down my favorite place to get a beer in phoenix . it really feels like i 'm at home anytime i walk into this place . best tap selection downtown and

3 best place to catch some <unk> ! i have n't been attending many games this year but this place never disappoints . i am glad that chase is offering healthier food items . i do love to have a turkey burger and a beer a the game .

3 wow ! this is a beautiful spring training stadium ! i was able to attend the season opener of the d-backs and rockies and loved this place . it did take what seemed forever to get a parking and i am sure that they have worked out the kinks .
3 waffle me !!! great place for brunch but sometimes you will have to wait . i have never had any complaints about the food or service . food comes out fast and hot . the staff are helpful and very welcoming . ask for rachel ... she 's the best
2 i recently went to fuego to use my groupon and enjoy some good eats . this place is a little hidden but the menu is awesome . when we got there we had to wait for the wait staff to find a table . for a thursday night the place
3 my first visit to stand up live and it was hilarious ! i saw chris <unk> and several local comedians for <unk> 's <unk> firefighters benefit . the comedians brought laughter to such a sober event . the staff at sul were amazing . we were running a bit late
4 best dive bar in old town ! this is the place to have drinks with friends . best place to bring the out-of-towners . coach house is tiny and it should never change . i do n't recommend people with attitudes coming here if you ca n't stand being in
3 oh , <unk> , this place was delicious . just a cornucopia of scrumptious flavors . i had the braised short rib , green beans and chipotle mashed potatoes , and everything was insanely tasty . the layout is odd -lrb- we were in some sort of <unk> <unk> that
2 i loved the environment -lrb- quiet and sleek -rrb- and the coffee was good enough , but copper star 's free wireless internet was completely <unk> . i 'd hoped to do some work , but an endless parade of <unk> drove me to more friendly internet confines at lola
4 i 've loved nearly every zoo i 've been to in my life -lrb- which is basically limited to the oregon zoo in portland and zoo <unk> -rrb- , but the phoenix zoo is easily the most kid-friendly . we really enjoy it here . if you 've got a

3 we went here tonight to see jo <unk> . i have never been to a comedy show before at an improv theater so it was a new experience . this place is pretty rad . you can eat dinner here before the show , so its perfect for date night
3 we came here for lunch today and were seated and helped instantly . the lunch bowls are a great deal . you get rice , your choice of meat , and a side cup of soup for under $ 9 . if you get a beverage it ends up being
4 `` last of the summer wine '' - for anyone who is n't a british comedy fan - this comedy provides the audience with an escape and a relaxed stroll through the green rolling hills near a small english village . time feels endless ; a day never seems to
4 you have got to be kidding me !!! yupha 's is now up to <unk> reviews . there is no way that anyone would look at all <unk> reviews before selecting this as the place to go for a fantastic thai lunch or dinner . i took a visiting family
4 excellent customer service ! even with happy hour in full swing and the place full of parched <unk> , the service at our large table was spot on . we barely had time to settle our bums and push the silver out to claim our table territory before iced <unk>

4 i eat at greek wraps more than any other restaurant i think . i really love it !! the only thing i have left to try is the pork ... my fav is either the gyro plate or the chicken shawarma pita . the way to go is to get
4 honestly , one of the most amazing and delicious sandwiches i have ever had !! that dressing is garlic heaven , the sandwich was loaded with meat but balanced with the other ingredients well , the bread was perfect ! my eleven year old just freaked out at how amazing
4 i got to get my dream sandwich the other day , a veggie sandwich loaded with garlic butter and cheeses . it was perfect . i do have to mention that they messed up the order , wrong breads , wrong additions , etc. . . thankfully it made mine
4 this is our go to spot to catch a movie . not a single thing to complain about .
4 peanut butter and jelly is the best !!!!!!!!!!!!!
3 i was being treated to a mother 's day dinner by my younger sis , along with my older sis . vincents was the perfect place to go . the lobster bisque = 10 stars !! it was soo amazing ! rich , sinful , <unk> ... tomato and cheese
4 the hubby and i stopped in for lunch , we are trying to eat healthy , so i asked what i should order , so i ordered the rice noodle with shrimp and the hubby had to get his shaking beef he always orders . the waitress was sooooo super
3 their coffees are pretty good . i like my coffees black and their coffees generally have pretty good flavor . but if you chase the milky sweetened coffee drinks , i got ta recommend the caramel <unk> or the himalayan hammer . hammer 's one of their most popular products
3 wowie what an amazing pizzeria ! these guys know how to handle ingredients well and employ them in amazing ways to create an absolutely phenomenal pie ! fantastic !! lgo 's also taught me a valuable lesson . sometimes , the best pizzas are n't the <unk> ones but the

4 this may be one of the most romantic restaurants in phoenix , but there was nothing romantic about the way i devoured my food today at coup des tartes , and i mean that in the nicest way possible . i found coup des tartes on a whim and decided
3 copper star is where i go to buy drip coffee to make at home . and where i meet up for coffee on weekends and evenings with friends . when you can find parking -lrb- though i prefer walking or biking -rrb- , the atmosphere there is so relaxed you

1 i do n't quite understand what this place is trying to be . it 's like an odd combination of take out and dine in that ended up just being more than i could take on a rushed evening in between films . a friend and i arrived with two
2 i went to 5th avenue cafe today ready to have some brunch -lrb- well breakfast food really -rrb- . i absolutely love breakfast . aside from ice cream , it 's my favorite . the atmosphere was okay . we were at a huge table off to the side due

2 ok , so i had to try the concept eventually . it certainly is n't the only chain to work with a very limited menu . the food was ok . the service was pleasant . enough people must like the place as noon was approaching it got pretty full
3 so i missed the yelp uye but 2 months later smunch visited and i made it . this time , as opposed to the uye at the scottsdale location , i did indeed have a chicken and waffle along with cheesy grits . good stuff ! this is one of
2 stopped in there this morning with the idea of getting some more sausage gravy on biscuits which i thought were really good the first time i had them . it appears the week after my last breakfast there they stopped serving breakfast and now open at 10 instead of 8
2 it was an ok sandwich . the quality of the meat was very good . the bread sort of became non existent before i was done . the cole slaw was decent . my friend got excited about some hard to find items she saw in their deli case .
2 i had lunch there yesterday with some folks as part of this month 's yelp office hours . it would fit right in in a retirement community . right from the <unk> outside paint to the interior . i had a grilled cheese sandwich and a cup of clam chowder
2 i am sitting here working through the remains of last nights dinner . granted i can not eat like the healthy 20 something i once was but i do not eat like a bird either . i had the small garlic hummus plate and chicken tiki marsala -lrb- $ 15
3 was here for a breakfast club uye . what a wonderful setting for breakfast . not many menu choices but we all found something to eat and nobody had any complaints about how it came . our waitress was very nice . after our meal several of us strolled around
1 i just did n't get it . the <unk> are great . maybe i ordered the wrong menu items for my taste buds but i was n't that impressed with the food . and the pork had a bunch of fat . i had the cookie for mid afternoon snack
3 if you had mentioned to me a few years ago that a group of friends were having brunch at a vegan restaurant i would have found a reason to be busy that day . one thing the friends i have made directly and <unk> through yelp is i have yet
3 ever since el paso closed down i have been looking for ribs i like as well . i found them ! i was surprised the place was as quiet as it was early on a saturday evening . i was informed by my date that cave creek businesses suffer in

1 well , after a year and a few months of living a stones throw from breadfruit , i finally made it in there . to be honest with you i was not very impressed and left with a bad taste in my mouth . i love supporting the local restaurants
3 as you may have read in a previous review , so graciously provided by dally , that four peaks is our <unk> night hockey watering hole . we normally show up stinky and <unk> or in some sour mood or another . somehow we always leave a little happier ,
1 i have been to shady 's on a handful of occasions and always seems to be the last stop . it also seems to leave a bad taste in my mouth . you ever have a place th people like to go and they drag you along and you just
3 finally got to try matt 's early one sunday morning with the family . luckily they arrived well before i did and i did n't have to wait very long . the place is small , like previous posters have alluded too . you do n't get how small until
0 loud , obnoxious music . obscene wait to get in . an even more obscene wait to get a drink . ridiculous patrons . the feeling of either being a sardine or herded cattle , take your pick . i can say that i will not choose to come here
3 good coffee , good food , gluten free options for everything , great atmosphere -lrb- especially in off summer months -rrb- . i really enjoy this place ! it 's a grocery store too and has a ton of great healthy options for food to take home . if i
4 what a great place ! i first heard about it from their tv commercial then i looked it up online . we took <unk> yesterday and we all had a ton of fun ! we built <unk> , rode through a bike wash -lrb- kind of like a car wash
3 what a great place ! i truly enjoyed just hanging out and looking at all the stuff . <unk> had a blast playing in the <unk> and i <unk> out taking pictures . a great place to spend the afternoon . might i suggest hitting the light rail and checking
3 based on the happy hour its a decent place . 4-6pm daily and i think a reverse happy hour as well . sunday is when the draft beer is <unk> for $ 3 a pint -lrb- kiltlifter and stella -rrb- which is the best time i would like to go
1 happy hour <unk> with 1/2 off apps and $ 1 off drinks , <unk> dee do . other daily specials but nothing <unk> . some of their wings are terrible . stay away from the hot and sticky habanero , its near <unk> . other wings are mediocre at best
1 one star is for the tvs . good amount of them , and a couple giant ones . i guess it depends what game -lrb- s -rrb- they have on them for one to care . 2 floors which is kinda cool . one star for the possible specials .
3 i 've heard so much about five guys , so of course we had to try it . we went with some friends that like it . my wife is an in-n-out fan , but for the record i would n't say i love in-n-out , but it 's okay
3 we went here while on a trip home to visit family . our foodie friends told us about this place so we made the drive from the qc to check it out . we went on a monday night and it was n't too busy . we waited about 10
2 solid mexican american food . the place is like a old house with very low ceilings . the service is very non memorable . serving sizes were quite large .
2 with this opening up <unk> across the street from what i would consider the best indian buffet in town i had to try it . i meant they are setting themselves up for failure by doing that ! <unk> surprised . much nicer location than kebab . the only downside
1 this place really fell off for us with this last visit . we tried all new things and they were all terrible . sicilian pizza was awful . burger of the day was tasteless . grilled cheese sandwich with bacon was the bed thing by far and it was just
0 had a very bad experience here . first off , many of the photos posted on yelp do n't actually exist on the menu . they are from some catering company which you will not be able to order from . we ended up getting a wrap , thai ribs
1 i love wings as much as anyone but this place loses me with their over preparation of its wings . every sauce seemed to be loaded with thick syrupy candy . tasting any chicken is an afterthought with these wings , its all about the sauces . which to me
0 wow . we must have went on a bad day or something . burnt popcorn , tasteless food in super super tiny portions . majorly bummed on this place . we drove 40 miles to try it . waste of gas . guess thats what we get for going on
1 i seriously do n't see what pizza all these great reviews were eating . very bland pizza and nothing like the grimaldis in ny !
3 solid salads and pizza served by mostly hot young girls wearing tight shorts . not sure how you can really go wrong . no wonder all the mormon dads choose it as # 1 . -lrb- that was a joke about how horny <unk> are -rrb- everything other than the
1 meh tasteless food in an excellent atmosphere . if you want this style of food done right look to a place more like chompies or even <unk> deli . the food here is quite average at best .
4 i love you and see you soon .
3 great hike with your dog ! took my 6 yr old dog for her first mountain hike and she kicked ass ! we hiked the south side of the mountain up to the stone hut at the top . great views to be had and really reminds you of how
3 fantastic ! the sweet potato fries <unk> the show . the burgers are great and the beer selection is only second to the yard house . i may or may not have had six too many beers on more than one occasion . there is a reason this place gets

3 the food being served from within a restaurant can partially be defined by the feeling of its surroundings . for this , revo is a definite 5 stars ... or more if you count all the star lighting from the ceiling ! okay , okay ... i ca n't deny
2 looks like they are <unk> for a liquor license ... exciting !
4 great homemade gelato - great coffee - great service .
3 really glad to see rudy 's move into az . . i ate there all the time in austin . they would get 5 stars if they 'd add some sides that were reasonably healthy ... green salad , steamed veggies , etc. . . i never eat there ,
3 breakfast here is some of the best ... nothing crazy out-of-this-world different mind you , but good quality , good portions for a reasonable price . the coffee is good too , not weak like most places . they have a flavored coffee special everyday ... some are good ,
2 i go here for some things on occasion ... they make good <unk> and i can get a few things that are not in many other places . other than that , they are expensive ... similar to whole paycheck foods so for the majority of the items i need
2 this is not going to blow your sox off ... but they food is consistent , good variety , and decent quality . i like their green chili best . pretty much all i get there now when i go .
1 in general sky harbor is lacking in almost every way . it must be the most <unk> major airport in the us because you can tell they do n't spend any money making it a nice place . this review has sections : food , terminal spaces quality , security
4 i can not say enough good things about this place , just go ! service is excellent , food is always top notch . i 've had nearly everything on the menu . i 'm very picky with my food and all the dishes rates ` above average ' up
3 there is no place like <unk> pizzeria da michele , but you need to be in naples italy to eat there . most pizza in italy is really not great like they make you believe . it is almost as hard to find great pizza in italy as it is
4 i have been waiting to write this review until i was really inspired , because i wanted to do this place justice . sitting at a coffee shop , a little <unk> , listening to some amazing <unk> in the sky in my <unk> , i finally feel i 'm
4 love cartel scottsdale . all of the <unk> , however especially the old town scottsdale location . this place used to be an <unk> owned coffee house owned by a church i think , and even though now it is a chain it has maintained that amazing independant feel .
2 fancy place . perfect for a nice date or a birthday dinner . never packed , but still in a great area . close to old town .
0 talk about a lame chain of a resturant ! just because you slap on a home town <unk> 's name on the front of a building does not mean you should ever go there . the food is terrible and expensive - bad combination . bartenders poor mad weak ,
1 the mm is a total meh bar/restaurant . they have your typical ` okay ' pizza , an average beer menu but nothing great . this just happens to be one of those places you go because a buddy is there with a group of friends and you get that
4 some places are just so a part of your childhood that they always remain a favorite . la pinata is one of those , i have been going here since before i was born ... no seriously , my family has been regulars for decades . kids grow up and

2 i have been to both locations you know were <unk> 's use to be now that place was the best place i sure do miss <unk> 's ... but back to the review in my mind i go to a place to eat good food and this was not what

3 the vig is a great spot for lunch , dinner , or late-night for some damn decent food , served up relatively quickly , and with a good variety of dishes to boot . we showed up around 9:30 pm on a friday night and there was no wait ,
3 chuckbox is a classic , a great , juicy burger with tons of flavor from their mesquite grill , <unk> fries , and a fixins bar that 's real nice . they offer up a few extras , like a great chicken sandwich , but the star here is the
4 wow this pizza is fantastic . absolutely fantastic . we had the mozzarella margherita , which was one of their `` napoletana certified '' flavors , and it was exceptional . they use imported san marzano tomatoes and imported <unk> and they blend together in this perfect way that packs
3 i 'm not a sushi expert by any stretch , but suffice to say that the rolls here are well-priced , <unk> , and overall pretty damn delicious , with good presentation . i 'm not a fan of their tea , but that 's just a personal preference ,
4 smashburger provides absolutely fantastic tasting burgers . there is a great deal of flavor in each burger and it 's delicious . the bun is great , the cheese is great , the burger is great . the smash fries are really quite good as well , though they can
4 the chicken <unk> is the absolute best chicken meal i have ever had in my entire life . about a year ago , i first visited tricks . i was debating between the chicken <unk> and the airplane chicken . i asked the waiter who replied , `` the airplane

2 i come here for the produce . sprouts is about <unk> from my home , but for whatever reason , the stuff at <unk> just <unk> my bells . yeah they have tons of other good reasons to shop here , but i do n't get into it that much
3 i walked in the front door . the sign said , `` <unk> wednesday ! <unk> like a <unk> for a dollar off your meal ! '' the guy behind the register looked down at my black tee <unk> with a bold <unk> logo of <unk> and <unk> , ``
3 now i have a second favorite steak house in town ! the first being bourbon steak -lrb- i 'm a duck fat fry guy -rrb- most everything was terrific here . some of the hard things to accept are the wine prices . . paying $ 98 for a $

1 this place is decent for lunch but a total bomb for dinner . the fresh food case is totally underwhelming . the place has very good sandwiches -lrb- i think they use boar 's head -rrb- with good bread . they seem to also have a good selection of cheeses
4 great food . 52 different beers . i would recommend to watch games or just to eat . <unk> brle was great
2 trying out bingo as its new here . pros and cons . they do have a true non smoking section , but you have to go smoking to get beverages . also vents are on the floor which makes it extremely cold . food is expensive i thought , but
4 good view for concert
3 went for the first time last weekend . we split the aaron 's sandwich which is a combo of pastrami and corned beef - swapped out the swiss cheese for american and the pickles were so good we had to ask for more ! the sandwich was delicious ! perfectly
2 we 've been here a couple of time . the first time we went with friends . i had the eggplant parm . it was very good . not an overly huge portion but it had all the components that made it good , tasty sauce , served hot ,
2 my best friend <unk> and i decided to give culinary dropout a whirl before heading home to work on an exam . it was thursday last week , so my review is a little late . the place has a cool , unique decor . kind of <unk> with a

3 i had heard that mijana serves <unk> , and so i decided to wander in ... especially since i have n't been able to find <unk> since i moved to the valley almost 4 years ago ! they used to carry it at trader joe 's but for some reason
3 returned again a couple of nights ago and the service was much better ! had the pad thai , shrimp peanut curry , and the pork ribs . pad thai was good but , a little too much sugar for my taste ... shrimp curry was delightfully good . .
2 after a long hiatus the wife and i decided to stop in on a <unk> . evening and have some sushi ... but as history <unk> itself ... yasu 's special bistro offerings drew me in ! enjoyed some excellent albacore <unk> , ocean trout carpaccio , kumamoto 's ,

4 top restaurant i have ever been to in arizona or even on the west coast . . once you start walking into the pub you feel like you have suddenly traveled over the pond and back to america 's roots british food ! i have always heard horrible things about
2 if you want to cool off on a hot day fat tuesdays is the place i prefer happy hour because getting a deal always makes me a happy camper ! this place is dead a lot - so if you are looking to rage this is not the place but
1 bland and lackluster food that is not worth the price or the wait to get it . we had lunch at nourish a few months ago and while we were n't overly impressed , as they do serve healthy food that is in line with our whole foods , <unk>
3 we had a great dining experience here and will definitely be back to try out some of the other items on the menu . we stopped in on a tuesday night and despite the fact that the place was nowhere near full , the bar area seemed a bit loud
0 a very poor excuse for mexican food . we arrived at lunch to find the place packed and had a bit of a wait , which despite the run-down lackluster interior , we viewed the popularity as a positive sign that we were in for some great food . we
1 most of the stuff here is new , not used , and these are not thrift store prices . you can randomly find some deals on name brand stuff like <unk> and lucky jeans , but i do n't usually even bother stopping in here anymore . they have shoes
4 after <unk> 's <unk> out , marquee stepped in to take most medium-sized shows , and i have to say as much as i loved <unk> 's i like the marquee . formerly the grand river <unk> -lrb- or something -rrb- , they tore out the seats , so it

4 it was everything i dreamed it would be : greasy , fatty , salty , sweet , syrupy , buttery - delicious . it 's worth the hype . i ate it all and regret nothing . well done , lolo 's .
2 huh . i would definitely not call this a `` scottsdale '' type bar with that kind of crowd at all . i do n't come often , but whenever i 've gone it 's been just good ol' beer drinking folk and/or the heavily tattooed crowd , and not

3 i love this place , but i have to admit , it 's really not a ` date ' place . well , let me <unk> , it 's not a good ` first date ' place . the converted post office has terrible acoustics and it gets really loud
4 just went here last night for the first time after a visit to the museum , and it was everything i had heard and more - i was not disappointed . beautiful historic home turned <unk> restaurant , in the style of coup de tartes or house of tricks .
2 food is ok . pad thai is sub-par . the happy hour is very cool baby suburban around this joint . it 's attached to chandler fashion center , so it 's busy pretty much all of the time . happy hour specials are just ok , specialty drinks are
4 <unk> . dean 's upgrading the patio seating area , with big tables/booths and a cover to block out the sun . think casey 's , but with way better food and in mesa . can this place get any better ??
3 i love this hotel and its accompanying restaurant , gallo blanco , so much that i spent my wedding night here . the small boutique hotel is a phoenix gem and you wo n't be disappointed with a stay here , which will be unique and memorable . the lobby
3 i think this place is great for not a special occasion , but say , a better night than usual ... it 's right in downtown scottsdale , but around the center for the arts area , so you get some hipster types along with the club types . the
3 oh yucky tap , i hardly know ye ! checked out the new expansion last night and i have to say i 'm quite impressed . they took over some greasy food joint next door and instead of knocking out a wall and <unk> ' ` er up , they

3 this restaurant is so gaudy it 's amazing . plenty of fat tony types <unk> about and chit chatting with the regulars , the food is unbelievably good ... but it ` <unk> the decor <unk> makes this place awesome . the bar area is an explosion of 70s disco
3 went to la bocca a few times and enjoyed each visit . atmosphere is very cool and trendy . really good artisan style pizzas with bubbly crispy crust and fresh toppings . mediterranean platter is also very good -lrb- hummus , babaganoush with feta , pita <unk> and rustic bread
2 this place is a small korean <unk> . i read all the reviews on how this place does n't compare to mekong or lee lee , but i had to go for some good authentic kimchi -lrb- which those <unk> do n't have -rrb- . the stores aisles are so
3 i like the variety of food that this place has to offer , but i often order the pizza because it 's really good . the service is always exceptional . on nice days it 's really nice to sit in their outdoor patio area . sushi is pretty good
1 casual and laid back bar with a great patio area . service is usually pretty good as is the food . only complaint is their margaritas taste like <unk> . and they recently replaced my malibu rum with ... yes , that fake <unk> bay sh * t . they
4 indie film heaven , folks . not the recycled garbage showing at mainstream theatres . i 've been to dozens of movies here . always friendly attendants , and a few times they 've let us come in with our outside food . of course , we ordered from their
3 ride the bulls gals and put on a show : -rrb- just wear pants , please !! fun spot to get drunk and do <unk> things with cotton candy ! great happy hour specials ! extremely generous bartenders and huge portions of food . well worth the money !!
2 been around the corner from this place for a couple years , guess it 's about time my <unk> brought me in ... a good mix of happy hours specials from appetizers to salads . from spicy potstickers to salads , they 've got a lot of variety . the
1 food was mediocre and the rental rates for a room to sing karaoke were pricey . it took the waitress a bit to get drinks so the buzz never really <unk> in . an empty glass in a bar is a waste . not overly generous on the booze either
1 as a fb fan , i was offered free <unk> vodka drinks - for me and a few of my friends - for an hour if we came in during happy hour . i said , `` what the heck , why not ? '' and rounded up a few
2 i go for the friends , food and fun . no malibu . so it 's hard to come here for happy hour and enjoy the hustle and bustle of things . i will indulge my peeps and meet them here although they always feel bad for forgetting i am

3 it 's been a while since i 've been to delux , but i do keep meaning to go back . their burgers are a nice change of pace from the typical fast food variety . order up a `` basket '' -lrb- served in a miniature shopping cart -rrb-
4 pane bianco does n't offer a <unk> menu , but you wo n't care about a huge selection after you take the first bite of your sandwich or salad . a brick oven in the center of the restaurant <unk> fresh bread on a daily basis . it 's crispy
4 karsh 's bakery can be found in an almost hidden location of a shopping complex at the corner of 7th street and missouri . the same owners who opened the bakery in <unk> still run it to this day . you will find a variety of bakery items to help
4 just had an amazing experience ! hate to admit this but hands down one of the best pizzas i have had ! the staff was great and very friendly . i was craving an after dinner caffeine fix and our bartender recommended the cutest little espresso drink ... i told

2 after hearing good things about this place for years my wife and i finally decided to try postino 's . we went on a monday evening just after happy hour , and were seated quickly . we were asked almost immediately if we were ready to order , but having
3 donuts are delicious , my wife has yet to find any better in the east valley . however , service is lackluster and the boba tea is foul . so , skip the boba , but enjoy the donuts . if you really want to kiss up at work ,
3 the staff is always friendly and helpful if you need to locate an item . there are many great items to choose from here and the prices are very affordable . i think the one exception is some fruits and <unk> can be a little expensive for the amount you

3 finally , i 've been able to see a game at municipal stadium . the last time i went to a game in 2006 , the game was rained out . there is n't a bad seat in the house . the stadium is a bit smaller than several other

4 each time i 've hit the gelato spot , the place has been busy ! there are many flavors too choose from . i generally go with the fruit flavors with strawberry , mango and pineapple being my favorite . after my last trip , i indulged myself and went
2 i 've been here twice . the last time i got the pulled pork , but sampled my wife 's plate of ribs and brisket . the best meat is the pulled pork hands down . the pork is tender and has little fat . the brisket is ok ,

4 damn this place is yummy . i just moved to glendale and was happy to see there 's a location over there . so i will be going there a lot . i 've been tot his location twice with some friends and the service is incredible . my girlfriend
1 overpriced and mediocre food at best . the reason i gave this two stars is because you can buy cool shirts . who does n't want a hard rock cafe phoenix shirt ? ... heh . i think the nostalgia has worn off on the hard rock cafe after all
4 ive never been much for trying new places ... mainly because im usually disappointed . so i stick with what i know . hula 's was a new place and by the stars above you can imagine how my visit was . we had put in reservations for 25 people
2 ive never been a huge fan of cheesecake except for their amazing cheesecake . what i have eaten here , ive been happy with . first off , when you go there and sit down , they give you a catalog style menu that 's about 20 pages long mixed
4 ive been here three times . . and i think i can finally make an honest review . i do n't care what pizza you 've had , or what sandwich you 've eaten , or what wing you 've devoured . you must try pullano 's . for years

3 so we finally tried <unk> . we had a chicken burrito , enchilada-style with red sauce . we also took home chips and salsa , as well as some cinnamon crisps . the prices were good , the service was fast , and the owner was super friendly , even
1 i love harkins but some locations need an upgrade . for the upscale customers that visit this mall the theater should be just as upscale . it fails at meeting the customers taste in the finer things .
3 giving it a 4 stars cuz i fell in love with the pizza muffins . yeah i said it i love these things that remind me of a really good cinnamon roll only made with pizza dough and toppings . yummy . . our waiter was very nice and our

3 good * little * spot for tasty burgers and tacos . i see lots of people checking in here all the time , and they 've got a solid four star rating , of course i wanted to check the place out . then deal chicken had a run on

3 i must be dreaming , 'cause this place is just too cool . tucked in side an easy to miss house with a barely noticeable sign even during the day , find yourself sipping down a bottle of your favorite libation or have them pour you a locally brewed craft

3 i love fez ! i have had great food and drinks whether it 's been in the evening for dinner and drinks or on sunday for brunch . my favorite is their brunch ; my biggest problem is trying to decide exactly which item i want to get . between
1 i really wanted to love luci 's . sadly , i did not . my parents are old , really old . due to their chronic <unk> , they tend to have <unk> habits . since i am not old , i do n't share many of these <unk> .
4 because it 's friday and i 'm in the mood to celebrate , it 's time to review the ultimate disneyland for drunks . total wine , you are the bees knees . the proper mindset for this review should not be `` i 'd like a beer with dinner
3 this review is based solely on the market , since i have n't actually ordered food here . that being said , la tolteca rocks . there 's a christmas tradition that i partake of , and it <unk> me all sorts of problems . every year i cater a
4 i never really had sweet tooth . given the choice between a piece of cake or a pickle , the pickle wins every time . urban cookies has changed me . i 've sampled just about every cupcake that 's offered , and here are a few highlights : the
4 by now we 're all perfectly aware that food trucks are a thing , and a wonderful thing at that . i 've sampled wares from every truck i see , and i can honestly say that torched goodness is a favorite of mine . i 'm no expert when
1 with all the great reviews and seeing as how crowded it was , i was really sad that my experience was n't the same . it 's been a long time since i 've been to the ones in tx but i certainly do n't remember the experience being that
2 <unk> - the two reasons i come are the two reasons i ca n't give this place what could be it 's due worth . i came specifically to try their salsas and their horchata . unfortunately i never really got to try either b/c they had run out pretty
2 i just moved here and am always trying to find good food -lrb- oh wait , i do that anywhere i go ... -rrb- but imagine my surprise when i found a cambodian place here in phoenix . i love eating it at the places back home so i was
2 love the concept but not completely sold on the food . there were a couple of good things and a couple not so good . roasted rosemary cheese appetizer - yummy ! it 's roasted brie with salt and rosemary on top served with a side of this yummy <unk>
3 been here several times to watch games or the draft . the best thing here are the ko 's <unk> sauce wings . not overly tangy like buffalo wings . good flavor and pretty meaty . i like that their pizzas are thin crust . good service .
3 been here 3 times so far . the staff has treated me and my family well , the food i got tasted very good , and the beers have been good as well . i 'm not sure where these bad reviews came from because i 've never had the
2 wow . this bookmans feels different from my usual stores . neither better nor worse ... interestingly different . just wish they were n't being <unk> by the construction so much .
4 i 've been going to the arizona renaissance festival for years now . it 's a total blast in my opinion . there are a variety of shows and events that range from family friendly to <unk> . they include the obligatory <unk> , comedy , <unk> , music ,
3 you got ta hand it to buffalo wild wings : they are the place to go for football on a sunday . with tvs lining the walls , you are definitely going to find the game you came in for . it should be noted that sundays are packed -
3 if you 're looking for a local coffee shop in southern tempe , solo coffee is your place . locally owned and roasting great coffee from <unk> , this is a staple . solo is n't large and spacious , but more <unk> and eclectic . local art covers the
3 i 've tried a lot of sushi places in phoenix , but this is my favorite ! the best and worst part about yen sushi : they have great specials every night after 8pm . they place a lot of their quality rolls on `` happy hour '' for only
4 of all the outdoor malls in phoenix -lrb- and i 've been to a lot of them -rrb- , tempe marketplace is the best ! it 's a one stop shop for all of your needs . if you 're hungry , tempe marketplace has a great selection of places
3 highly recommend eating at vito 's . i have eaten there several times ; always good service ; great food . i am not a pizza eater but enjoy their pizza . you can not go wrong going to vito 's for a meal . was introduced to vito 's
3 one of my favorite places . had dinner there last night . tried their cheese cake -lsb- new -rsb- - very , very good . highly recommend visiting the tqla , i believe you will enjoy .
3 great place to visit . urge you to visit the desert botanical garden . want to see desert plants in their habitat ; this is the place to go . make the desert botanical garden you next trip . i know you will enjoy the visit .
3 visit tqla at least once a week . love their salsa 's . great desserts . especially like their taco salad . have eaten several of their luncheon specials and found them to all be good . , highly recommend visiting and enjoying the food and drink .
3 we celebrated my bf 's bday here and it has to be the best brunswick i 've ever been to . it was basically like a lucky strike or xxx , just a little more kid friendly . the bar was way better than the usual bar you see in
4 i have never been a fan of philly cheesesteaks , ever . i 've tried to , but i just never found them to be tasty . but last night i had one from here after leaving the bars and i was amazed ! i got it with onions and
4 oh dear god ! this place is so amazing . i seriously do n't know how the lines are n't out the door and around the corner ! my sister lives nearby and she <unk> that we try it . boy , was she right when she said it 's
4 i 've been here a couple of times with the bf and i 've had a great time every time . they have good food and i love how when the <unk> is put up it feels like were watching a gigantic tv on our couch in the living room
4 another one of my favorite spots in central phoenix ! windsor is close to my sister 's place so she took us here a while back . we have since been back many times after that ! windsor is super classy and has great food for a great price .
4 i love the valley ho ! i threw my sister 's bachelorette party in scottsdale and the valley ho immediately came to mind . i knew the weather was going to be amazing outside so i was excited to see that they had the terrace suite . the terrace suite
4 i love ono ! at first i had the thought that this place charges way too much for a plate , then i saw the portions . we ordered the chicken katsu meal and the short ribs meal and it was enormous ! the chicken was so crispy and went
3 i recently watched a movie here with the bf and it was only $ 6 for both of us ! this theater makes me reminisce about going to the dollar theater growing up in california . unlike other cheap theaters this one is clean , the staff is nice and
4 my husband ate here one day for lunch , and wanted to go back that night for dinner . it 's that good ! i tried it the next day and i would have gone back the same night for dinner , too , if i would n't have still
4 yum !! fresh flavors , great service , moderate price . ca n't wait to bring my mom here when she visits phoenix next time !
2 i suppose it 's good ... for what it is : a generic , chain restaurant eerily similar to houston 's , or hillstone , or whatever the hell generic shit it is . it is n't that the food that i ordered was not good , but it was
2 meh . tiniest portions ever ! i paid $ 3 for the <unk> serving of a side of fruit i have ever seen in my life . literally , 6 bite sized pieces of fruit ... for three dollars . same with all the other sides . if you are
3 i love pita jungle just as much as the next person , but i have experienced seriously inconsistencies between all 4 locations i 've frequented . sometimes the food -lrb- esp the hummus -rrb- is so incredibly salty that i ca n't even taste the hummus for what it is
3 this place certainly delivers on the ambiance factor , but ... $ 14 for a salad ? really ? and $ 9 for a plate of kale ? really ? i think this place needs to get over themselves on the food pricing . mind you ... that kale salad
3 i went here once and i can not stop dreaming about the roasted corn pizza ! the goat cheese on it was perfect and the roasted sweet corn added a nice pop to every bite ! i also ordered the pizzeria chopped salad which was just okay , it was
4 out of all of the local indian restaurants i have tried , royal taj is by far the best ! the curries are amazing and the meat -lrb- and paneer -rrb- is always tasty ! while the people who own the restaurant may seem a bit distant , they are
4 chill is amazing ! the gelato is amazing and so are the <unk> choices ! sandy is so kind and welcoming and very well trained in the art of making gelato ! the prices are also incredible ! be sure to try the cake batter flavor !
1 i 've tried several of their dishes . it 's ok . i did like their cocktail de <unk> but nothing special .
0 i 've been there 2-3 times , enough to give them a chance and enough to know i 'm not going back for meat purchases . not very friendly service and way overpriced . i 've found better service , better cuts , and 50 % of the price .
4 love the <unk> . excellent ingredients and mostly local !
4 one of the best donuts i 've had in my life ! apple fritter is to heavenly . addicting ... check . <unk> ... check . is n't part of my <unk> diet ... check .
3 i went here a short time ago with a social networking group . i 'm now a firm believer that downtown phoenix is on the comeback trail . i 'd tried a couple of other joints in the neighborhood including matt 's big breakfast and fate , so this seemed
4 now here 's a restaurant that knows how to do arizona restaurant week right . went here my brother over the weekend after a d'backs game . the place was n't that busy and we got excellent service throughout . the place is on the bottom floor of the westin
2 love the vibe here , but the food was a little disappointing . this used to be the old public market grocery store , but after the store closed , the owners of st francis restored it as an all day caf serving farm to table foods . the concept
3 its been a couple years since i last set foot here and quite a bit has changed . went to <unk> recently , but had n't had a chance to check out the breadfruit and its updated menu until tonight . the original place is still largely in <unk> ,
3 nice little neighborhood bakery . i have n't had their cookies yet , but their cupcakes are awesome . great variety to choose from . my favs include the chocolate , lemon , brown velvet , and golden <unk> -lrb- yes , those golden <unk> -rrb- . i was worried
3 everything you 've heard about the stetson chopped salad is true . when my family and i booked this place for arizona restaurant week , we did so with the promise from friends that we would have a salad we 'd never forget . they were right . in addition
2 its a restaurant that 's still very much in its <unk> and still has some kinks to work out , but so far this new downtown spot is off to a pretty good start . my siblings and i took my dad here for father 's day . surprisingly ,
3 we were in town and wanted to try some of the ddd recommended locations . we only came here because matt 's was so small and crowded . glad we came by , it 's not the best place in town . but we really enjoyed the wolfpack , service
3 this is a nice theater , only came here for a special engagement showing of the 25 anniversary of the <unk> of the opera . had a very good time , seats are very comfy , had enough leg room . popcorn was very good , prices are a little
4 love this place , only lived in the phoenix area for a year and have already been here at least ten times . first , if you are picking up family . they have two cell parking lots ! you can park there and wait for your guest to call
1 well , we knew what we were getting our self into when we decided to try this joint ! and we were right , besides the good looking girls , this place is not that great ! burger was ok , i made it better with the condiments , fries
3 just moved here from socal . and it felt great not traveling just to watch an nfl game ! stadium is ok , not great ! food was good , but very expensive . but overall the family and i had a very good time . i am not complaining
3 my review is for the happy hour . this place is packed for happy hour basically every day . recently , my wife and i were lucky enough to score a table on the patio . the restaurant , bar and patio are beautiful . the patio has plenty of
2 the food tasted a-ok but i 'm not in a rush to go back . i ordered the lamb shank -lrb- $ 21 -rrb- along with the basmati rice and the <unk> salad -lrb- $ 5.50 -rrb- . i thought the lamb was decent , but it did n't make
3 looks like i got lucky and found this place after a change in management per yelper kevin s. i 've been here three times in the last month and have been very pleased with the food . i had the huge , delicious meatloaf which is very difficult to finish
1 i kind of wondered how long it would take for al 's beef to close up shop after portillo 's arrived in town . al 's closed down a week or so ago . their beef sandwiches as of the last few months were not as tasty as i remembered
1 spinato 's originated from chicago . if i lived in chicago i would be happy about them moving to az . . my wife and i shared a thin crust sausage , onion and <unk> pizza and did not enjoy it . the pizza was bland , maybe it was
2 the yogurt is great and they have the usual assortment of flavors . but unfortunately they were a little short handed on staff . i could have actually walked out of the place without paying if i wanted . but waited several minutes for the dude to <unk> from the
3 i dined at king 's fish house last night after happy hour . king 's has ample indoor and outdoor seating and was crowded . i ordered the char broiled swordfish with mashed potatoes , <unk> and a diet coke . carol was my server and did a great job
0 went there yesterday to give five guys another chance and had a cheeseburger -lrb- one patty -rrb- , fries and a soft drink for $ <unk> . i could n't even taste the burger since the <unk> bun swallowed the burger . obviously , this bun is meant for the
2 i 've been to guido 's a few times and have enjoyed the chicken parmasean sandwich , spaghetti , italian sausage sandwich and the 1/2 italian sub at today 's visit . management - please train your wait staff , i asked how large the whole and half italian sub
2 i 've been to the brat haus a couple of times . it has so much potential but i 'm going to have to pass the next time i 'm in the area . the patio is a great feature . they have some excellent beer as well . i
4 note to management - the crew you had working this past monday night is your `` a '' team . my calzone was cooked to perfection , my only regret is that i did n't take a picture of it . my dinning companions were equally impressed with the hot
3 i had a late lunch at al 's today . ordered the italian sausage with red sauce and a large drink . i got a funny look because they did n't know what red sauce was . for the uninitiated , red sauce is <unk> sauce in chicago ; i
0 i have been to ray 's twice . once for an eggplant parmasean sandwich and once for a meatball calzone . the eggplant parmasean was meh and the meatball calzone had me saying `` where 's the beef ? '' . the calzone really did n't have any taste .
3 i can not believe it has taken me this long to write a review for justina <unk> 's wonderful cyclo <unk> cuisine . we visited cyclo for the first time on the first friday after a very positive review by the arizona republic food critic howard seftel . the small
1 saigon pho falls flat years ago , my husband and i went to saigon pho regularly before choir practice to get a bowl of bun <unk> . once we quit the choir , and found cyclo , saigon pho was no longer on the radar screen . last night ,
3 having waited for an asian noodle shop to open in the east valley , i was thrilled to read good reviews about this place that was right down the road . so , on new year 's eve day , we headed to <unk> . it was filled with families
2 on our journey north to the musical instrument museum , we stopped at sapporo for lunch . the space is <unk> and hip and full of the typical scottsdale `` beautiful people . '' we started with edamame ... ca n't go wrong there . mom had the japanese chicken
2 my opinion of cpk : quinoa & arugula salad was outstanding . the fish tacos are skimpy . one taco had 2 pieces of fish that were roughly the size of fish sticks . the other taco had 2 teeny <unk> pieces of fish . i do n't like to
2 nothing extraordinary about this place . i had a house salad and a grilled halibut sandwich . the place was clean , the waitress was nice , the music was a little loud especially in the bathroom . that 's all i got .
0 bait and switch . the menu that is online is not the same menu that is in the restaurant . the online menu lists several vegetarian dishes , the restaurant menu does not . when my sister and i arrived we each knew what we were going to order ,
4 whenever my brother is in town he always stays here so when the hubby & i were looking for a place to get away for a night we stayed here . we are the not the party crowd which is why we chose to stay here on a tuesday after
4 what a lovely restaurant . it is literally tucked away on a residential street so pay close attention or you will miss it , better yet just use your gps . so , we went yesterday for a pre-birthday lunch for me and my sister . i started with the
3 we stumbled upon this place by accident and i 'm glad we did . it was a perfect day for dining outdoors which is what we did . the waitress brought out freshly baked corn bread and butter ... nice touch . i ordered the avocado turkey burger which was
3 the chicken gyro was a skimpy on the chicken . i would give that 3 stars . the roasted red pepper hummus was good . it 's regular hummus with a dollop of roasted red pepper in the center . that portion was a little skimpy too . i 'd
4 wow ! great food , friendly staff ! had the calzone and it was huge ! this is legit italian food ! worth the stop outside of downtown !
0 wow , , , , this was one of the worst experiences ever . we to have some lunch here , which was highly recommended by some friends . we sat down outside on the patio ... waited 5 minutes to get menus . ok , i understand , if
3 just hit up the bar and yep ... as good as the food ! great bartenders , very good drinks ! next time , will have to have some food !
3 cant wait to go back . perfect menu , sliders , regular and large . sliders are perfect to try a few different items . they offer exotic type of meat , based off the `` season '' . i had buffalo , and kangaroo . yeah , kangaroo .
3 always good , and close to home .
3 yumm yumm yumm ! the burgers are fantastic and yummy ! the service has always been top notch , fast and <unk> . love the inside and outside environment . could do without the tvs with sports playing on them ... do n't we get enough plugged in entertainment in
3 fantastic new back patio with stellar views and super ambience ! had a couple o ' pitchers ... some delish flat bread to nosh on ... and great service .
4 had a fantastic evening with friends and neighbors for jeff 's birthday . terrific eats and brews and drinks in this spectacular environment . thanks .
4 we went to durants for our anniversary . the service was amazing , the food was incredible . we shared a steak that was out of this world . then to top it off they brought us some sort of strawberry desert of which i 'm still having flashbacks .
3 love their burgers ! the hosts and servers are always super nice and on top of it . environment and decor is great . it is very loud and hard to hear people in a group of 4 or more ... so larger groups sit outside to be able to
3 i 've driven by this place numerous times , but it was n't until memorial day that i finally found out what it was . i was taking a photo of their corona beer bottle flags outside for an exhibit i 'm in and needed to know the address of
3 i like this place . have n't been in a while . . i should change that . they have great burgers and excellent pomegranate martinis !
2 i would give the food two stars but because i did have fun playing video games i 'll give it three stars . it was 10pm on a saturday night and gary and i had both been working non stop since 11am , we were hungry and wanted to do
3 this is my favorite place to get chinese food . it 's the only chinese restaurant without mystery meat . also the meat is not fried to death . i love the lemon chicken and the crab puffs . love love love the crab puffs . the service is always
2 it 's fun to go to every 2-3 years . i do like the ferris wheel and riding the camel and stuff like that . i also like funnel cakes a lot and having one every few years sounds perfect to me .
4 love this place so much ! i looked at a purse here for a year ... it was out of my price range ... then won a gift certificate and decided to buy that purse ! i get so many compliments on it ! i 've also bought a super
3 pub quiz ! this place has a fun , casual atmosphere and the food is quite good . they have a large assortment of drinks , but tonight , i just came for <unk> with some good friends . : -rsb-
2 cheap as cheap gets for a sit down diner . the food comes out fast , hot , and delicious . the menu is huge and the number of dishes may <unk> your mind . some dishes i would recommend are : beef stew noodle soup : the meat in
3 delicious thai food . i tried the tom yum soup which was very flavorful and delicious but a touch on the salty side . the pad thai noodles were also awesomely chewy and came with tons of mix-ins on the side like peanuts , cabbage , bean sprouts , beets
3 the burger sliders were good . stay away from the chicken sliders . the service was great and the sweet potato fries were delicious . it would have been 5 stars if i did n't order the chicken slider . oh , and a good location too .
4 wow ! christopher 's is a great restaurant . i am still new to the area and it was a little hard to locate , but worth the search . the best calamari i have had . the salmon was cooked perfectly with just the right amount of sauce to
3 yes the servers are beautiful . the food is decent . good happy hour specials . a large blue moon for $ 6.50 . the sliders were good . they did n't come as i ordered . the waitress never noticed she did n't bring a side order . the
2 a nice store , clean and very welcoming . however , they do n't carry organic fruits and vegetables . i know , hard to believe a high end store does n't have an organic fruits . on the positive note , the sushi is very good for a market
4 this is my favorite restaurant in arizona . fabulous food is masterfully prepared . i love everything about nobuo ; the quirky little rooms , the location and the vibe - and of course the food , the food , the food .
3 delicious pastrami sandwiches . split one because they are huge . had a nice large multiple ingredient salad that was rather tasteless but somehow very satisfying ... go figure . the knish was weird , not one seen in my new york days . i think the place is really
4 this is one of the 5 top reasons to live in the valley and put up with the heat . tubing <unk> talk about <unk> but hey that was 25 years ago . been lately ? we go several times a looong summer and each trip is a journey .
3 we really enjoyed this venue . what a fun concept to make a regular movie more like a night out or date . we bought our tickets online and then went late sunday afternoon . it was a manageable crowd and a pleasant movie going experience . we also happened
2 chain , chain , chain ... somehow we always spend more money here than i would like . that aside , the grilled fish tacos are so good , we come back each time we go to kierland commons . they have consistently good food but lose a star over
4 museum : this place is amazing . i love how the museum lives up to its theme that `` music is the language of the soul '' . this beautiful building is new . it is a testament to how music plays such a vital role in all cultures throughout
4 hubby and i had a belated valentine 's dinner here on saturday night and it was the best upscale meal i 've had since being back in az , hands down . i 'll preface by saying that i am not usually a huge fan of steakhouses - they 're
4 love , love , loved roaring fork ! the dining room is warm and cozy , with lots of wood and stone in the decor . usually a southwestern theme like theirs can come across as pretty casual , but they manage to make it feel like a classic ,
4 joe 's real bbq is one of my favorite places . comfort food in a comfort environment served by friendly people - just the best . located in downtown gilbert , the historic brick building is solid and homey . we try to visit at non-peak hours or on weeknights
1 i wanted to love it so much !! i do n't mind the divey old school feel , i just felt the burger was not all it 's cracked up to be . it was juicy , but under seasoned , so it did n't have much flavor . the
3 been here a few times in the last couple years . always solid and never had a problem . very cute date spot , actually the bf took me here on our first date , big points ! i recommend the <unk> -lrb- sp ? -rrb- pizza and a nutella
1 yeah , that was a $ 15 breakfast , that felt like a 6.99 breakfast . i have nostalgic feelings toward 5 & diner , so i 'll probably still go here from time to time , but really it 's not that good . i got an omelet that
3 first time eating here and it was really good . i went with the basic gyro plate . i love meats roasted on a spit ! this includes gyro meat , yellow rice , salad , hummus , pita , and portion cup of tzatziki . it is a large
3 one of my favorite , relaxed and trendy cocktail bars in phx . you must get the white rabbit cocktail , it 's amazing . there is some good people watching , and it 's great for conversation with friends . it 's a small bar , so do n't
4 i have been here for dinner twice and both times i 'm completely satisfied with my meal . the food : of course i got the chopped salad . it 's just fantastic , and i wish i lived closer to scottsdale so that i could eat it on a
3 this is my new favorite place for sandwiches . the menu had such a variety , i was sad i could only eat one meal when i was there . everyone enjoyed their food , and they made special accommodations for a birthday desert . i want to go back
1 so ... yeah ... this happened as you can tell by the price rating on durant 's , this is not a cheap restaurant . it is one of the most expensive dinners i 've had while in phoenix . so when i 'm going to dine at a restaurant
4 my wife was feeling a bit queasy after shopping at the nearby grocery store . so stopped in just for her to rest , but the manager seemed to notice she was feeling and uneasy and offered to make her something that will make her feel better . he made
3 always the pinot noir , always the 9 iron sandwich . however , i only go when the wine is $ 5 per glass , because i am such a value person . unless it is monday or tuesday , then i go with the $ 20 bottle and bruscetta
3 setting is beautiful ! food has been great before , but this time around it was fair . i hold expensive places to a higher standard . i was n't that excited to come back this last time around .
4 blue nile has great raw food . this is important , , because there are n't too many places available to get raw food now . although it is bit pricey , having raw food available is important , due to the role the <unk> plays in the human body
4 everything an <unk> experience should be !!! meaning a rare blend of exotic and common herbs and spices , mixed in <unk> combinations which made my palate believe i was tasting completely new flavors . menu is a tapas portions of japanese fusion -lrb- tapas is a spanish word for
1 i give them credit for trying , but its just too overpriced for what it is . my tots were cold in the middle , the waitress could n't give a <unk> description of the dish she served me . do n't try to order water to drink because the
3 first i love their chips and salsa , they have just enough heat to <unk> a delicious margarita . we then usually try the mexican pizza or the pork <unk> . the rest of their menus is great too , we just come for happy hour typically .
3 great breakfast burritos and salads . the smoothies are hit n miss , but once you find one you like you 're good . needs free wifi for the wait times .
0 really come on people , i had a thin dry ass over cooked bland hamburger and some undercooked cold fries . nasty . i wo n't be going back . price was right taste was wrong . the biker atmosphere and poorly prepared burgers will make sure i wont be
2 nice staff , cool atmosphere , great drinks , , an the jerk chicken was pretty darn good . . if you like drinks try the mai tai
3 as i do n't live at all in the area , i 've only been here for lunch . a few times with a friend who is quite the regular there , and a few times with a friend of mine who puts out that vibe that practically <unk> she
3 while to some folks its less `` authentic '' vibe is a problem , to me it 's perfect . i have taken several folks here , who are not originally from arizona and had never liked mexican food , and they leave here liking mexican food . to a
3 not bad , not bad at all . as a burrito it 's absolutely huge and even if you could , you should n't eat the whole thing . i am a big fan of getting it as a bowl so i can actually take smaller bites with a fork
4 wow this place is good ! so good ! and not just yummy good , but <unk> good . check out their amazing list of environmentally responsible business practices - <unk> ! that , and it 's cute . and it tastes yummy ! and they are so nice !
4 i finally made it to the top . i live 10-15 min away and appreciate it from here , have referred other folks to check it out , but have never even driven up there until today . so beautiful ! it only takes one or two turns to feel
4 this was my neighborhood restaurant . i 've eaten here more than i care to remember . their pollo fundito is permanently a part of my hips , unfortunately . i love sitting in their back room near the little waterfall , but the big room is fun too -
4 i 've never wanted a camera phone more than when waiting in the <unk> long line for lunch at ted 's hot dogs . because no one would believe me that i was waiting in a line like this for hot dogs when there was no baseball game in the
1 y ' all are officially on notice . why ? it was based on these reviews that i decided to try the place . i was totally prepared to wait when we arrived because we got there at about 7:15 on a friday night . they said 30 min wait
2 so , yea . kelly 's review has me more than a little concerned . thinking we wo n't go back for awhile . most likely quite awhile . i 'd rather be sure they have that crap taken care of . literally . but here 's why we 'll
2 the food is good , but my favorite thing about the place is the art . i know i 'm weird , but they really do have some great pieces to peruse as you nibble those chips and salsa . while this is n't my # 1 mexican spot ,
4 amsterdam is an amazing gay club . it 's gone through several <unk> , and yet still has kept it 's original spirit through it all - which is a welcome change as most clubs think they have to completely <unk> and maybe <unk> whenever they remodel ! but anyhow
3 sometimes i feel like i went to a different place than everyone else . i 've been there a few times and there was never live music , i 've never eaten their food - or been offered a menu so i did n't even know they had food until
1 <unk> ... that was the feeling i left with . i have been wanting to go here for awhile . we finally made it in the other no \ <unk> for a cocktail . the decor is dark and romantic . they have movies in spanish <unk> on a big
1 went for happy hour which is from 4-6pm . you get 1/2 off everything with a `` smiley '' face next to it . i ordered the berry white martini . it is a blueberry martini , very similar to the <unk> blue at pearl , pretty good . it
4 i love this place !! the <unk> blue martini is fantastic !! the happy hour can not be beat . it is 50 % off everything from <unk> 40 % from <unk> and 30 % from <unk> . the <unk> is great . i always sit at the bar ,
2 mexico city mexican food ... ok ... we were warmly greeted and seated immediately . the interior is much nicer then i expected it to be . we sat in a booth and they brought out the chips quickly . they have three sauces that accompany the chips . one
0 i was craving hummus for lunch . i was shopping at the mall and wanted something close ... big fat it is . we sat down and ordered our water and tea . my dining partner wanted to see a wine list , so the waitress brought it over .
3 i called ahead and ordered chicken <unk> thai for take out . i walked in and they immediately knew who i was and what i had ordered -lrb- i guess wearing my name tag helped -rrb- , but it was a wonderful personal touch . the staff here is so
2 i used to have an office right down the street from here , and used to go there to hide out often . i just recently ended up back in gilligan 's for happy hour . the beer , wine and wells are $ 1.00 !!! ca n't beat that
3 this place is so much better than bookmans !! everyone was very friendly and the place was clean . i found all of the books i was looking for . they just changed their policy for trade in . they will only give you store credit , no cash .
4 i really like this place ... taking the advice of yelp we stopped in on our way through downtown . we were immediately greeted as we walked in . i told the staff it was our first time in and asked which sandwich was the best . following the recommendation
4 just went last night ... great ! we sat at the sushi bar where you can watch the guys <unk> ' n ' <unk> ' . i ordered the udon noodles and chicken . so good . just the right amount of spice , but not too hot that it
2 lol @ andrea k. . . fun dirty place for sure , which is what makes it fun ! ! ping pong tables are sweet dude ! <unk> ! just actually came home from that area and we stopped there for a bit ... was cool when the ` dj
3 there is n't a sign out front at all but they must not need it because it 's pretty busy . we only know about it because my husband found it looking up restaurants online . there are no places whatsoever to sit and wait after you first get there
4 order the huge cookie thing that has melted chocolate and ice cream in it . amazing ! i think it used to be called pazookie but they do n't advertise it now apparently .
2 pretty <unk> , food-wise . i do n't think you 'll be disappointed if you 're looking for standard italian fare , but it 's the kind of stuff you can make yourself pretty easily at home . we kinda <unk> out here , as we bought the $ 20
4 just wanted to reiterate my enthusiasm for this place , especially after going and seeing that they have expanded to include donuts . big deal , right ? well , turns out they make them in coconut oil ! that 's highly impressive to me , given the fact every
3 this is the real deal . in saying that , i <unk> other `` japanese '' restaurants , whether some sort of fusion or <unk> or not . this is n't any yuppie 's vision of japanese cuisine located in a cookie-cutter strip mall next to a rubio 's fresh
2 certainly not terrible , but file under `` could use work . '' that said , i really think they should have <unk> the opening till they had more exhibits . that 's the biggest problem with this place ; most exhibits are incomplete or `` coming soon . ''
3 - pretty good pizza . - i think i paid just under $ 3 for a single slice of cheese pizza ? - cool decor . - smell draws you in from the street . - cashier was friendly -lrb- and kept looking at the `` tip '' cup next
2 - consistant food . - good service . - not too long of a wait . - parking was convenient . - updated decor . - area is questionable .
3 - food : huge portions , very tasty , delicious , & fresh ! good prices . - tortas come with either a side <unk> or <unk> potato chips . - a small accompaniment of red and green salsa ... muy <unk> ! - service was friendly , but slow
4 amazing , plain and simple . i do n't quite have the experience that my girlfriend does when it comes to pho -lrb- she grew up back east -rrb- , but this place has the best pho that i have tasted . i took my girlfriend here to try it
3 i love this place . while i do not crave sushi as much as some -lrb- my girlfriend -rrb- , when we are in the mood for it we head here . there are great deals during happy hour and they have a great selection to choose from . it
4 this place is great ! my girlfriend and i came here for the first time to check it out since we had a gift card . we came in later on a friday and were seated right away . our server , bri , was awesome and very attentive .
4 i never thought i 'd find french in the desert . boy was i wrong . my family visited here and my brother stumbled upon this yelp review as we were looking for nice restaurants to try out . we came on a friday night and parked on the street
4 i 'm a little bit of a hippie at heart so i probably am biased when i say that i love this place and it 's likely my favorite spot in arcadia . a microbrewery with delicious food , a huge outdoor patio that 's dog-friendly , <unk> and helpful
3 this is pretty clear cut . super quick , cheap , and above all , clean . i 've only brought shirts and pants here , but every time they come out clean and well <unk> . only downside is that they do n't take credit - only debit or
4 oh my god ... i used to hate chipotle . hate ! hate . when asked why , i said , `` because they offer rice burritos to vegetarians . '' i thought the burritos were 90 percent rice , 10 percent goodness , even when i asked for light
4 every tuesday night after our late night hockey games , i join a rag tag collection of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> at four peaks brewery in north scottsdale for some post game <unk> and nosh . i love these nights . we test our aging , yet surprisingly <unk>
1 i want to like fate but i just do n't . they cater to my vegan cravings so how bad can it be ? but i just get a really shitty vibe when i walk in ... like it 's sooo annoying that i want to eat there . this
3 sometimes , i want to spend a lot on a drink . sometimes , i just want to stare at pretty people and people who are almost pretty but their parents looked too much alike . sometimes , i just want to feel like i do n't belong without standing
3 sexy . sultry . dark . <unk> . cougars . money . athletes . location . leather . cherry . see . seen . smooth . drink . drunk . dui . stiff . staff . longing . <unk> . <unk> . drug . <unk> . lust . subtle .
4 this is the first day of my life i swear i was born right in the doorway -lrb- side door not front entrance -rrb- i went out in the rain suddenly everything changed they 're making burritos within my reach yours is the first face that i saw i think
1 this restaurant seems to have a split personality . when they are good , they are very , very good . friendly service and well-prepared breakfasts -lrb- the eggs benedict and the breakfast fried chicken were two favorites -rrb- . however , after nearly half of the times i have
3 costco ! i can get discounted gas , a rotisserie chicken , huge bricks of cheese and mountains of paper towels all in one place . not to mention meat , and dog treats , and , and , and ... i recently visited this location after work , and
4 i am proud to say that i have hiked the echo canyon side of camelback a few times now , and have not died -lrb- yet -rrb- ... surprisingly , it does get a wee bit easier each time . at least this is what i tell myself . the
4 pho . i 've missed it since moving to arizona . tragic , i know . recently i became <unk> on it . had to have it . for a week it was pretty much the only meal i could think about . where , oh where to get it
3 i really like southwest airlines . while not fancy , they do exactly what they are supposed to do - get you where you are going safely and efficiently - with your <unk> ! - great customer service as well as friendly staff and crew - inexpensive flights with frequent
1 this is a strange little complex of stores that calls itself an outlet mall . with the exception of a newer section <unk> on one end that houses banana republic , gap and j. crew , it seems a bit shabby and outdated . the other <unk> stores were just
3 ice cream cookie . three words that are near and dear to my heart . what makes this delectable treat from churn so special ? they are made to order , and you can create your own combination from their assortment of ice cream and cookie flavors -lrb- made fresh
4 is it ? can it be ? a vietnamese spot i like better than da vang ? yes ... since my vietnamese food loving friend introduced me to pho thanh a few weeks ago -lrb- thank you !! -rrb- , i have already enjoyed multiple visits . it is that
3 the half marathon in 2012 was my first ever , and i enjoyed it so much i returned in 2013 . while the course is not the most scenic -lrb- basically running through tempe and scottsdale -rrb- , the enthusiasm from the bands , djs and volunteers make the route
4 our party of four -lrb- with four different entrees -rrb- give alexi 's twenty -lrb- 20 -rrb- stars ! rack of lamb , veal chop , pasta , and chicken all great and despite a large private party and a <unk> served impeccably . these people know how to run
3 anything but tex-mex ! great mexican dishes served as you never had them , with great <unk> . great food served in a marvelous decor , hardly old mexico . should not even be called a cantina .
3 great salad , great pizza , excellent brews , and good service . we 'll be back .
3 surprising good food by a restuarant one would expect to highlight view and little else . great veal chop and excellent service .
4 the best kept secret treasure in arizona . calamari as in italy , veal to die for , pasta fresh and wonderful , grocery baked bread out of this world . what an awesome new year 's eve !
3 wonderful ambiance , outstanding food , and superior service . a true winner ! we 'll be back for more for sure !
3 four peaks in tempe offers a wide selection of well above average bar food and absolutely great beer in a historically unique and lively environment . please note that lively means lively , this bar is situated near asu so you can expect the usual college crowd of students living
3 let your nose lead the way ... this is one of the few restaurants that can draw you in by <unk> senses alone , thanks to a giant outside rotisserie that seems to excite your senses and it only gets better . the food is simply wonderful , i recommend
2 the arizona science center offers a series of programs called adult 's night out which are held the first friday of every month . these <unk> cover focused <unk> on <unk> ranging from <unk> and <unk> to native american <unk> <unk> of native plants found in the southwest . there
1 earlier this week , we used our handy google mobile app to locate what we hoped was authentic mexican food . we were craving flavorful salsa and <unk> meat dishes after a long , warm day in the desert . what we found here was slightly different than we were
3 okay , you know what 's cute ? a group of <unk> teens dressed in soda counter <unk> and serving all-american treats to <unk> tourists and locals alike ... that 's cute ! this place has a bit of that `` <unk> '' feel with the soda fountain options that
3 i think there is a lot of love going on behind that counter ! this is the real deal , a great group of people who got together and decided that love should taste like bbq ! we found a bogo coupon in the phx entertainment book and decided to
0 go to <unk> on indian school !!!!!!!! its been 3 or 4 weeks since i last washed my car , so i took it to danny 's yesterday because the location was more convenient than <unk> - trader joes was on my to-do list . i had little mud <unk>
4 probably the best pizza place in town . not a <unk> kind of place , but more pizza for <unk> . great location , wonderful ambiance , extensive -lrb- and affordable -rrb- wine list , good salads , and excellent pizza . and the <unk> mi su is awesome .
2 hanny 's has potential - <unk> is one of my favorite places in town . the building , design , and decor at hanny 's are amazing . the menu and service , not so much . i 'm pretty sure it was our waiter 's first night serving tables
4 i love the simplicity here , the dcor , the menu , the staff - clean cut and to the point . i come here with a wine drinker so i usually get wine too . i think they have a great selection of reasonably priced wines that are also
1 there 's a reason i avoided this venue for so long - because i did n't want to be pushed up against a bunch of sweaty people . but the right occasion and the right band pulled me from my comfort zone and into the marquee theatre . i 'm
3 i come for the books ! last time i was here there was a large display of the secret books . it made me wonder if all the people that sold these books to bookmans had ever discovered the secret . i love walking up and down the isles of
3 the service was great we were greeted with a friendly smile and our server was quick and attentive . we shared a caprese salad and pizza . the caprese was good and hit the spot . the pizza was good too . i liked the crunchy crust but it was
3 these meals are so huge . i come here for lunch but the menu items i want are too big to eat for a lunchtime meal . i usually just settle on a salad which are very delicious and tasty but they are completely devoid of any of the healthy
4 drop what you 're doing and drive here . after i ate here i had to go back the next day for more . the food is that good . this cute little green building may have gone <unk> <unk> if i had n't been driving down palm rd to
3 they have a really great brunch on the weekends ! i had some crab stuffed crepes that the bartender recommended and they were better than i could have hoped for - yum ! i also tried a few signature cocktails and they were just as good . it 's nice
4 the first time i stayed here was in 2004 - about two years after it opened so everything was still new . i 've stayed here one weekend each summer since then . it 's hard to believe that it 's been 8 years since my first visit but what
3 i 'm teetering between 3 and 4 stars . in fact , i wish we were using star search <unk> because i 'd give 3 and 3 quarters stars . really cool decor . like a retro , train station kinda feel . there were these ginormous <unk> lamp shade
2 lovely restaurant in the borgata , typical trendy decor that the fox restaurants have going for them . my girlfriend and i met up for margs and lunch on a saturday , it was busy but we were able to get a table right away . our server was slow
2 this is a nice little pub . january is everything you would want out of a bartender - funny , quick to serve up your next beverage and easy on the eyes . i had the sunup ipa , pretty tasty . to eat i ordered the sonoran chicken salad
3 a friend of mine had hyped this place up for the past week and so i was definitely excited to take it for a test drive . when we arrived , it was during lunch hours and the place was pretty busy , but we walked right up to the
3 went here for a company party a while back , so we had a private room and were limited to certain items set up <unk> , so that 's probably part of the reason i can only give it four stars at this time . cheese crisp was ok ,
0 hate this place so much . it must be an employment requirement for any male -lrb- bartenders and bouncers -rrb- to be <unk> d-bags who spend more time <unk> and hitting on chicks than actually doing a <unk> job . the space itself sucks , there are always people just
2 so we met a girl from peru , she took us here after 10pm when it turns into a salsa bar ! they turn the lights down low , play the music a little too loud , keep the full bar open , have latin american music videos <unk> on
4 so um we really , really wanted some swedish meatballs one day . then low and behold we landed at beaver choice . best . accident . ever . this is a family owned business . we were the only guests . the <unk> son <unk> on us . we

4 going to little woody is like having an exciting secret affair ? you do n't want everyone to know about it , but it 's so much fun you do n't want to deny yourself of the pleasure ! the little woody its a hole in the wall , little
2 with an identity change this restaurant is all location , architecture & super stylish sexy ambiance ! after 23 + years ' great <unk> service to the city of phoenix houston 's moved across the street to their own new stand alone building . -lrb- who figured out your parking
3 the cool thing about they rhythm room is the variety of people there . almost every time i go , there 's a girl on the dance floor ... on roller skates ! then there will be a few <unk> , rockabilly , country , of all ages . that

4 when my boss orders us <unk> lunch , he always gets spinato 's ! i 'm more excited about having it than i am having him pay for it ! i love the square pieces and thin crust . and , yes , there is just something about the sauce
3 when i see a burger on the menu with bleu cheese , i pretty much cream myself . -lrb- that 's a great detail if you want to take me out on a date , boys . -rrb- the service was spot-on and we never had to ask for a

4 my absolute favorite thai restaurant in the valley ! i just happened upon this place over 4 years ago . though the decor was a bit cheesy , it has improved over the years . the service ca n't be beat ! as soon as my drink is almost empty
1 i would much rather have tried the downtown location , but , lo , i was dating a guy from gilbert . that lasted 2 weeks . the date , not the food . good enough , i guess . i had some sandwich but it was n't very memorable
4 omg ! the best french fries in town ! real , <unk> fries with the skin still on . the perfect crispness and <unk> ! their burgers are to die for . freshly cooked , pure beef . the place has been around for <unk> years . it 's had
4 harley 's is my staple for a chill meal . i enjoy coming here by myself , especially after a hectic day . well , i had had a <unk> week and after going to the <unk> party tonight , with no dinner in my gut , i headed to
1 i started a new job and the bosses brought us here for lunch . it was ok . i got a lunch combo meal , but i did n't pay . the service was really great but the food was not . just kind of plain . it 's convenient
3 it 's dangerous that i live so close to this place ! i can walk there . which i should , since it 's ice cream and i need to work some of it off . get the peanut butter with a scoop of chocolate . they have candy ,
2 i have been on a quest to find the best fish n chips in cenpho . i had heard they had a tuesday fish fry at maizie 's and really love the place , so i had to give it a try . four smallish pieces of fish , a

4 mido sushi ! i ca n't believe i have n't already written a review about my favorite `` discounted and very affordable `` sushi place . where else can you go during happy hour -lrb- which is pretty much all day until 7 pm -rrb- and get a california roll
4 love this place ! it 's always fun eating at joe 's . we celebrated my bestie 's birthday at joe 's on baseline last sunday . jesse was our server . he was excellent and very attentive ! the wait staff make it fun by doing periodic line dances
3 i 'm not much of a baseball fan , but i do love people watching and soaking up rays . so i went to a spring training game at salt river fields anticipating a nice day of doing exactly that . we had lawn tickets , but who knew it
3 i went looking for frozen bags of edamame and sweet rice , coconut milk and ripe mango to make a sticky rice dessert . i found everything at super l ranch market . i 'll be back !
3 i stopped in here with the owner 's girlfriend after she cut my hair . she kindly treated me to anything i wanted to eat and drink . <unk> hoo ! i ordered a grey goose and cranberry and a las vegas roll -lrb- my all time favorite sushi -
3 moved to scottsdale yesterday . while our furniture is set to arrive next week , we decided to stay at valley ho for a few nights . did n't want to go far from the hotel since we were super tired , having just driven down from san francisco .

2 bikini gets a 5 some nights and a 1 some nights . over the past 3.5 years of the <unk> explosion , i 've been the sad witness to bikini becoming a trendy dive bar instead of an actual dive bar . some nights , this is still the hangout
3 this place ca n't be beat in the downtown area in terms of creative , yummy food , relaxed atmosphere , and fair prices . i 've sampled about half of the menu , and while the red curried noodles and veggies was n't really spicy enough for me ,
3 yummy , creative sandwiches ! good prices . highly recommended . service is generally a bit of an issue , so if you are one of the <unk> eaters who does n't understand that serving can be tough , you 'll probably get your <unk> in a wad .
3 <unk> coffee . lux taught me the difference between good coffee and great coffee , and for this i am <unk> grateful . this is definitely the best coffeeshop amongst the many that <unk> downtown to get some solo work done . the furniture is n't really set up in
4 the bean and cheese chimichanga will destroy your universe and <unk> it as a place that is a stranger to suffering and pain , a beautiful world of <unk> and <unk> . worth waiting in line .
3 delicious barbeque served with <unk> . the best greens and mac and cheese i 've had since moving to phoenix ! the pies are also wonderful . i 'm a vegetarian , so i stick to the sides , but my friends really enjoy the meat here .
4 this is the wedding of a smart owner and some great cooks in the kitchen . first off , they have a small -- probably 8 tables at most and that 's counting several 2 person tiny tables -- cafe <unk> in an alley . we had a little problem
0 edible but certainly not good . do people who eat their pizza have no clue what great pizza is ?
3 had 2 free tickets as this was the locals night doing comedy , so they do n't get paid and you do n't get charged ; however , we had 4 stella artois beers and the tab came to $ 29 + -lrb- includes gratuity -rrb- , so those beers
3 on a recent trip to az , i came to this slices for the first time in years after going to the bars on mill for the first time in years . when i was younger i made the usual late night drunken stops here , but my family even
2 most of the reviews for this place seem to be short and sweet , and i can definitely see why . when i lived in scottsdale i would occasionally stop here when <unk> through old town for a drink or two . nothing is really memorable about the place .
3 i 've been here a few times for happy hour so that 's all i have to go by . honestly , i probably would n't be giving this place 4 stars if i had come during a non hh time . the food is n't really that great ,
3 i know the breakfast club has been here since at least a year or two before i moved from az -lrb- which was a little over 3 years ago -rrb- and i never tried it until this past week when i was in town for the holidays . i can
2 if you go to the olive garden expecting to get an awesome italian meal , you 're gon na be very disappointed . if you go with low expectations -lrb- as weird as that might sound -rrb- it 's really not that bad . even though my parents can eat
3 me & the fam gave this place a try when i was home for a visit and really liked it ! the food here is a solid . my mom , sister , & i each each had the half sandwich <unk> salad or soup option . at $ 7.95
2 i 'm <unk> between 2 and 3 stars . 2 is `` meh . i 've experienced better , '' which is completely true in terms of service and <unk> . 3 is `` a-ok '' which is how i felt about the food . to be honest , i
3 so we wandered into pita house on a sunday afternoon . it 's small and unassuming . it plays techno middle eastern music , shows <unk> pride commercials on their one tv and the walls are painted to look like they 're cracked stone and like you 're in someone
1 this mall gives me the <unk> <unk> . weird , desolate <unk> stores , way too many kiosks with uncomfortable <unk> approaching you , dirty -lrb- dirty -rrb- bathrooms , dingy and dim ... done .
4 if this place becomes too big of a deal and i have to start waiting a long time i 'm going to ... well , i 'm going to not be happy . tiny <unk> olive dishes ! <unk> 'd menus ! a pizza oven that 's right there !
3 love love love their spicy tuna ! call in your order for quicker service
3 love love loved their wines ! my veggie sandwich on focaccia was delicious ! the side salad made me wish i had ordered the chips instead . definitely going back .
3 $ 22 a month for unlimited washes , vacuum use and air <unk> just ca n't be beat . and if you smile back at the friendly staff , they usually throw in an extra air <unk> .
3 best shrimp fried rice i have eaten in a while !
3 i had an entertainment book coupon for a buy 1 get 1 free pizza . score ! i ordered a 16 '' veggie & a 16 '' <unk> supreme all for $ 23 . the slices were huge ! the veggies were fresh ! and everything else was just delicious

1 i purposely did n't read the yelp reviews before coming here so that i would n't have any preconceived notions about this place . i wanted to check this place out with fresh eyes . some of my points here have been shared many times over in previous reviews but
3 been here for a variety of events and always enjoyed this venue . i wish the ladies room was a little more accessible but beyond that , the seats are comfy , the stage is easy to view no matter where you sit , and the people who work here
4 we hit up pita jungle before we headed to gammage for a play last night and although it 's not our first time to pita jungle , it was our first time to this pita jungle . the 5 stars is based on the awesome service experience we had .
3 fun , friendly , prompt service and tasty food ? what 's not to like ? portions here are definitely <unk> so you are not going to go away hungry . they were very accommodating to our large party and our server was excellent . parking here is horrible though
3 went with a party of 10 this past weekend for my best friend 's birthday extravaganza . we had teppanyaki and our chef was terrific . he was very funny , inviting , and did a great job with everyone 's food . we had a range of dishes from

4 very festive dcor with all kinds of little mermaid paintings and colorful <unk> . chips are light and fresh and came with two salsas , a red and a green salsa . fast , friendly and attentive service . had the recommended crab enchiladas in a red sauce . delicious
3 when i want to feel like i am eating really healthy or pretending to be a vegetarian for a meal , i love pita jungle . but the whole truth is there is no where i have found in az or sd that has better falafel than pita jungle .
3 maybe it is because i am new to dim sum and i have only tried 2 different places ... but everytime i go to china king i leave very satisfied and looking forward to go back again . i go with my friends who usually do the ordering and we

3 hmm indian food sounds good tonight , well i am in luck , indian paradise is but a mere hop skip & a jump jump , so off we go . ordered vegetable <unk> 's , <unk> josh and <unk> kofta curry . both were lamb dishes and both were
4 i really really really enjoy humble pie . tried every pizza on the menu and the only one that i did n't like was the little neck clam , but that 's just personal preference ... the pistachio is a ` dry ' pizza , different but good ! and
3 freddy 's lived up to the hype - bravo ! loved the inside 50s style diner setup - very nostalgic -lrb- can i say that when i was n't alive in the 50s though ? : -rrb- -rrb- a car show was going on outside , which was kinda neat
2 a friend and i had the special burger at liberty market . the place inside is gorgeous and clean , and set up like a bistro . i did n't get the impression that this was a restaurant that perhaps the way olive garden is setup , yet the prices
3 2nd time i 've eaten here , was just as impressed as the first . the restaurant is absolutely gorgeous with a <unk> ambiance appropriate for families and groups . i took 11 friends from a movie we had seen over to the restaurant tonight . the food was incredible
4 i 'm not a big chain restaurant type of gal , but this place is top notch not only in service , but as well as quality of food . the fillet <unk> was tasty , perfectly cooked -lrb- medium -rrb- , and still sizzling hot on my plate .
4 the closest thing to mama 's home cooking and if you know how good my mama cooks ... well , the woman can cook ! their ceviche is big with fresh seafood . the <unk> <unk> comes in a big plate and worth every bite . the only thing i
4 i crave the mission daily ! i have been quite a regular of this unique latin american restaurant and can not wait to go back and experience more dishes . i enjoy starting with the cheese plate . let me tell you , this is no ordinary cheese plate .
3 this place is pretty cool ! if it were n't for the server who started out awesome and ended up rude , i would give it five stars . i guess three middle-aged patrons were n't nearly as interesting as a table full of girls ' night <unk> . once
0 we visited again . open mic night is actually sunday , not monday . this time we ordered food . i had a philly ; it was unremarkable , but it was edible . the beer was still good . unfortunately , the patronage left much to be desired .
3 this is only for the bar . i have been here twice now while visiting , and service is superb . the bottled beer list has some unique options ; if they had a couple of these on tap , i would give five stars . in talking to joe
4 this is by far my favorite pizza restaurant . we have never once had a bad experience here , and the food is always amazing . they do have a full bar , with a tv in that area . the outdoor seating is very nice and overlooks a <unk>
2 great prices for pretty much anything you need . i just hate how long it takes to check out on weekends . the other thing <unk> directly to costco is how stupid the people in the parking lot are . also if you want to avoid your car being door
4 this is my kind of restaurant . very simple menu of things you would eat off the grill . burgers , hot dogs , brats all cooked over a charcoal grill . there was a bit of a wait in line , but the price and taste of the food
3 i actually stumbled upon this place when i was on my diet and i have been a fan since . i love that it is a local place and it is family owned . not to mention they are chicago cubs fans !!! the food is great and the portions
3 cute ice cream place in central phoenix ! i like that it has the feel of an old ice cream and candy store . the flavors are good and the service is good as well . i wish there was more seating for people that want to chill and enjoy
3 i really do like this place ! my sister made me a fan and i try and go there every morning if i can ! the price is very reasonable and the coffee is good ! i love that they chit chat with you while they are making your drink
3 this place is really good ! the location is perfect and the atmosphere is really urban with a hipster feel to it . we went during the week and it was <unk> but we sat at the pizza bar in front of the kitchen . the guys in the kitchen
2 ok , so here goes the review for ticoz . i am glad to see that the restaurant was busy yesterday ... i mean it looked really packed , which is great for the owners because they are real nice people ! the main issue we had was the server
3 actually wanted to give it a 3.5 ... not quite a 3 but not quite a 4 either . i had the hot and sour soup and the mongolian beef ! the hot and sour soup was one of the best i have ever had ! it had tons of
2 if you live in central phoenix and need chinese food , this is a good place to go . it is a huge restaurant that serves all the normal chinese dishes . i had the <unk> chicken and added broccoli . i could have done without all the scallions and
1 the food at pita jungle is really good but the service at the 2 locations i have been at is always the same , horrible ! i came into this location to have dinner with 3 other people and walked in and asked for a table and the hostess sat
1 stopped in for a quick drink . i wanted tequila , but not a margarita and late-night , there was no drink menu around so i stuck with vodka soda , which ended up being a vodka water sans lime i sucked down before we got out of there !
3 great food , if just slightly overhyped . it 's a cute building in a great location with friendly staff , but does not win my vote for best pizza in phoenix , sorry ! definitely check it out though , it 's top five , but be prepared to
2 while i miss <unk> <unk> 's , this standard , <unk> bar is a decent , low-key , if a little <unk> option at tempe marketplace . the crowd leans a little older than cadillac , san <unk> 's or d & b . i just went to catch up
3 i ca n't stop talking about the fried chicken at chelsea 's . it is sooooo good . we went here on saturday night with a group of friends , and we had a great time . we sat at one of the large tables on the front porch ,
4 the ultimate in relaxation . one of my friends in tampa purchased a gift certificate for me at this lovely spa . it does n't look like much from the outside , but trust me , when you step inside ... it is an oasis . the staff at the
3 spinach and parmesean souffle - enough said . we had a very solid meal at elements this past friday night . nothing went wrong whatsoever , but we both just felt that it was missing that something special to earn a 5th star . we were seated promptly , and
4 five stars for <unk> exactly what it sets out to do ... burgers and beers in a laid back environment . if you want to wear your new heels or fancy outfit , do n't come here , but if you just want to throw on jeans , eat a
2 such a fun sports atmosphere ! we had late afternoon appetizers and beer here before a diamondbacks game last week , and it was exactly what we needed . if you can get over the fact that all of the waiters and waitresses have their faces painted -lrb- which is
3 food ? awesome . service ? sufficient . layout ? not the best . we stopped into chompie 's this past friday morning on our way out of town for the long weekend . my husband and i have this obsession with breakfast bagels - in particular , breakfast bagels
4 why oh why have i never been to postino before ?!?!?! this place is awesome . i went on friday with a friend for lunch , and it 's the kind of place that just puts you in a good mood . i love the fact that they offer $
3 i love their chicken curry of all things . caramel dessert is also fantastic .
4 very good food and you could not ask for a more fun environment . we have a lot of mexican food in mesa and this is by far the best ! try the salmon enchiladas or the seafood tacos ... wow ! you also ca n't go wrong with their
4 seriously good food .
0 i hate giving bad reviews but i have been three times now and hated it every time . the pizza has been soggy and the toppings fall off the crust . crust is not good . ordered salad w / pine nuts on it and we got a whole two
4 best ribs and waffles anywhere . fun to sit outside . go here , you will like it for sure !
3 good solid veggie salad .
4 i have had some good digestive experiences here . also , i have <unk> who works here ... so that 's another <unk> for you to step in .
4 little saigon , such a quaint little place in -lsb- usually -rsb- desolate old town glendale . weekends are reasonably busy here , but we came on a thursday ... and were basically the only ones there . is 8pm really that late ??? come on , night <unk> ,
3 lol , with much <unk> <unk> and obligatory freak dance
4 frozen <unk> cheesecake on a stick with artificial strawberry <unk> . see you in october !
4 bean burrito , extra cheese . side of rice . i have dined at someburros for a huge chunk of my life -lrb- 15 years ? -rrb- , and only once have i ordered anything different than that which is listed . they 're exceptionally generous with the cheese when
4 five stars for their new happy hour menu , which they call their `` economic <unk> package . '' 4:00 <unk> pm and 9:00 <unk> : domestic drafts are 75 cents . pitchers ? $ 2.99 . small pitchers are somewhere in between . i 'm really , really easy
2 yes , lifetime fitness is expensive . when i joined , i felt that $ <unk> was a little excessive but appreciated the wealth of amenities i was provided . i eventually canceled in favor of a cheaper rate at la fitness and have learned that lifetime has raised their
3 it 's small , but serviceable . the beer selection is really , really great . it 's actually good enough you forget they do n't have anything on tap . it 's loud inside . this can go either way , but i thought it was fine . everybody
3 the pizza is really good . just make sure you 're on your a game - like other people have said , there are so . many . rules . i 've never caught attitude from an employee , but they 've got me <unk> .
3 lots of superior flavors in all of the dishes that i have had . doesnt matter if you order a pork dish , tacos , soup , whatever , it is all fun to eat . just a delight .
3 with most menus i stick to a few core items , but at windsor it is a great idea to try a lot of new food . the staff does not seem able to miss when it comes to a single menu item . the vibe and decor is superior
3 delicious cheap food . it is a `` <unk> '' place so plan accordingly . the food is remarkably filling as well .
3 i 've been wanting to try cherry blossom 's ramen for a while . since i ca n't get my <unk> fix here in az , cherry blossom will have to do . their ramen hit the spot and would be great on a cold day at home sick ,
3 i accidentally walked into the men 's restroom at mable 's . i hate when that happens . i really need to pay more attention . at least nobody was in there , but it still never feels good walking out of the men 's restroom into a room full
3 my friends and i started off saturday night with drinks and appetizers at bungalow . i love being on the patio before the temperature rises to an uncomfortable degree and bungalow has a big one . it was crowded , but a group was just leaving and we snagged their
3 so , an update with another fun conversation from drift . standing at the bar waiting for my drink , i turn to see some guy smiling at me and tipping his drink in my direction as if to say hello . me : `` what are you drinking ?
3 first , you should know that the four stars i 'm giving this place is based off my one and only visit . second , i went with a purpose , too see a fashion show . third , they had freakin ' <unk> well drinks , thats 25 cents
4 i 've been going here for years and i just love this place . it can get really busy on the weekends , but if you go mid-week for lunch you will find the patio very relaxing . the restaurant looks like it used to be a house . there
4 sadly , i am basically only updating this review because i am obsessed with their turkey sandwich . it 's that good . i do n't need to write anything else . oh wait , yes i do . pretzel bun . pretzel . bun . ok , now this
3 you have n't lived until you 've had your car towed from the nearby apartment complex ... little tip , those signs that say cars will be towed are not empty <unk> . just park on the street like everyone else . then you wo n't end the night making
2 so , i 've been here twice . it 's definitely an older crowd , well older than me anyway and i 'm in my <unk> . that 's not a bad thing , just an observation . i met a woman who told me that if she was my
2 i decided to give this place another shot . this time around i was sober , and thus have actual memories . after grabbing a drink my friend and i decided to head out to the patio . a group of 3 guys graciously let us share their table since
4 i 've always enjoyed z tejas , or should i say i 've always enjoyed the drinks at z tejas ... a while back , i had a few too many drinks and accidentally <unk> this little old lady ... at least she was the only one i caught looking
4 love . love . love . for starters , i can get a green iced tea the size of my head . they have a drive-thru and it 's a healthy drive-thru . not to mention they have the best tuna sandwich i 've ever had . i probably eat
3 does arlecchino have the best gelato in phoenix ? yes , undoubtedly . especially love the chocolate and coffee flavors which are particularly intense . i 'm all for small independent places , but wish that arlecchino would be a bit more generous in the way they treat customers -
3 had lunch here on a weekend when we did n't want to wait for a table at morning glory . this is definitely `` slow '' food so be warned . luckily the outdoor seating was beautiful but a bread basket definitely would 've helped calm our <unk> stomachs .
2 read a few months ago in the chinese papers that <unk> is under new management and acquired a new award-winning dimsum chef , so decided to give it a shot before some major shopping at lee lee . did n't hurt that they were promoting all sizes of dimsum at
4 i agree with the other reviews , yasu serves some of the best japanese food in phoenix . the formula of fresh high quality ingredients , authentic preparation , <unk> presentation , modern yet unpretentious decor , friendly service and reasonable prices is destined for success . having spoiled my
4 dimsum today was unexpectedly good . tried it on a weekday a few months ago and it was so-so but i could tell there was potential . selection on weekends is way better than the weekday . they had my one of my favorites : steamed brown sugar cake -lrb-
3 the most authentic old-time soda shop experience in phoenix . forget about that other place in old town ... a mere <unk> from the 50 's . mac <unk> is the real deal . when you want a malt , this is the place to go with 6 scoops in
3 everything here tasted like fried chicken , which is a good thing if you like fried chicken . the catfish i had also tasted vaguely of chicken ... also mrs white used the same batter for both ... very light and crisp ... though i must admit to preferring the
0 i need to deduct another star for their use of styrofoam cups . green definitely it 's not .
3 sometime it 's not about the food ... when you 're all about hanging out with a couple of good friends and enjoying the <unk> phoenix evening ... then this is where frank & lupe shines we had enchilada , chicken in mole sauce , fish tacos and beef flautas
3 awesome , super authentic chinese soup . gourmet house of hong kong has a daily soup that 's definitely a must try ... but please do keep an open palate . the soup changes to suit the season . . with cooling ingredients in the summer and heating ingredients in
3 fun for the kids , expensive for the parents ,
4 stopped in for margs and appetizers . had 2 house margaritas ... . am i drunk ? holy moly what do they put in those things ? food was great , drinks were better , i 'll be back !
4 stopped in for lunch one afternoon and had a tortilla crusted chicken and spinach salad . hands down the best salad i have ever had , i did nothing short of lick the bowl . where have you been all my life !!! i 'll be back , again and
3 i 've lived in phoenix since 1998 and have heard wonderful things about carolina 's since then , and until today , i had never been . my fiance and i stopped in today for a late lunch -lrb- around 2:30 pm -rrb- and are so happy we did .
0 i 've spending a lot of time with a friend who is a pretty serious coffee drinker . a couple nights ago , we stopped in at hava java for a caffeinated beverage before enjoying some gelato next door . being the afternoon of july 4th , the place was
3 i try to stay away from starbucks whenever i can . for the longest time , the only coffee shop within walking distance from my office was starbucks . no thanks . a few weeks ago , a co-worker told me about a new place that opened at the biltmore
3 i have yet to be truly disappointed after eating at oregano 's . i 've experienced iffy service at the mesa location , but the camelback location has always been great . i 've always had to wait , but that 's only given me the opportunity to enjoy a
4 my first experience with five guys was in dc and at the time , i wished for a location to open in phoenix . wish granted ! my mom and i visited the new place this week and i was not surprised to see it as busy as it was
3 great taco bar , nachos are amazing , fajitas are also excellent ! they have a huge selection of margaritas to choose from that are not the typical fruit . the jalapeno , cucumber , and hibiscus are all worth trying .
3 excellent food all around !! the <unk> was good , salad was interesting , and the pizza was exceptional . my favorite was the rosa pizza with a close second at the bianco pizza . the wait was n't too bad on a thursday night and with the bar next
2 i wish i could give this place a better rating , but we tried to double date here and the first time we walked in we got no service . as we walked in we told the waiter we would like a glass of wine and possibly order food ,
3 i mainly go here for afternoon snacks <unk> my daughters . they have very fairly priced pizza by the slice . do n't be fooled because of the `` <unk> '' vibe this place gives out . i 've compared their prices to bashas and most times aj 's prices
3 i really like lolo 's . they have very good food . i can easily say that everything i 've ever ordered at lolo 's has been delicious . the sweet tea is as advertised . when ordering the kool aid , i usually order it as half water ,
3 you want a slice bigger than your face ? if you answered `` yes . '' then this is the place for you . this is by my daughters ' school , so sometimes we 'll grab a bite there on our way home . the slice is enough for
3 they have a very good selection . when you 're not in the mood for mass produced donuts from those chains , this is the place to go . the donuts always tastes fresh . over the years , we have never encountered a stale donut from bosa yet .
3 my wife and i eat here when we go on a date without the kids . one of my daughters is allergic to peanuts , so a thai restaurant is not an ideal place to take her . we 've eaten at all of the thai restaurants in the east
0 in all seriousness , i have heard good things about this place from several people , i kind of walked in and was trying to think what the hell was the theme here , seriously if <unk> ever went in here they would close this place down , with stuffed
3 i buy my food here because it 's healthy and i do n't want to die from the <unk> flu . and in a more serious note . i love sprouts because they have a large selection and very competitive prices for healthy organic food . great place to observe
4 sprinkles cupcakes ... should aptly be renamed the 3 pound cupcake of frosting heaven ... or something similar along those lines ... so i had to go deliver a package today so i went to the <unk> by sprinkles and said fuck it i will try one of these mysterious
3 coach house is your favorite dive bar ... this bar reminds me of almost every shit hole in the upper <unk> of michigan . a great little spot to throw back a few beers after a rough day . drinks are cheap and the staff is friendly . plenty of
1 pink taco ... the name itself has you asking questions , of is this a restaurant or a <unk> of some sort , when you walk in and see the decor , of the mexican low <unk> bicycle on the wall , and the <unk> , you are still wondering
2 as a fairly new connoisseur of greek food , this place is pretty good . i like their pita a lot , and the fire feta is quite addicting . the salad and rice are n't anything to write home about , and i 'm not crazy about the tzaziki
1 my fiance and i were excited by the menu ... a little on the pricey side , but we do n't mind paying as long as the food is up to par . well , this place did n't quite make the mark . almost thirty bucks for 2 sandwiches
0 my fiance and i are a huge fan of sushi ... i 'd say addicted . after reading so many of the good reviews , we decided to give it a try ... well , yuck is all we have to say ! the sushi was overpriced , the cold
1 i really love this place but tonight not just the salsa but also the hot sauce was sour . maybe it was because of xmas i assume <unk> closed . we asked for the manager and he brought out fresh salsa that was also sour . i cant think of
4 this place is like i designed it as my own restaurant . cool beachy theme . the sweetest servers in scottsdale . not just one server helps you they all make sure you get good service . the food is cool too . burgers with hatch peppers my personal favorite
0 while i have had worse pizza i really disliked my pizza . almost no cheese . the wood fired oven burns parts of the pizza . good if you like extra crispy pizza . i do not . it was more like cardboard . and burning pizza doesnt help keeping
4 i loved this place . great place to be . it just feels like living hanging here . it 's almost better than being in hawaii . everyone was very nice . not just the bartender who gave us great service but also the host and who ever ran our
4 i love la condesa . what more do i need to say ? the salsa bar is amazing ! i really like their carne asada . they do but beans in the burrito , which , at first i was n't sure how i 'd feel about it , but
3 i dig maizie 's . it 's a great little place just south of camelback on central . the staff is <unk> and courteous , the food is great , and the atmosphere is awesome ! we 've been there a handful of times now and i have n't yet
4 dive bar heaven ? maybe . the night we went the jukebox was n't on but they were playing some groovy 80 's tunes . there 's a pool table in the front room where you walk in . the roof lines are great mid century modern goodness . i
1 boyfriend and i came here on whim ... just saw it had some decent reviews on yelp . we chose to check out the bar area to see if we could grab a seat , since it was our 1st time we realized there were tables as well as a
4 this place is fabulous . truely a gem , in our neighborhood .
0 disappointing is an understatement .
3 only been once so more of a full review will follow . i was waiting for a movie and got an espresso because i 'm c & c , yeah that 's right , <unk> and classy . coffee was very good , menu looked great as did the actual
4 it was silly to only give this legendary place 4 stars , i stand corrected by myself
4 what can i say about trader joes that hasnt been said before , its great and this review is more so for all trader joes of the world that equally rock faces . and by rock faces i dont mean that in the ufc way where you will get <unk>
3 aside from the fact that rebecca n. is into mike the bartender which i do n't have any background on other than the review this place is delicious and to be honest the best burger ive had in a long time . i love deluxe and also places like stax
3 went on a sunday at yelp 's recommendation and was pleased with the food , but my overall experience was n't great . the douche who took my order told me ten minutes and when i arrived exactly ten minutes later , he says , `` that was fast !
4 this gem has everything an italian or anyone with good taste could desire ! . . and they appear to be family-owned and offer excellent customer service ! i had the italian sausage and peppers sandwich on italian bread and they told me it was an excellent choice ... no
4 my favorite burger joint in az . i do n't throw that statement around , so try it for yourself . the burger is cooked fresh , not frozen , over an open flame . the onion rings are fresh and you can truly make it your way at the
4 even for meat eaters , green has a lot to love . a lot more than just tofu ! i go here at least a couple times a month for lunch and it 's spectacular 95 % of the time . a few of our favorite items are the bbq
3 i 'm going to go out on a limb and say outside my dinky <unk> kitchen , cheba hut offers the best subs in the area . one would think , `` oh cheba hut is all about the ambiance . you are paying for the experience , not the
1 not vegan/vegetarian friendly at all . the beans have bacon in them . the server was able to hook it up with some veggie fajitas , off the menu , but still not exactly the kind of thing i would really want to pay money for . felt a bit
1 wow . how the might have fallen ... asleep . the menu is as big as <unk> factory . the servers indifferent . <unk> . went there for the first time in a long time . just seemed `` the same '' or `` tired '' . question : who
0 `` fool me once , shame on you . fool me twice , shame on me '' . -lrb- just because george w. bush could n't get the saying right , does n't mean i ca n't . -rrb- a few months ago , i yelped about the poor service
0 yeah , my previous posts are accurate : these guys and gals are very inconsistent . never the same amount of heat . never ! these guys are either very savvy or they just hate me . either way , i 'm not going back and that 's a shame
0 apparently , silverware is to much to ask for . by the time she had any interest in my experience my food was cold . i sent it back , and was assured a ` new ' one was being prepared . when the same plate <unk> the plate was
4 hodori is set in an all asian strip mall , with 2 or 3 other restaurants . that being said , it was the only one packed on a tuesday night . i ordered the kimchi fried rice , being my first time there , i did n't want to
2 i never get chips , or fries . usually just a drink . this place makes me get the amazing sweet potato fries with olive oil and rosemary . . their burgers come second to lobby 's , though , and the service at this location is shitty at best
0 this place just keeps going down , and their prices keep coming up . their sushi used to be good . the rolls were obviously from another day , or frozen , or something . bad bad , my drink did n't come until after my second helping of cold
4 i am so glad i found this place ! by far ... this is the best dim sum place i have found . the place has tight <unk> , but i do n't care ... i 'm about the food ! i love love love dim sum !!! i need

3 omg !!! this place is amazing ! it was my first time here and i just loved the food . it is a little pricey , but not too bad for what you get . my coworkers and i started off with the salmon and artichoke . i tried artichoke
3 glad to say this place is still going strong a little over a year after my first <unk> . wan na try it ? then visit on a tuesday night for $ 1 tacos and $ 2 <unk> ! they have amazingly good tacos and salsa , and an excellent
4 fantastic place for lunch - the food here is <unk> -lrb- a lot of it is local too -rrb- . the menu is fun and original . i loved the fried edamame -lrb- rice oil -rrb- . the turkey wrap had a pile of fresh roasted turkey which was tender
3 saddle ranch is a welcome addition to old town . this place has been consistently busy since it opened recently . i have yet to dine here , but late at night it is fun to get plowed while watching people get tossed off the mechanical bull . it has
4 deserving of the many accolades it has gotten here on yelp . this is a very very classy place to dine and the service is impeccable . the steaks and seafood are absolute top shelf .
3 good place . i have been coming here for years . it 's even better now that they expanded and purchased the coffee shop next door -lrb- which is now the pita house bar -rrb- . the food is good , the patio and new bar are are set-up well
3 when i first discovered lux i was blown away by the caliber of their coffee , and the really cool building they are located in . what blew my coffee buzz was the staff informed me that the owner wanted nothing to do with free wifi because `` he did
4 never before in my life have i tasted breakfast this good . the place is small -lrb- very small -rrb- , expect to wait around an hour on the weekends . once you get in here try the `` hog and chick '' , i suggest you get the hash
3 not quite the charm of the tempe location , though a nice place all the same . the staff are a little too `` hip '' for their own good but friendly and talented for the most part . the food is why we came and we did not leave
3 nice little family run spot . i really like their cold italian combo sub . staff are helpful and friendly . not much atmosphere though , an inexpensive update could really improve sit down business .
3 this is an upscale outdoor shopping experience with restaurants , bars and movie theaters . its directly across the street from kierland commons . between the scottsdale quarter , kierland and the <unk> -lrb- all walkable -rrb- you can easily blow through your <unk> <unk> .
2 great place to see a band play - the stage is large , they offer great seating options , a cute little dance area , and the sound system rocks . i would n't come here just for dinner and drinks .
3 about as good as a mall food court is going to get . almost as good as a stand alone pita jungle location . great gyro 's and hummus . plus , really fast service .
3 great place to grab a burger and a custom brew ... you got ta try the peach beer . the beer flights are fun too . plus , you can take home a `` growler '' -lrb- big <unk> -rrb- of your favorite beverage .
3 this is an inexpensive option for our weekly shopping . i appreciate their dedication to using quality products and <unk> produce - though i usually stop by f & e after work for their <unk> meals that take just seconds to prepare after i get home .
3 if you like sports and you like steaks ... then you have just found heaven . this is a scottsdale landmark , and something of a sporting museum unto itself . the restaurant has a dark , classy , old-school feel . the food is wonderful , one of the
3 good food , great atmosphere ... this place is entirely underground , all you 'll see when you drive up is a little <unk> building . the seafood is only fresh and well prepared . drinks are well poured -lrb- strong -rrb- . i hear happy hour here is a

3 `` fantastic german food '' is what i have heard from every person i know who 's ever been here . i agree . every plate i tried was impressive . they also have some great rare german beers .
4 this is a wonderful place to relax with friends . the atmosphere inside is dark and eclectic -lrb- definitely a locally owned , <unk> establishment -rrb- . top notch brick oven pizza , super cheese plates , and a great wine selection -lrb- though only two italian beers -rrb- .
4 i am far from a french food expert but i had a great experience here . the staff are over the top friendly and accommodating . i love the cozy atmosphere inside and on the patio . they have an interesting cocktail menu and a choice selection of french wine
3 this is a locally owned breakfast spot run by people that obviously care . i tried the <unk> corned beef hash , and i 'm excited to go back and sample more of their unique dishes . i with they would dim the lighting a little .
3 david 's is a really great place to grab a burger ! it 's a small shop with a 50 's feel to it . they also offer <unk> , mexican food , and breakfast -lrb- all day -rrb- . i managed the texas burger , amy enjoyed a david
3 seriously , this is one of the best asian restaurants in the entire valley . amazing service , quality , and portions at a very reasonable price . i have heard their happy hour is unbeatable too . i just moved to the hood and plan to make flo 's
3 excellent quality food all around and a friendly eager to please staff make for one of the better breakfast experiences in mesa . the decor here is a little old fashioned - kinda feels like having breakfast in kansas : -rrb-
3 same great lolo 's fried chicken and waffles without the risk of getting <unk> or shot ... and it was worth the risk to visit their south phoenix location on occasion . the food is that good , it might even be the ultimate in comfort food ! lucky for
3 a very laid back locally-owned bagel shop at mcclintock & southern in tempe . i really like their bagel breakfast sandwiches . i 'm not much of a bagel aficionado in general , but people tell me these are as good as it gets . this would be pretty much
3 this is a really classy little spot , an awesome change of pace for lunch . fyi - the bar area is a great place to dine too . i will re-visit for dinner soon as it sounds amazing .
2 a little hard to find ... once you are there , its the epitome of a sports bar ... lots of tv 's , 2 pool tables , and a huge bar ! decent bar food - a reasonable lunch destination . unfortunately , every night i have visited here
4 this is a local gem ! 100 's of sodas you thought were <unk> are alive and well at pop . i highly recommend you try a `` hot ginger ale '' . this is kinda like a mall of soft drinks ... or maybe that warehouse at the end
4 tried this for dinner again last night ... this is such a good , healthy meal and at such a reasonable price . the ingredients are so fresh and the experience of getting it right off the grill is really cool . dinner was exactly $ 10 each and included
3 tott 's is a must try if you like asian food . this place has been here for about <unk> , and now has to compete with the pei wei that opened next door - and it if is any proof of how good the food is - they are
3 very much a <unk> offering an eclectic and exciting menu of well prepared items made with the finest and freshest ingredients . the chicken wings and fish and chips are both solid . i hear the brussel sprouts are a winner too . they also have several specialty cocktails that
4 first visit here was last night with my parents -lrb- in from out of town -rrb- . we originally went to houston 's and there was a 1hr wait ... so we walked right across the parking lot , and were seated immediately at veneto trattoria -lrb- it was busy
2 my <unk> <unk> was off the <unk> from the moment we got inside ... lots of fake people and asian <unk> . it is one of the few places this far north that offers live music and dancing tho -lrb- if you 're into that -rrb- . i think i
4 happy hour here is one of the best in all of old town . the food is of such high quality and the service is well above par . your check will make you feel guilty enough to tip generously . fyi - jimmy 's offers more than just terrific
3 i have always been a fan . this place puts out consistently good simple breakfast and lunch - i have never had a bad meal here . they also have an amazing selection of to-go deserts . chompie 's was also featured on `` man v. food '' recently ...
2 i 'd say this is a good spot for breakfast pastries . however , i am not a fan of their lunch offerings . staff are friendly and the decor is pleasant .
3 i love the beef pho and would have loved the spring rolls too if not for the overpowering mint taste - my friend had no trouble fixing this problem for me btw . i will be back once it 's under 100  again - because seriously , soup in
3 good food , good service , good price , shitty location . i had the carne asada plate which came with guac , beans , and corn tortillas . the tortillas were amazing , the carne asada was above average , as were the beans . unfortunately , as good
0 wait , you 're <unk> me , right ? <unk> + wait in the hot sun to eat bacon and eggs ? no way .
4 i did n't know chinese food this good existed , especially in mesa ! being a huge fan of chinese food , i was very excited to try this place after the rave reviews i read on yelp . i was not disappointed ! this place serves up the best
3 two and a half words ... `` gluten-free pasta '' . when i was a kid my family would dine out <unk> 's a week . my parent 's idea of trying new places meant sitting at a different table at the same restaurant . once a place got introduced
1 los whatever this place is just a step above * bertos . just your standard , run of the mill `` mexican '' food . like most mexican food , it 's `` ok '' . nothing special here . i had the carne asada platter with a drink ,
4 if you like spicy food , this sichuan spot has your name written all over it ! known as one of the four great traditions of chinese cuisine , sichuan food can be described as spicy , hot , fresh and fragrant . when you are seated , if you
2 is this place full of douchebags ? of course it is , it 's scottsdale . that being said , this place consistently brings world class dj 's -lrb- donald <unk> anyone ? dj icey ... hello ? -rrb- that you wo n't find anywhere else in phoenix and a
2 decent food , good service , good lunch prices . i liked the fact that when i told my waitress i would like to opt out of the deep fried foods that came with the lunch special , she immediately offered a larger portion of my main dish . nice
4 gold bar was a great find . quite tucked away it seems to draw a very mellow and friendly crowd . what i really like about the place is that it feels like an old world cafe . it 's not `` alternative '' or corporate . its a cozy
4 it was thanks to the yelp reviews here that i realized essence was not just a coffeehouse and bakery , but an interesting restaurant . the decor is pretty non-existent , but the food was something else . i ordered the greek platter , and instead of finding myself in
3 located amidst the huge construction for the light rail system , is this little vietnamese pho house . there is almost no decor and the service is made difficult by the fact the <unk> does not seem to speak english well . but the pho is great . the selection
2 this is a cool little place for a nice little treat . i hope to see them w / a paletas cart in the local farmer <unk> or events , b/c i 'd be alot more <unk> to purchase a $ 3 popsicle when it 's 100 degrees or just
3 i 've come here many a time straight off a hike off camelback mtn , so yeah , my buddies and i certainly ai n't looking pretty . never felt <unk> . i always get the quick start conscious breakfast , depending on someone else to order the dessert style
2 <unk> what we bought and sampled , it was over half the flavors ... maybe the mistake was getting banana bread and pumpkin flavors ... cuz it was an artificial taste mess . the staff was very friendly , and they definitely must keep the toppings area very tidy ...
3 currently my fave thai , and i regularly go to the one in flagstaff after a day of <unk> -lrb- ok that is n't sooo often -rrb- . at lunch i go for the pad thai w / soft tofu , # 2 spicy , egg ok . my vegetarian
2 if you 're indecisive , either go the whole enchilada w / one of the special combo 's -lrb- the first two on the list -rrb- or order your individual dishes . we learned that the hard way . first time we ordered the combo thinking it was a appetizer
3 if you are female , 5 ' 1 '' and petite , you can find camo pants that actually will fit in the <unk> section -lrb- store brand <unk> -rrb- . trust me , i looked all over the valley ...
4 yes yes yes , for every reason all the 5 star reviews state below ! multiple trips to wine country with more than my -lrb- small -rrb- wine fridge will hold , this is exactly the place i want to crack these bottles open and let the atmosphere and food
4 best variety of fruit / pit / exotic trees , with -lrb- hopefully -rrb- appropriate chill hours for our region .
4 besides all the typical reasons that i can find all the asian goodies and fresh seafood , it 's really an international market . i travel out of country every year , so i make a point to hit the aisles beforehand so i know what i do n't have
4 the dim sum place of the west side . also where most -lrb- especially traditional -rrb- asians will hold their wedding or celebratory banquets , due to size and well liked food .
2 have tried it a few times and definitely good chinese food . very good and just what i 'd expect -lrb- my point of reference is sf chinatown -rrb- . tried the different dumplings and as others note - they are fresh ! you can actually watch them making these
2 it is serrano 's and i think people either like serrano 's or they do n't . it will pass for mexican food by many locals and most visitors . as a general rule , i find serrano 's only `` ok '' mexican food . to me if the
3 this is a nice treat for pretty much anyone in your party . fresh , tasty and simple treats that will satisfy your craving without setting you back 700 calories . if you are in downtown chandler , you have to try these .
3 damn , those bartenders are hot ! i 'd rather come here than a strip club . the chicks are hotter -lrb- <unk> -rrb- & i do n't have to watch anyone get naked . i like that wide eyed innocent <unk> look . these girls are n't <unk> or
4 yes ! yes !! yes !! i got to go here & i 'm going to be telling everyone i know that they 're missing out if they do n't try the dogfish shark taco . i actually took a first date here . major points for me from my
1 it 's been a year since i was here ? it 's really been that long ? sadly , i 'm keeping my rating the same . a whole year & it 's still not <unk> with me well . ended up here on a wednesday around 11pm . we
1 this place is hard to rate . i did n't like the bar itself , but i ran into plenty of people i knew & made quite a few new friends . this is n't a `` lounge '' by any stretch of the word . turn right & you
4 why did i have such a good time here , again ? was it because i was with the best of company & just could n't go wrong ? vig sure does make my date nights go well though , i 'll say that much . friday after 11 .
3 i 've been to crazy otto 's a few times now , most recently this past weekend . i was hungry and opted for the eggs , bacon and pancake combo . i got the fair warning of how huge the pancakes are and accepted the challenge . the order
4 thanks to my trusty yelp app on my new <unk> phone i found this gem after eating lunch today . i 'm not sure how i 've never been to a place like this before , but it was pretty amazing . i made a half red velvet , half
3 i have n't done bar trivia in a long time , so coming here with some smart yelp folk seemed as good a time as ever to give it a go once again . the food selection was typical bar food with an extra something here and there . i
3 work has taken me downtown a few times over the past couple months and america 's taco shop has been one of our regular lunch stops . my favorite is the xl carne asada burrito -lrb- probably because it 's normally a late lunch and i am starving -rrb- .
3 good food , even better margaritas . <unk> in senor bob . margaritas go down smoother when they are just over $ 3
3 wings and beer are my pb & j. ... they just go together . this is another restuarant i discovered in the midwest and was glad to find one in arizona . the food is great , reasonably priced -lrb- 35 cent wings on tuesdays -rrb- with beer specials to
0 i just do n't get this place . i know some people like it ... and i 've given it more than 1 try ... but it 's pretty simple -- the food is not that good . specifically , the pasta is cooked with a lot of butter ...
1 the food is ok . i like the ambiance ... it 's a little expensive
0 the bar itself , for drinks only , is ok . it 's very <unk> but ok ... i can live with that . the food is terrible . myself and three others ordered different items . i got the pulled pork ... and it was about as good as
4 i 'm a coffee snob & i have to say this place is really good . i drink americanos and the quality is excellent -- not too burnt but still has good flavor . in addition , it 's hot ... very hot ... which is the way is should
4 i love this yogurtland due to its proximity to home and school as well as the price . yes , i know mojo 's is closer to asu , given it 's on mill , but this place is cheaper than mojo 's and i do love the flavors they
1 i 've had better than this place . yes it had unlimited sushi and other seafood , but the rest of the food was not bad but not good . i found that the only `` highlight '' was the dessert selection . i really would n't go back unless
3 i 've been here once and thought it was alright . i only had the pizza and thought it was delicious - it was the crust that made it super yummy as well as their wine coolers , but there was nothing fabulous that would have me coming back all
3 i super love that they have spam and can add it to things ! love the different types of beer . i had # 3 , a raspberry wheat by grand canyon brewing ; smell of raspberry and initial taste is the fruit with the after taste being kinda <unk>
2 i recently went here for reverse happy hour with my friend , jason , on a friday night . now , north scottsdale is not our normal place and we rarely venture up there but my friend wanted to go . as a girl , i wish he gave me
3 mojo made me fall in love with fro yo . i love mojo 's twitter tuesdays where you can get half off of your fro yo . the location is awesome ; i can go to mojo between classes . it 's here where i found my love of the
3 r n r is beautiful , i just love the architectural features . . delicious before you even step inside the door ! they have two floors of <unk> seating , tons of <unk> and usually great <unk> / sunday afternoons they usually have it loud !! -lrb- which i
4 you would miss this place if you drive by it in a random small strip mall on the side of 16th st , but the <unk> that is so beautifully decorated outside will catch you ! my first trip to la condesa was great , the music is very authentic
3 the menu of salads is expansive !! and on wednesday nights they have a special on the salads for i believe around $ 6.50 . they also have sandwiches , drinks and an outdoor patio . i was really impressed with the salad i had . . i know salads
4 we went for late night before the band north came on , and the chicken fingers were really great , thick breading and <unk> cooked white meat . the waitresses were awesome , i think <unk> helped us out , she did a really good job . i will be
4 the . best . tacos . i 've . ever . had .
4 for pure delight , i have to give this place 5 stars . you must try : very berry turkey sandwich , thai braised beef tacos , apricot bbq chicken skewers , and the red sangria ! i also highly recommend the sunday brunch drink specials ; the mimosas and
3 this might surprise you , but this place does n't have servers . i was expecting a <unk> experience , but was wrong and i 've talked to others who 've thought the same thing -lrb- there are places to sit it 's just more like a deli than a
4 a very unique and excellent place for a first date . lounge areas abound , and the indie movies are a fresh treat . sip wine or chug a beer while to devour film culture .
2 good strong drinks with a hawaiian focus . since i do n't have an extra $ 500 for a <unk> flight to the islands , this is an <unk> alternative . recommendation : drink the blood orange martini slowly . i know no one likes flies , but i really
1 putting a high price tag on a plate does not make it good . service : excellent ambiance : good the food was disappointing and overpriced , the ravioli , undercooked , the blue cheese overpowered the rest of the salad . no shortage of expensive vehicles carefully positioned by
3 very quaint place with personable staff . i tried the iced toddy -lrb- love that for a beverage name , i could n't help but think of `` hot toddy , hot toddy '' from will & grace : -rrb- it was quite flavorful . i added <unk> milk and
3 i have been going to <unk> for a few years now . definitely a solid little bar with decent food , good service , and fun music . just a really good place to chill and have a couple beers . pros : - quick service - good beers on
4 tott 's is awesome ! i remember going to tott 's back when it first opened on mcclintock and guadalupe years ago . i ate there on their second day of being opened and i have loved the place ever since . they had to move locations due in part
1 they have good baguettes and cheeses . pre-made food is not so good and customer service is lacking . maybe it 's an `` oh you 're not a regular '' attitude ? but then again , how does one become a regular ... pros - fresh bread - good
0 wow . i 've never been to such a slow fatburger . i ordered a burger and fries - no one in line , and 1 burger in process ahead of me , and it took more than 30 minutes . i do n't think the cook was aware you
3 a good burger and a good price . the meat was cooked well and the options for condiments was much better than the typical burger joint . the place is pretty new , and is still immaculate and looks like it is organized pretty well .
3 bangers and mash , baby ! it 's a good place . i was struggling between a few choices and the waitress suggested the b & m . it was a good choice . good place - comfortable . it 's not really large , but it 's nicely appointed
2 this is probably the nicest <unk> in az . . i actually would n't mind a mini stay-cation here for a night . their bars and restaurants look decent and worth a shot . just like all the rest of the casinos out here , most of the people that
3 this is probably one of the strangest places i have ever been and it is very difficult to describe . my wife and i took the light rail here from tempe to meet a few friends friday night . the walk from the light rail station to the duce took
2 my wife and i went here last night at about 7pm . the place was eerily dead . there were probably 4 other people in the entire place . i know the saying , `` nobody likes to eat in an empty restaurant '' , but we did n't care
4 great selection , prices and service . i go here every once in a while when i need some alcohol but this review is more about a lesser known service that bevmo provides . every couple of weeks they have one of their wine <unk> come in to do a
3 i 've been here a few times and like it more and more each time i go . the place is uber swank and great for people watching . the bubbles , food and service are n't bad either . i 've been told this place turns into an over
2 just like the other zipps . = ok bar food . ok service . ok prices . love the fries . not really any good beers on tap or bottles .
3 my wife has been wanting to try this place for some time now so we decided to meet 2 friends of ours there on sunday for brunch . i was not as thrilled to try this place because i thought it was going to be yet another typical breakfast place
3 i went here for lunch today and was pleasantly surprised . i ordered the classic double with fried cheese curds . i was less than pleased with the confusing drive-thru situation and waiting time , but it was all ok once i got back to my office and <unk> the
3 this place is a nice addition to the area . the area needed a solid place with good food that is geared to the younger crowd and grassroots hit the mark . they have a menu full of comfort <unk> selections that does n't overwhelm you with choices . for
3 somehow i had never heard of this place until saturday so i had no idea what to expect . we had a giant party of 9 people so it took a while to get seated , but after that everything ran surprisingly well considering the size of the group .
2 i went here last night with a party of 4 . it was about 7pm and the place was pretty dead . a few years ago i sat outside which was good , but this time i sat inside which was interesting . the decor is pretty weird with bat
3 i went here yesterday for lunch during the lunch rush . if my wife was n't with me i would have left because the line was too long for me and i hate waiting . anyway , she wanted to eat here so i had to suck it up .
3 i went here last friday night with a party of 6 at about 8:30 pm . we had a reservation so were seated right away . it looks like this place gets pretty crowded so i would recommend reservations . i do n't want to compare this place to bloom
3 i have lived down the street from this place for almost 5 years and have driven by hundreds of times and not given it a second thought . i would have never considered this place -lrb- because of its location and i had never heard about it before -rrb- if
3 i 've been to the scottsdale location dozens of times but this was my first phoenix experience . i have to say that i like this location better . it was n't way over-crowded or way too loud like the scottsdale location . they do pretty much force you to
0 i go to this place every couple of months when i 'm walking <unk> mill <unk> my house which is less than a mile away . for years i wanted so badly for this place to be my little dive bar down the street where i could walk , get
3 ruth 's is easily in my top 5 favorite steak houses . i 've been to ruth 's about a dozen times in my life and it is always fantastic . i know it is a huge chain and we are supposed to hate them but i do n't care
4 love this place . great food , large portion sizes , great service , and reasonable prices . all big fat greeks are pretty much the same to me and i love them all . i know its not hoity toity fancy schmancy , but i do n't care .
3 i had no idea this place existed until it showed up in the phoenix magazine as a top spot . after reading several yelp reviews it seemed like a solid place to try . my party of about 10 or so people showed up around 7:30 ish on a monday
3 the in-laws are in town so that means a visit to chelsea 's . our party of 7 rolled in at about 8ish and there was a bit of a wait but not as bad as it has been before . the parking lot was n't too full either which
1 i have been here 2 or 3 times since the place opened . i love good bbq , but this place really does n't do it for me . to start they give you biscuits with a side of maple -lrb- i think -rrb- butter which is really very good
3 this was stop <unk> uno on our group 's light rail bar crawl . none of us had ever been there before so we were excited to see what this place was all about . situated about a <unk> minute walk from the light rail station , it is a
2 i guess there is something wrong with me because i really did n't think their beer was all that great . they have the typical brews that all the other little breweries make and nothing really stood out from the crowd to me . i went there last night at
3 this was my first dim sum experience so i did n't really know what to expect . i went on a sunday afternoon and the place was packed but my party of 2 was seated promptly . a few minutes after being seated the carts started coming around with lots
3 excellent food ! fuego 's is actually located in the shops at esplanade cuz yelp map sucks ! haha
3 excellent burgers & french fries ! ca n't wait to try the 3 pound challenge ...
2 let 's start from the beginning shall we . once upon a time in a wiped out section of phoenix you find a quaint 's little restaurant attached to a hotel under construction . actually , my gf had eaten at this place recently so her recommendations brought us here
4 i really enjoyed the food here today ! i have been here before & it was just as good . i have found my favorites so i 'll be back to order them . try the passion tea its darn good !
4 this place is awsome . the food is great . staff is friendly . its really cool looking place . what more do i need ? nada !!!
4 put it simple ... big warehouse for pets . awsome deals . huge selection . you have got to check this place out .
4 wow !!! <unk> prices ! fresh food !!! perfect !
4 oh my g ** ! tini tuesdays rock ! i love the loud music and the foods good . their brunch on sundays is great too . they have drinks specials all the time and i love that .
4 red hot robot is unique in all ways . as the name suggests they sell plenty of robot themed items as well as related japanese inspired toys . i love this place . i saw it front the street and was curious to go inside and do not regret it
4 i have been here several times in the last 10 years . each time is as good as the last one . the chicken , turkey and beef are excellent . not too salty , but tasty . the sides -lrb- especially the cole slaw and potato salad -rrb- are

3 i have to say i like zoyo yogurt and its many fantastic toppings . i stopped by here after lunch for a quick fifteen minutes of peace and <unk> . it was nirvana . i usually mix up five or so flavors and pack on the toppings . however ,
2 i went here last thursday with some alumni from my alma mater . i have to say that the food was alright , not exceptional . we had some fish and chips , potato skins and some other food that does not come to mind . the atmosphere is a
2 shady 's lives up to its name . the first time i was here i left after <unk> a knife fight and before the police helicopter arrived .
3 like many reviewers i could n't resist the red velvet - i swirled the red velvet and cake batter and it was delicious . they have fewer flavors -lrb- 10 total -rrb- than some of the other yogurt places , but it is off set by the expansive selection of
3 tasty home-style food dressed up ... service was great
4 bloody awesome . seriously . ok , my significant other and i walked in around 8 pm on a friday night . i think if we came a little earlier we 'd probably have to wait for seating . we thought the place would be larger , its a little

4 i was meeting a friend to get gelato and instead i wanted a latte to check this place out . they have great lattes ! the coffee was n't bitter and very smooth . the place is a smaller intimate place , but i do enjoy the outdoor seating !
4 my co-worker loves this donut shop and bought me a donut one day and brought it to work . this is now the only donut shop i go to in az . . they are cheap and friendly service . thanks !
4 i had dinner last night and it was delicious ! they bring out these awesome parker house rolls which are warm and delicious ! we ate inside and the ambiance was very nice , they also have a great patio to sit on with a fire place lit during the
3 my review is for the bakery . did you know safeway has a delicious carrot cake ? i ordered a half sheet for an office function . i arrive at safeway and the cake is not ready . the lady who took my order failed to write down what kind

0 i have a very hard time <unk> this place warrants all of the high praise . <unk> the dining in experience is better . my review is based on a catering order of breakfast burritos that my company did . the burritos were poorly <unk> and was difficult to tell

3 i went again on friday and yum ! i got the same ginger chicken and it was just as delicious as before . i need to venture out and try something else on the menu .
0 this wal-mart sucked hard . the cashier was actually very helpful and caring , but did not have the support she deserved from the so called `` management '' of wal-mart . one of the items did not have a price tag on it -lrb- i hate that -rrb- .
4 i love this place . it 's cash only , but there is an atm . once you walk in , the grill is usually cooking some hotdogs and the smell hits you right away . they have all sorts of <unk> of hotdogs and have a great selection of

2 after a rowdy evening our group of six was looking for a breakfast joint that had plenty on the menu to appeal to all of us . despite it 's size , us egg usually has some type of wait time for weekend breakfast . that 's a good indicator
3 what a cool concept ! not ice cream , not a slush , but more of a snow ... or snoh . choose your flavored snow , a topping , and a glaze -lrb- which is essentially a drizzle -rrb- on top . the menu is n't overwhelming with too
3 lindsey d. is right ... this place is way too popular ! after enjoying dinner at little <unk> 's , my friend and i went over to the yard for a drink . it was packed on a saturday night ! we had a hard time finding a place to
4 what a cool place !!! we went here with some friends and ordered about two plates a piece and shared . the plates are small and it gave us the opportunity to try a bunch of different things . my favorites were the red curry with tofu , the tofu
4 it 's a great mall with a lot of variety , but save your <unk> and either park underground -lrb- after 5 on weekdays or anytime on weekends -rrb- or around back . this place is always busy !! i 've seen many stores come and go but they have
1 girls ' night out . we stopped in here after dinner for some cocktails . i liked the decor immediately . dim , cozy , cool looking bar . i did n't really care for where we were seated , but it 's a cool place nonetheless . they have
3 i was working in the area and craving a healthy salad for lunch . my usual love affair salad place was too far so my colleague and i decided to try jason 's deli . he 'd gone there for sandwiches many times and never tried the salad bar .
4 this was our first time here and we went on a friday evening . it 's small and they do n't take reservations so just keep that in mind . we lucked out to arrive at a good time and did n't have to wait . there was about two
4 i really like the decor of chelsea 's kitchen . it 's simple , spacious , and has a warmth to it . parking is very limited but they do free valet . i actually like to park my car myself but you do n't really have a choice here
4 out of this world . great selection on the menu : sandwhiches , salads , noodle or rice bowls , etc. . i 've ordered the veggie burger , the pad thai , and a few of the other rice bowls and have never been disappointed . oh , and
3 i was way out west was n't i ? ok , first time at this arena . we went for a concert and was pleasantly surprised to find it pretty organized in terms of parking . they have multiple lots with <unk> price tags : $ 20 - $ 15
4 first time here , came on a sunday night for dinner . the inside is fairly small , but cozy . they have a large patio dining area with nice lights up , but it 's too cold for that so no one was out there . they have some
4 the concept of a seasonal menu is great , especially at seasons 52 where they have a weekly seasonal specials menu that changes each week , hence the 52 in the name . also each menu item is suppose to be <unk> appropriate and 475 cal or less . sure
3 this is a cool place ! it reminds me of an eatery that should be located up in <unk> . kind of a lodge feel , lots of wood , simple . i skipped the drinks this go ` round and went straight to stuffing my face . our table
4 went here for happy hour which they do from 3-6 <unk> . our table ordered $ 5 margaritas and the sangria , which were both very good . ordered the chips and salsa which came with pico and a nice chipotle salsa . we tried about 4 varieties of tacos
3 have been here several times and just realized have not written a review ! how blasphemous . was here on friday for happy hour . $ 2 off appetizers meant a dozen oysters for $ 10 . not bad . also indulged in some brews on tap . they have
2 i saw this place on pbs `` check please , az '' and decided to give it a try . it 's in a corner of a little strip mall and you can sit outside if you like . i 'll just say `` it 's ok '' . we
4 my first visit to `` the parlor '' . stopped in for a late lunch yesterday and snagged a table outside on the patio . we both ordered the spinach salad . it was loaded with bacon , tomatoes , white cheese , avocado and garnished with a sliced hard
1 first time here . had a late lunch today because we had a gift card from our son . this place is ok . that 's about all i can say ... 2 pizza 's + 2 beers = $ 30 . crust is very thin . go if you
4 short and sweet . 1st time to postino central and love the bruschetta ! omg it 's all good . i might come back very soon and order some `` to go '' . just a thought ... noise level is high . not a place for children . people
4 the food here is really spectacular ! we ordered the sweet potato planks , mussels and the shrimp and grits , and they were all delish ! the sweet potato planks are absolutely wonderful ! a must have for any visit there . the little rounds of sweet potatoes topped
1 i definitely had a 2.5 star visit . the extra .5 is because of the service . the mediocre 2 stars is because of my very blah turkey burger . i ordered a turkey burger , sans the bun -lrb- in my <unk> attempt to cut out carbs where i
1 i 've been to ticoz on several occasions -lrb- but not in several months -rrb- , and the food has always been good , and the drinks have always been better . so my friend and i decided that we would go there for happy hour on friday . we
1 if i lived on one of the <unk> , i would never go to joe 's . however , living in landlocked phoenix , joe 's is where i go when i need a crab leg fix without spending a ridiculous amount of money . i ordered the steamed shrimp
1 this place is terrible . the only reason i 'm giving 2 stars is because the waitress was very nice and tried to be accommodating . having lived on both <unk> , i 'm always skeptical of going to seafood restaurants in landlocked states , and have actually had some
3 i went here with a group for a pub crawl and they were really great ! they had us set up in a nice little private area off to the left of the hostess stand , which was a great set up for the type of event we were having
2 this was my first visit to this place in about <unk> months . the food is always outstanding , so no issues there . today i got the lamb <unk> plate , but <unk> chicken for beef . it comes with either greek salad or tabouli , and i always
2 this place has a great happy hour during the week . they usually have some kind of daily special , like 2 for 1 pizza ! the bruschetta is always good , though a little on the skimpy side compared to postino 's bruschetta . the pizza i had was
4 i was expecting regular shaved ice and was pleasantly surprised at what i found . it 's shaved ice , but with a definite twist . it 's not as literal as shaved ice , but instead is a light and airy substitute . they describe it as `` fluffy
2 food was good as expected , but service was slow . really not a problem since i was n't looking forward to returning to the office anyway haha . we got an appetizer salad to share and i ordered chicken <unk> lunch special which comes with soup , wonton &
2 sound system is good , seats comfy but the `` tables '' at each seat are a bit small & awkward . also the theatre is very dark which makes it difficult to see your food & especially difficult to pay your bill . the movie price was great -lrb-
3 first i should mention the worst part , they do n't open until 5pm . probably not an issue for most people , but i like to eat early ... this was my second time there and this time i was on a date . i love the decor ,
3 i ca n't go 5 stars because i hate self checkout and you have to do it there . other than that , the location is clean , items are fresh and in stock , and parking is easy . when one of the employees saw us stocking up on
1 i co-worker challenged me to a pizza taste test . their choice for favorite is pino 's , so we went there today . i ordered two slices of cheese pizza , since that is the fair way to sample ! the pizza is not bad , but not as
3 in <unk> seats ... well worth the the ticket price . the food is overpriced and some is much better than others . nice for going on a date night !
3 oh my ... delicious ! lunch plans with the girls led us to windsor on a lovely sunday afternoon . i had the crab cake blt ... crab cakes , yum ... add bacon ? amazing ! you have your choice of sides and i had jo 's church potatoes
3 the previous restaurant in this space did n't last long , but rehab burger therapy hit the nail on the head ! they have a great menu of food and drinks and some really tasty beers . there are about a dozen different burgers on the menu and the cool
3 ohhhh ... yummy !! i think i had something called the <unk> ... i love anything with caramel . this coffee concoction is particularly delicious as i later learned it is made with chocolate milk ! they also give you a punch card and after 10 drinks , you get
3 i have been to distrito 3 times now . and every time their food is some of the tastiest i 've had . their service however , leaves the customer often a little puzzled . the servers seem <unk> and as if you 're putting them out by dining there
3 <unk> good chocolate ! priced similarly to what you find at godiva , but you get chocolates that are even more delicious . the shop is gorgeous and the sales people are so sweet offering a sample and information about the chocolates . they have a cute sitting area including
4 i had to give it a full 5 stars as i 've never had a less than delicious experience here . i must 've been here 3 times in the last 2 months and at least a dozen times before that . i 've had nearly every beer they brew
3 like it !! the bf is more in love with this place than me . he always orders the <unk> ... pancakes with coconut , banana and sliced almonds . they are very tasty ! but i tend to prefer savory over sweet for my <unk> meals ... especially if
3 i love this place because they show the smaller indie flicks , <unk> films and foreign pics you ca n't get right away at the large theatres . whenever i want to see a movie and the big studio releases are unappealing , i always watch <unk> for whats playing
1 did not like it what so ever . i had to go because of my friends . i 'm allergic to shell fish by the way . all there non seafood food sucked . i use to enjoy <unk> here for their <unk> . but the last time i went
4 i go to this place on the way home from school . every time , i order the spicy lemon grass chicken with rice . it is really yummy . lots of flavor and veggies which i love . however , i dislike like how they give me only one
4 i do n't know much about authentic thai food but this place hits the spot . i have always hated thai food while growing up , i actually never really liked spicy food . however , my friend took me here once and i ordered the beef ma sa man
1 good place to go if you a fans of irish type of beer and/or any types of <unk> beer . i ca n't really handle the dark beer so i tend to not go there if i do n't have to . they do charge covers to get in ,
1 i only shop here because it 's close to where i work . not the <unk> location as the neighborhood is n't a good location . there are a lot of homeless and weird people hanging out in and out of the store .
3 great place to go to since this is the only place in downtown phoenix that 's actually lit up and actually have lots of shops to go shop at . many different restaurants to try out and a bowling place -lrb- lucky strike -rrb- for you to hang out and
1 i missed america west airlines , all the good services went down once us airways took over . meh , i think i 'll pass . the only reason i gave a 2-star is because this is still the hometown airline from phoenix , but not for much longer .
3 <unk> style western <unk> * heart * next closest place to get something like this is california * <unk> * the menu is ginormous . my only advice to you is to not order any of the americanized nonsense in the front of the menu and skip to the latter
2 i had the soppressata with aged provolone & roasted peppers . it was a solid sandwich overall . the quality of ingredients was pretty good , but the only part that gets me is the price . $ 8 + tax ? wow all that `` supply and demand ''
4 i am a fan of trader joe 's in general , but this location is my favorite amongst those that i frequent . parking : i 'm always concerned i wo n't find a spot , but i always do . they have a lot of shady parking spaces .
3 this new sprouts location is convenient and attractive . it 's set up like all the other sprouts , so it 's easy to navigate the aisles . in general , sprouts has above average produce , a good selection of vitamins and supplements as well as foods with mostly
2 i dined at fleming 's recently on the insistence of a friend , and while the service was good , i thought the food was shockingly high priced for what it was . i had a small filet . it was correctly cooked and tasted very good . just like
3 this place is awesome . a true representation of an old chicago style burger joint . the food is great and service is good . no complaints here . the sliders are amazing and the dog is wonderful too . you won ' be disappointed with this place !
3 this place rocks . great new york style pizza . always fast -lrb- they are always busy and it never takes longer than 20-30 minutes -rrb- . i 'm eager to try some other things on their menu , but when i go there , i just tend to get
3 great little bar . local patrons and cool vibe . do n't expect a party , but they mix great drinks , play chill music , have a rotating collection of artwork , and it 's a cool and friendly crowd .
3 i really enjoy pita jungle . this is another one of our go-to spots . food is always fresh and good . service is also good . food is reasonably priced and you can make it a longer casual dinner , or short and easy dinner -- your preference .
1 so it 's probably not very fair or objective , but hey , first impressions , right ? i went over for a slice for lunch around 1 pm . i 've always noticed that this place does not provide much space to sit or hang out and i thought
2 ok , i 'm torn on this one . i 've mentioned in my other reviews , i understand sometimes , people have bad days . so while the service was not so great , the food was ! and i love this place , i 'm not gon na
3 i disagree that this place is average . well not the menu anyway . i was really impressed . definitely not average bar food . the atmosphere is decadent , yet relaxing and friendly . i went for lunch and i have also been at night . perfect location to
3 i 've been back several times since my first review ! one of my favorite places to eat for sure ! the menu is amazing ! sunday brunch is great ! football , food , mimosas . prepare for a wait most likely but i usually get right in without
2 fast at lunch time that 's for sure . i had a thin crust tomato and basil , skimpy on the basil and was n't that hot but i was starving so it <unk> . my client had the meat <unk> pizza or something <unk> that , she loved it
4 i like the tempe location better but this one is good too ! the church pews do kick ass . favorite pasties : vegetarian balsamic mushroom with mozzerella , spinach , and a side of marinara . peppered steak , the blue cheese in it makes it ! and for
2 pink spot is a cute place . it 's lacking in variety of ice cream flavors though , they have more coffee options than ice cream . the ice cream is decent , but grocery store quality . my husband really liked the root beer ice cream . the prices
1 what time is it ? thank goodness i did n't have to actually ask an employee here , because i woulda been <unk> . i spent a total of about 30 minutes waiting for help with their <unk> shirts program . that 's how long it took me to find
4 nice restrooms . i really should say <unk> that i did n't eat anything here . so why do they deserve 5 stars ? because i want to give a huge shout out to my server -lrb- insert name here -rrb- . i had just come from eating apps at
3 yep , still darn good . we ordered take out this week and it was just as good as always . i wish that i had a chen & wok in my hood in chicago . why is their lo mein so much better than everywhere else ?
3 i love spinato 's . the original location is on smith street in an industrial area of tempe . i live right down the street from the 2nd location at 12th street and glendale ave. there are several locations , but this is my fave . hello ?! byob !
3 i 've ordered lots of cakes and other baked goods from tammie coe cakes . the cake are delicious and beautiful . i 've ordered them for shower , <unk> , parties , etc. . sometimes i even order them and then decorate them myself with fresh flowers or other
2 nothing fancy here , just good ice cream , cookies and other treats . by itself it was n't the best ice cream i 've ever had but <unk> into a made to order custom ice cream sandwich it was pretty good . you choose the cookie -lrb- tip ,
3 awesome pie . went for lunch after the lunch rush so did n't have to wait . i got the bianco and loved it , i probably should n't have n't eaten the whole thing by myself but just could n't stop . service was very attentive and i 'm
4 went here for my husband and i 's anniversary dinner and we fell in love ! not a great place to bring kids but trust me you will enjoy spending time there with your friends or your spouse ! we tried everything but i love , love the skirt steak
3 had a wonderful lunch with my sister and friend yesterday . we ordered the calamari , oriental salad and the eggplant sandwich . all three were delish . vanilla bean cheesecake was terrific . we all shared . our waiter was awesome . always a great time at the factory
3 i like this place for a quick fix . love the bbq with <unk> , eggrolls are ok but i do love the spring rolls . the only issue i have are the boba drinks , they are not very good at all . i wish they would figure it
3 i love indian food and <unk> was a great place for a fast fix . great selection . good service . friendly . very good food !
3 ode to a chilaquiles . so i ate some chilaquiles at pepe 's the other morning . not ever having chilaquiles before i was not sure if my chilaquiles was good or great , but the chilaquiles was good to me . very tasty chilaquiles that is . i had
3 my day job will on occasion get catering from famous dave 's bbq we usually only get pulled pork , chicken , and brisket , the beans , and potato salad . the pork is pretty good . the brisket is smoky . but i do n't normally order brisket
3 i like gelato spot , if i 'm in the area i 'll stop in for something . i love how they have very unique flavors and let you sample them . i could stand there an sample every flavor they have just to avoid paying for some . but
3 i have lived half a mile from tammie coe for about 2 years now and i have never been there . my friends birthday weekend is here , so we have been out and about checking out some new spots and testing others . i wo n't say i have
4 this is my favorite big box theatre . . it is in walking distance and is always empty . but when its not empty , its just as fun . i 've seen cops drag people out of shows , and i 've seen people fighting in the lobby .
3 the toddy here is exceptional . i asked for a iced americano and the barista suggested i give the iced coffee a try , so i obliged and it was exceptional . just the look for it made me inquire . `` how do you make the iced coffee here
2 umm yea . there is nothing all that great about the rula i was here with my bff -lrb- yea like a teenage girl , lol -rrb- cause we was bored and figured get out of the spot . we took the train up to mill already half toasted on
0 ok , first i broke my promise to myself and went here again , i figured by now things have got to be better . i ordered something that i would n't care if it was cold , french toast . ok so the french toast is good . but
4 so two gringos walk into a mexican taco shop next to a mexican bus station ... <unk> bump . omg !! wtf have i been missing here . i got a carne asada burro and a soft chicken taco ... taco was awesome . the corn tortilla was soft ,
4 had a wonderful lunch today with two of my favorite ladies . ms cha cha and the illustrious <unk> <unk> . it was a two part birthday lunching as it was ms. cha cha 's birthday last week and mine is upcoming . we agreed upon durant 's as its
4 to be honest i 'll preface this review to only be about one thing . . ok well maybe two things . the toddy coffee and the vegan donuts i love you . i am absolutely in love with you . typically i order an iced americano and then fill
2 the server 's they hire here are space <unk> . the first time i ate at saddle ranch for brunch i ordered a bloody mary and the waitress said '' i 'm like soo sorry we totally ran out of bloody mary mix '' so i ordered a mimosa .
3 i 'm sure you 're asking how good can breakfast be ? at matt 's it 's the little things that count . instead of giving you a piece of bread from a bag they give you a huge piece of fresh baked bread with real butter and homemade preserves
2 i have enjoyed most of my meals at the vig on 40th st and the food has always been great but the last two times i visited uptown i was disappointed . i ordered some guacamole at after a uye here and it was flavorless . the salsa that came
3 i come here on sundays for $ 1 drinks . the breakfast menu is okay but the portions are kind of small and not very filling . i started to order off the main menu and i am glad i did because the food here rocks . there is something
3 i like this mall alot it has so much in one place ! gameworks , imax , rainforest cafe , saks fifth avenue outlet , neiman marcus last call outlet , <unk> , ross , <unk> , guess , pacific <unk> , <unk> and many more just too much to
3 i love saddle ranch for the fun atmosphere . i really like the food and the people who work here are so much fun ! i i came here for brunch on the 4th of july and the waiter was pretty honest about being hungover and made us laugh the
3 i would describe raising cane 's as the chicken version of in-n-out because they only sell one thing and that 's chicken strips . the restaurant is decorated with movie memorabilia . it 's kind of odd considering it has nothing to do with the food but i liked it
3 i came here on a monday for comedy night and i loved it . the turf is n't very authentic its more of a modern irish pub . everyone hanging out here was really friendly and the comedians were really funny . we had a few drinks and shared the
3 this is my favorite pita jungle location . it 's never too busy and the service is always good . pita jungle has the best hummus in town ! i can come here to eat veggies and hummus and leave a happy camper . my only complaint is that the
3 after hearing this restaurant was on diners , drive-ins and dives i suggested we take our friend here for her birthday because she loves italian food . the restaurant was empty when we arrived and i was surprised how small the restaurant is . the guy behind the counter told
3 i ate here because they have all you can eat crab legs on wednesday and thursday . on a night like this i would expect a full house and line . the restaurant was busy but there was never a line . i like that i did n't have to
3 tryst is an organic cafe located in the desert ridge area . tryst serves breakfast , lunch , and dinner and if you go in from <unk> they will take 50 % off your bill . this is an amazing deal considering most of their entrees are a little pricey
4 i stopped by for happy hour on my birthday we went to the bar downstairs and it was really dark it kind of reminded me of a <unk> . happy hour here is amazing ! we ordered crab tostadas , onion rings , mushroom brie bruschetta , and steak tacos
4 one of my friends insisted that i try lolo 's so we went during a lunch hour . fortunately we arrived before it got crowded . i ordered the a combination plate that included about half of the items on the menu . about 15 minutes later our food arrived
0 this place saddens me . it is a void . it has a sterile atmosphere . the sandwiches were dry and not very good . the prices were high . the only reason that i went was because they handed out coupons in my neighborhood . if i had to
3 i recently revisited spinato 's with my parents and brother 's family . though i thought their pizza was really good i was taken back by how delicious their cheesy garlic bread was . i could have just eaten that with a little salad and have been very happy .
1 the toasted panini that i had cold meat in the center . the music inside was obnoxiously loud . the only reason that i 'm giving it more than one star is because the waiter was very nice . everything else was less than savory
1 i liked the old airport better . i hate large , hard to navigate , walk forever to get to your gate airports . my parents and i once did n't find each other till an hour after i landed because it was so big and confusing . my parents
2 my daughter wanted to be sure to bring me here during my visit because it is one of her favorite places to eat now . i can see why . the atmosphere is very nice , the prices are reasonable and the food is very good . today was ``
4 i discovered this wonderful cheap theater last summer while watching over my mother 's house in chandler and once i found it i went to see movies almost weekly . . how can you pass up $ 2 movies that just left the $ 10 theaters and $ 3.50 popcorn
3 well hanny 's . since that first , really , rather awkward first date we had , i 'm pleased to say that you have won my heart . i 've been back many times since and have some delicious and playful culinary delights to please my culinary comedian palate
3 `` exit to <unk> '' every time i hear this , i 'm thinking , `` there 's a t at the end of left ! a t for god <unk> '' ! then i calm down and <unk> on the homeless man rubbing his feet . while i 'm
1 ra . is blah and the peeps . give me the creeps . service ? makes me nervous . the vibe . just do n't <unk> . just not my scene . i 'm a picky queen . do n't like the <unk> . acting all <unk> . sake bombers
2 i know , i know ... you 've all been to chipotle and it 's probably been reviewed to death . but i have n't been that much and finally formed an opinion . modern , <unk> decor with a minimal and easy to read menu is cool with me
3 i had a $ 20 club sandwich at the ritz <unk> in <unk> i had a $ 30 lobster roll at mary 's fish camp in manhattan . and this weekend i had a $ 19 french dip in phoenix . all of them worth every penny . the french
2 cpk . creative . pizzas . kinda . when i think of the early 90s . i think of cpk . of course i also think of joey lawrence on blossom . but who does n't , really ? and new coke . and we all know how that worked
3 bar smith , a sleek and urban find in downtown phoenix is <unk> . reminds me of many a haunts you 'd find me -lrb- drooling and <unk> over the bar -rrb- in manhattan . first time there we sat at the bar with a friendly , yet overly <unk>
2 i could walk blindfolded and nude around my safeway on osborn and 7th avenue . and still find what i need . blindfolded ? well , to prove my point at how well i know my local market . nude ? well , c'mon , it just sounds fun does
3 copper star is a star baby . the cutest filling station -lrb- yes i said filling station , cuz that 's how old this place is -rrb- turned coffee house in the oh so trendy hood along 7th ave. i love this place . the owners are a wonderful couple
3 comfort . let me spell it out for ya mary . cool ! oh sooo good modern . urban . cozy fabulous . fabulous staff . fabulous clientele . fabulous room . oh sooo good . relaxed . yet energetic . vibrant . t. hmmm . t. . . totally
2 all male employees are required to have the <unk> , messy , <unk> hair look in order to keep their jobs . apparently . it kills me . it 's like attack of the retail <unk> . and the men 's department is n't much more inventive . it 's
1 so we took a gamble when selecting scramble so please forgive my scramble <unk> . ugh . so much potential . friendly staff . but so so food and though friendly , an <unk> staff . upon entering i like the open and airy room . i like the <unk>
3 tottie the hottie . she is such a delight . i 'd like to roll her up in one of those lettuce leaves , garnish with mint and cilantro and dip her right into that amazing fish sauce . but , <unk> , i 'll use her thin , crisp
2 darn . i thought i 'd be the first to review zen 32 ! hmmm . apparently the 32 stands for 32nd street . zen on 32nd street . oh . how terribly clever . i just assumed , after a few visits there , the 32 stood for the

2 i am quite disappointed after reading all my friends brag about this place . i brought my now wife last valentine 's day here and we showed up a little early before they opened and bottles and glasses that were left out from the night before . so we came
3 my wife and i love this place . the only bad thing is not getting a table and getting sat in the crowd of people around the main conveyor belt and prepping station . most of the wait staff is pretty friendly , there a few who just go through
4 this is one of the best places and by walking in the door you can tell there is no secret about this place . it is awesome and again i sit at the bar a lot because then i do n't have to wait in line . this is real
3 my official vote would be 3.5 stars , but i rounded up because of the great service , friendly staff and enjoyable ambiance . my friends and i grabbed sunday lunch here . i love coronado sunday brunch and lunch places . plus , you can head across the parking
4 let me make your life real easy here . when you get lucky later , you can thank me . = -rrb- first , start off with the il <unk> - antipasto , meat , cheese and fruit board . or the mixed vegetables . mmm . course 1 =
2 rip 's is a pleasant surprise . i would rate it 3.5 if that were an option . it 's a lot bigger of a place than it actually seems . bartenders make good drinks -lrb- or you can go for the pbr of course -rrb- and the prices are
3 this place is so versatile , it 's great for lunch with co-workers , a meeting , happy hour with friends , or a date night on the town . for some reason , i love all of the soups that house of tricks has to offer . i think
4 i 'm in love with fresh mint ! this place is amazing . and i 'm not a vegetarian !! we had a gift certificate so we went all out and tried lots of different options on our first visit . i 'll give you the scoop , but for
4 bison bacon , japanese octopus , duck , sirloin in truffle oil ... i had all of these things and many more during my first meal at posh . wow !! i love trying new things , and this definitely hit the mark ! i truly enjoyed myself at posh
4 i love this place ! it 's been around forever . my dad went to high school with the owner , and he and his wife are the salt of the earth . i wholeheartedly disagree with other yelp reviewers who do n't think this is the best <unk> sandwich
3 my parents come here with their friends every friday night . they call it `` margarita friday '' . i occasionally accompany them . this place is always packed , but my parents have the same table reserved for them every week so we always get right in . however
3 oh i absolutely love this place and i say that as a vegetarian ! well dont think i am crazy . for starters , i just love the ambiance and people here , ah makes me feel like i am in the south ! and their portions are huge for
2 really stupid that they <unk> charge 99c to substitute fries for a small side salad !!!! that 's y everyone 's becoming fat lol
4 best burger & fries for the vegetarians ! the black bean burger here is the best i have eaten ever . plus thy have so many free toppings & sauces ! sweet potato & smash fries are the best ! -lrb- hint : try combining them : -rrb- -rrb-
3 it 's one of my fav new places ! i love comfort food . i know what you are thinkin , why would a vegetarian like me , love comfort food ! well it 's the overall package , & it 's not like my most fav food , but
1 5 stars for the delicious food & flavors . no stars for the tired , drab & dusty interior . very disappointed . needs a complete interior update overhaul and face lift . the food is great quality , but their portions are <unk> , and rather unappetizing with the
4 literally , the most delicious food ever , & the comforting , cottage style ambiance tops it off ! i definitely suggest trying the bree appetizer , & the cobb salad is a perfect choice for any hungry tummy !
4 incredible ! perfect flavors , delicious variety , five star service , and perfectly comfortable & inviting interior & patio ! i especially loved the fireplace for a perfect az winters day ! the kale salad was perfection !
3 so here comes one of my favorite lazy sunday brunch at chloe 's corner : grilled cheese with cheddar , swiss , white american , bacon , tomato on white bread , paired with a cup of tomato soup , <unk> . . that 's my comfort food . .
4 this is definitely one of my favorite spots to spend a lazy saturday or sunday afternoon . and especially it 's right next to pane bianco ! lux has a very cozy deco , nice atmosphere , regular tables for who come with laptops , and comfy couches for who
4 had a bday dinner at mastro 's two weeks ago , and it was a great experience ! prices are very much similar to city hall , not cheap ! i was surprised that they had one of my favorite oysters - kumamoto -lrb- from japan -rrb- . the kumamoto
2 it 's actually a 3.5 stars rating . everything was good , but not that spectacular . the place is very spacious and casual , with a big outdoor area . we came here for dinner on black friday , the place was pretty filled yet our wait was not
2 3.5 for my first visit . . i 've passed by this place for i do n't remember how many times , and it finally came to the time that i decided to try it after several friends ' recommendations . restaurant decor is pretty standard bistro looking -lrb- ?
4 ** review for the new saturday lunch menu ** i was so thrilled to discover that sakana is now open for lunches on saturdays , it has been a few months now . what 's more exciting , they introduced new menu just for saturday lunches ! two of the
2 visited don & charlie for two consecutive saturdays for dinner , the first visit was 4.5 stars and the second visit was only an average 3-star , rounding up and down ? hmmm first visit - very impressed by this <unk> restaurant with all collections of baseball , hall of
4 just got back from a quick trip to lgo , tummy is full and happily satisfied : -rrb- three of us arrived around 6pm , had no problem finding a parking spot , lucky ! and we were seated immediately after walked in -lrb- people started waiting for tables around
3 late thursday lunch at the vig for about 20 people out at the patio , we all left with a satisfied smile . vig has a rather larger patio than i expected , it gives you a very cozy feel with the big tree in the middle , the fireplace
3 so this is my first time to a teppanyaki restaurant . we came for a friend 's graduation reception , large group with friends and family -lrb- i 'd say about 30 people ? -rrb- it 's pretty cool to see the chef cook right in the front , our
4 i must say i have drove by this place numerous times but have always been a little deterred to go in . i was n't quite sure what to expect since the parking was so small , the signs of where the actual restaurant was , was n't that clear
3 i love this place whether its for weekend dim sum or for a great dinner . i have been going to golden buddha for a few years now and while they did have a period where the food was n't so great they definitely have stepped up their game .
2 i 'm kind of in the middle with bjs brewery i like to go here for lunch every once in a while . overall the atmosphere is what tends to bring me back its very inviting and relaxing . the food is good i really enjoy their santa fe spring
3 never been to the original location but was happy to see this spot pop up in the `` <unk> '' ; just a hop , skip and jump from our home . i love the modern decor and the patio space . the service was very friendly and the food
3 ticoz is very close to a 5 in my book , which is tough because i am a picky , whining vegan -lrb- well at least that is the stereotype i am trying to live up to -rrb- . they have quite a few vegetarian options that can be made
3 i was not sure what to expect with this place but i told my girlfriend they had vegan donuts and on a rainy , cold sunday in phoenix it seemed like the perfect time to drop in . pulling up and entering this place i felt like i was in
3 i am responsible for fresh n easy . ok , well that is stretching the truth a bit , however i did participate in a focus group for the naming of the store . we were given a whole host of names , word <unk> , different concepts and were
4 best sushi in town ! it is my favorite lunch spot because their lunch specials are incredibly cheap and their sushi is always so fresh . i 've been coming here over 10 years and the atmosphere is the same . we take friends that are from out of town
3 my new fav for sushi in the neighborhood . the conveyor belt is fun , but it reminds me of dim sum - always <unk> for food . the sushi is decent and it is nice not to order an entire roll . we 've been there about 3 different
1 i went here with my hubby on a saturday morning and there were a lot of people outside that were waiting for a table . i walked up to the waitress stand and we were seated right away . i guess everyone else had a party greater than 2 people
0 a previous reviewer gave them 4 stars despite being served fish that was still frozen in the middle , i 'm giving them 1 star for that reason -lrb- primarily -rrb- . i 've eaten fish at several scottsdale restaurants without a problem ; in fact , just last night
3 i have to update my earlier review because i 've become a regular of this place , and quite a fan ! this is still not your ` bay area ' chinese restaurant , but given the location and demographics , you are n't going to get that here in
1 we came here a year ago and everything was surprisingly good . i returned last week , and everything was surprisingly bad ! she had the combo deal with chicken , brisket , and pork ribs . i had the smoked salmon . the chicken was awful - soggy skin
4 the best burgers in the valley , so . i 've been told . came here on a saturday afternoon with some friends , and was blown away by the amazing blue tables , clean glasses and 2 hdtvs . awesome .
0 this place has gone downhill big time ! 2 attempts at a medium rare steak resulted in one overcooked to well , the last being rare with a cold , cold center . basically , they seared the last one ! i guess the costco gift cards , etc has
0 the most amazingly bad service i 've ever received . drinks are good enough , but getting one in an hour is ridiculous ... the staff seemed very friendly , but it 's hard to make up for the lack of <unk> <unk> . management or ownership shows to their
4 they are just downright fluffy . you 've consumed far too many and it does n't even feel like it . they do n't sit in your stomach like lead . it 's the most glorious donut experience ever .
3 every time i walk into this store it 's different . which is fantastic . i love that it 's always changing -lrb- more likely that i 'll find something new that i love ! -rrb- . it 's a great place to shop for hostess gifts , random little
4 we 've never eaten inside the restaurant , but we have regularly been driving home from work and said to one another `` i could really do pizza tonight '' 30 seconds later he 's got his phone out and we 're ordering our regular : big star pizza and
3 thanks to yelp eats my husband and i finally got down to nobuo . word to the wise , if you want to eat here , arrive when they open or make a reservation . it is popular . we kept our dinner fairly simple , kimchee , yellowtail <unk>
3 still awesome . the wonton soup is fantastic when you feel under the weather . strong broth with veggies and tasty wontons . : -rrb-
2 same goodies as the tempe location but much bigger space . this location is rather nice with lots of seating and an ambient feel . i really enjoyed my pasty but i know my parents were n't as impressed . i had the veggie rosemary chicken , yes <unk> veggie
1 i got to say this is probably the most accurate 3 star overall rating i 've seen on yelp in some time . i 'm proud of you phoenicians ! this place was simply meh , especially given the huge amount of delicious mexican food places in az where you
2 good chips and salsa , like that they give you 3 different salsas . both their beans are vegetarian , awesome . i recommend the black bean and cheese burrito enchilada style . some people like the outdoor seating but the smell of the duck pond is pretty sick .
2 last year we tried to get into this place for dinner on a wed and was told 1 hour 45 minute wait . never mind we 'll try again . a year later , i found out they are serving lunch and we gave it another try - this time
4 we 've been to the phoenix art museum several times , but this was the first time we had attended a film -lrb- of sorts -rrb- . it was held in <unk> hall and it was a <unk> from the national theatre in london of `` one man , two
2 okay , so its probably unfair for me to review cartel . i went there to pick up beans . it was pretty clear that the beans i was buying were n't roasted recently . -lrb- they told me they were about to roast . -rrb- but , i was
3 i really like this place . nice friendly atmosphere . drive through . oh , and , small point , good coffee . -lrb- only good -- not great , but i 'm a coffee snob . -rrb- when their wireless shifts from spotty to stable , i 'll be
3 i like this place . there 's nothing particularly outstanding about it . i 'd rate any dimension `` fine . '' but , somehow , all together , it works . homey and relaxed feel to it .
3 coming from the bay area up in california , i 'm spoiled when it comes to japanese noodle houses . i 'm also spoiled when it comes to japanese comfort food . this , my dear ... is freaking fabulous . it 's not ridiculously expensive and it made my
2 i have been a huge fan of rosa 's ever since i was introduced to it . i stumbled upon tia rosa 's just by going through yelp . the moment i visited the website , i thought , `` f * ck yea ... a rosa 's closer to
2 i 've been here once a month since my return . the first time was in june ... i met up with a fellow <unk> -lrb- geek alert ... yes , i do play an <unk> and no , it 's not wow -rrb- who lives around the corner from
3 dropped in today for the first time ... and can i say it 's worth the drive ? no attitude . no c * <unk> <unk> like that other place that shall not be mentioned . cashier , sales people and customers were all so darn friendly and helpful i
1 had a craving for nachos earlier and thought i 'd give this place a try . i ate here once before when we had moved to this area 4 years ago ... and i thought it was ok , but it was something i forgot to yelp about . this
3 i may look like i 'm in shape but it 's clearly obvious to everyone else how little i exercise whenever i attempt camelback . most recently i went a day after i had surgery -lrb- ok so it was my wisdom teeth being <unk> out , but still -rrb-
3 you know when you get a huge plate of delicious looking food and all your dining companions comment that in no way could you ever finish all that food ? a taste of the caribbean is like that . only the food is just that good that you will finish
2 note to <unk> : check zoo hours before going . apparently they close at 4 . on a saturday . when it 's beautiful weather . maybe that 's an obvious close time to everyone else but we sure were disappointed . i guess there is a whole slew of
4 i always take first-time phoenix visitors here and they instantly think i am -lrb- and all of phoenix -rrb- waaay cooler than i actually am . has a great vibe , always jamming the jazz music and has friendly waiters . and do n't forget the pizzookie ! -lrb- sp
3 this place wins the award for most dog-friendly patio in phoenix ! i , uh , just do n't have a dog , so this is more on the less amusing end for me . but holy water dishes and <unk> galore ! they even have a recurring dog photo
3 totally delish !! on my first visit , i was sort of concerned that this place was closed . there was literally not a single other car in the lot . and when i walked in -lrb- door was open ... -rrb- , i was the only person . naturally
1 i went back . and it still smells .
3 here 's the deal ... food is good , atmosphere is cool and the music selection was great -lrb- i heard two songs from radiohead -rrb- . i kinda feel that i over paid for my meal but what the hell , it ' valentines day . pork shank $
3 this time i tried the build-your-own smashburger and it was much better than last time . last time i got the az smashburger and i think the spices overpowered the burger flavor ... but this time it was yummy good .
3 not bad , the decor of the place is great ; it looks clean , new and contemporary ... i did n't really understand why there 's a disco ball in the lobby but what the hell . it 's one of the best fast food chicken fingers <unk> ,
4 i tried this place for lunch and had a great experience . i tried the sausage and peppers sandwich ... that was awesome . they even had march madness on tv . i think the prices are a little on the high side but they 're a mom & pop
4 this is a great new breakfast lunch restaurant that opened a few months ago . the owners also own butterfield 's on scottsdale & shea . the service was fast , food was delicious and the place looks great !
4 you ca n't go wrong at this place ... the burger was great -lrb- best burger in town -rrb- , the fries were delicious , the onion rings were ok ... they even had pbr for $ 3 . plus , there 's always a good group of customers and
3 wow , that was good chinese food . i went at lunch and the place was packed and took about ten minutes to get a table . the prices were a bit high but you get a ton of food . service was good ... the staff are all asian
3 the services was outstanding ; they are great with kids and families . the food was good .
2 it 's really no different from the regular `` my big fat greek restaurant '' other than you order from the counter . the food is just as good and the prices seemed the same - i 'd rather go to the actual restaurant but for carryout , i enjoyed
0 the toddy was good , the food not so much . it was pricey and there were a few too many flies buzzing around for my liking .
3 i do so love pita jungle ! i usually get the mediterranean platter , which is enough to share and has a bit of everything on it . a few times i 've gone they 've been out of falafel but are more than happy to <unk> . the chicken
3 i really like this place , except for the weird smell . once you get past it , the food is really good . i 've gotten green curry chicken both times - first spicy and then thai hot . both were amazingly spicy but not overpowering . the portions
2 teharu gets three stars for the price , the fact that it has a conveyor belt , and the <unk> <unk> salad wrapped in tuna with avocado on top . the sushi is meh , i 'm not sure why they have servers , and it 's usually a wait
4 out of all meals in a day , a hot , yummy , and healthy breakfast is my favorite . my girlfriends and i arrived to the breakfast club , located in lovely old town scottsdale on a saturday afternoon . yes , it was n't quite morning . we
2 pizzeria bianco ... the paris hilton of pizzerias . -lrb- popularity wise . . not sleazy overrated celebrity wise -rrb- the extremely popular pizzeria captured my interest once i learned that this little restaurant was featured in magazines and even the food network . i am definitely a pizza fan
3 great old 50 's ambiance . waiters and bartenders are professionals and ensure that you have a good dining experience . steaks are good . my preference is always the rib eye . i also like to order the stone crab when it 's in season .
2 adovado pork melts in your mouth . the rest is nothing special . i do n't usually go there unless i 'm with a group that insists on going because the wait is ridiculous and not worth it !
2 great little spot to meet your girlfriends for brunch . it has a girly girl feel and is great for birthdays and showers . there 's a private room available for parties . the food is good . service is so-so , they can be a bit pretentious . good
4 love this place . the atmosphere is cool but the staff and food are what makes it . we now got to cph every time we are in town . we sit at the bar and watch thomas do his magic . damn he makes good cocktails . he is
3 love this place . they serve alcohol and no food which equals great people watching . cougars are on the prowl , band is great and my new drink of grape vodka and soda is awesome . good times .
1 my boyfriend and i are visiting from san diego and were looking for a good happy hour . the <unk> brought us to this place . the vibe seemed pretty good , the music was pretty good but the people watching was actually the best . the bartender staff were
4 yes , i know , i ca n't believe i would rate any restaurant a 5 star . the only other restaurant i have ever rated a 5 star would be razz in scottsdale . we stay at this resort every time we go to arizona and we tried the
4 how can you say anything bad about lolo 's ? this place has it all figured out . decor , service , food & atmosphere are all part of the experience . i think certain restaurants really get you into the mood to eat there , and lolo 's is
2 i had heard this was operated by the same peeps that rock delux and zen 32 , so i had to give it a try . living in arizona , there is always room for another fantastic burrito and restaurant to serve it , but sadly , i 'm not
4 my jaw dropped when i stumbled onto this place . i could not believe that a store like this existed outside of a city on either coast . this store is truly a slice of geek heaven in the form of toys , clothing , and even a boss selection
4 one thing about phoenix is that it 's near impossible to find french food , and good french food at that . well , look no further than au petit four . i 'm french , so i 've got to admit that i 've got a bias for eating
2 if it were n't for the beer here , this place would just be another sports bar type of place . just cover the floor with sawdust and it 'd be set . they 've got a great selection of beer and that 's it and that 's all .
2 at long last , i saw <unk> <unk> here . totally worth the wait and line . what to say about this place ? really , it 's just a spot where you go to see someone on stage in a <unk> setting . this place was way bigger inside
3 this spot was always a regular drop for me when i was spent time studying for the <unk> at the library . from what i 've heard , this place has been around for quite a while which is a testament to the food they serve . it 's important
2 if it were n't for the top floor here , this place would be pretty lame . a <unk> two stars . after thinking about it , i 'm really all over about this place . the cons ? the crowd , ridiculous cover , and overall space . the
3 the food and beverages here are as good as the cause that this place stands for . i was really surprised to see how this place actually was because i was expecting some sort of folk jam <unk> <unk> reading spot where <unk> sack tournaments were held . even though
3 fun little bar in the arcadia area . i finally made it here after hearing rave reviews and it 's a very cool spot . they have decent beer on tap and creative fun cocktails . sitting around drinking can get a little boring , so i was happy to
3 this is my go to place when i want a cheap quick meal without having to get fast food . they have healthy options and use fresh flavorful ingredients . their portion sizes are generous and the staff is always nice and friendly . my favorite is the greek salad
2 my husband and i went to rooftop yoga at the palomar , and wanted to grab dinner nearby afterwards . we were looking to eat something lighter , so we stopped into squid ink . the decor was very nice , clean , & modern and our server was great
4 so convenient , i 'm in love with their salad bar ! i also love that they list all of their ingredients in everything so that i know what i 'm getting , they also point out allergens in their food . i eat here about once a week ,
2 good for a fast healthy option that is reasonable priced , although you have to know what to order . i really like their tabouli , tossed greek salad and roll up entrees . everything else i 've tried has not been so great , the chicken is always overcooked
1 i decided to try this place for takeout for lunch today since i was craving some mongolian . this was my first time here and i 'm familiar with the concept since i 've been to yc 's . unfortunately it did not live up to my expectations . pros
4 we tried this place for brunch and ca n't wait to go back for dinner . we sat on the patio which was very nice and shaded . i decided on the strawberry lemonade to drink , which was strawberry infused rum , fresh lemonade , and muddled basil .
3 anyone who is familiar with the night scene in scottsdale , has stumbled their way to this pizza joint at some place or another after the bars have let out . the pizza is greasy and tasty but definitely the cure to sober up and line the stomach with something
3 what 's walking distance , tasty and cures my sweet tooth ? yogurtland ! yea i said it . they have a great choice of flavors and i love there topping choices as well - and well the price is perfect . you pretty much determine how much you want
4 i finally made it into this place and totally stoked ! i gave up drinking soda a long time ago , and will have one every once in a great while but after walking through the pop doors , i 'm in trouble . they seriously have everything in this
3 if you 're looking for a quality salad with great ingredients i definitely recommend this place . they have plenty of other choices to select from ranging from salads , sandwiches and pizzas ; i 'm just a bit partial to the salads . you can do a `` create
1 so i 'm very dissappointed in the service and probably wo n't be back unfortunately . my mother and i decided to try this locale out , since i have n't since living on this side of town . well we waited a couple minutes before anyone approached us to
2 tried this spot last weekend for lunch with my boyfriend and his sister . i ordered hummus with chicken , my boyfriend got the lamb gyro and his sister ordered the feta , tabouli and <unk> gyro and we ordered a hummus appetizer . ok , so the appetizer reminds
3 ca n't say i had the food but the bar on a sunday is awesome ! $ 1 mimosa 's and watching the game = priceless , plain and simple . they had a handful of other specials ranging from draft to saki . definitely a worthwhile trip on a
3 if you like chicken and you love cheese , and are n't counting the calories , you must get the pollo magnifico . it 's a deep fried burro filled with chicken and topped with jalapeno cream cheese , cheddar cheese and served with rice and beans . so delicioso
2 the menu is minimal and the burgers are solid . quick and easy .
4 birthday lunch ! great big one with bacon and cheddar . love it . long lunch line , moves quick , worth the wait ! this is one of the great burger shops , the decor , the smells , the cash only , all add to its personality and
2 the food is decent but overall i think the name is a stretch . had the carne asada taco
3 tried out this place and sought out their italian beef sandwich . it was a monster and nearly impossible to manage eating . glad i had this one to go ... probably would have looked crazy trying to eat it in public ! lol
3 went for the yelp ultimate science fair , and this place was really sweet . i think we had the most fun playing around in the human body area . there were many great exhibits though . i look forward to going back sometime when i have more time to
3 very good food . i have eaten here several times and have had no complaints with their execution . really nice patio area secluded in trees and shade with a full service bar in the middle . great place for lunch . one of tempe 's gems .
3 easy to get to via light rail and if you have a <unk> arena event ticket , you can ride the light rail for free ! i went here for a <unk> wrestling event -lrb- i will never go to another btw , it was terrible . im not much
3 wow lots of beers here as you might guess from their name . definitely a change of pace from most of the other bars on mill ave , they dont even serve liquor ! i stopped in here on a tuesday right after they opened and it was pretty packed
2 fun place , fun music , been here dozens of times and can tell you that the vibe of the crowd on any given night can really effect this place . ive been here on some nights when i would say its the best bar in the world , and
4 great chai lattes and great atmosphere . they have a menu as well as decadent pastries . they have tables in the front with outlets so you can study and plug your laptops in . there 's also a back room if the music is too loud , but it
4 love this theatre . yes , it cost a little more , but the seats are ten times better -lrb- although the cinema suites recline and have a leg rest -rrb- and you can have <unk> while you enjoy your movie . the screens are huge so any seat you
4 been here many times . always great and fun .
3 i 'm a fan of danny 's car wash . . i use to get 50 % off of car washes being that i was an asu employee , but apparently the corporate deal for all businesses ended in 2012 . i do n't usually get a car wash unless
4 is there really anything that can be complained about when it comes to tj 's ?!? favorite place to shop , hands down . as if the items they carried were n't enough to keep me coming back , the staff is the topping on the cake ! always friendly
3 we love this cheap theater ! we 've always received great customer service and the place is kept really clean . when we left the theater today , there was a <unk> of workers armed with <unk> ready to clean it for the next showing . the only time that
4 we have tried many middle eastern restaurants over the years . i was introduced to haji baba during my college years - almost 20 years ago . hands down , it is the best middle eastern food around and the prices ca n't be beat . we moved to utah
4 went again last night . more of the same kind of awesome . tried the papaya mango spring roll . . so hot . literally . so good . the lemongrass clams were also amazing . <unk> this place up on wednesdays , is a good move because of the
3 ride it every day . it 's still clean . i like it a lot . & of course i think it should run later , and i wish there was a lot more bars within walking distance of the stations . i think i like the camelback station the
4 yum . but , i do not come here that often because i can not help myself , as i am seriously addicted to refined sugar . oh , the cookies here are better than the -lsb- cup -rsb- cakes . but everything i have tried is just , amazing
2 i wish i could find another place that made a dan dan noodle bowl -lrb- besides pf changs -rrb- , until then , pei wei will just have to do . extra sauce and bean sprouts , please .
1 small selection and kind of overpriced . definitely avoid on wednesday nights . as saturday mornings are much more lively .
3 great calimari . ahi tuna was very yummy . great service too . tuna tartare tacos were awesome , order 2 ! another sam fox hit !
4 great fish tacos . small but very tasty . cheese quesadilla was good also w queso fresco . the green sauce was smoky n spicy but not overbearing . def will be bk 4 more ; -rrb-
2 alright , let me start this off by saying that i had a hard time deciding if i wanted to rate this place 3 or 4 stars . my initial reaction was a 4 , but there are a few things that really bug me here , so i really
1 we have dined at this flemings location numerous times before and had wonderful experiences , however , this time things fell very flat . things started off fine with water and a wine list that was provided via ipad . my fiance 's mother asked the waitress for wine recommendations
3 went here last night with my girlfriends and had a really fun time . the doorman let us in without having to wait in line , which was awesome seeing as this is the newest bar to open up in scottsdale and it was packed . the patio was the
3 this is a very unique restaurant to visit for special occassions ; i love how everything is underground ! the bar 's selection of liquor is very impressive and pretty affordable . dinner has always been superb on my visits . my only complaint is that sometimes you get stuck
1 the only good thing about this place was the excellent tasting and unique cocktails . the buck stops there . i came here last night with a group of ten and although they do n't take reservations they ended up reserving a large table for us , which was pretty
3 mucho gusto is probably one of my favorite lunch restaurants . the patio is very charming and just lovely to sit on when the weather is nice . i love the tacos they serve here , and the margaritas are strong : -rrb- i recommend coming here only for lunch
4 i am <unk> for this place and i do n't even drink coffee . i went with a friend this weekend and had a -lrb- delish -rrb- brownie coconut thingy . the glass front of the coffee house was opened like a sun roof -- it was absolutely beautiful .
4 update : <unk> ... i am back on the oregano 's bandwagon !! i had a <unk> experience a couple months ago that i included in a review update on yelp . after posting my review , their pr representative promptly reached out to me , apologized and asked us
2 update : the food at parlor is always amazing , but customer service is important too . i used to work in the food industry , so hospitality and professionalism are things i appreciate and to be honest , expect at a nicer restaurant . yesterday i went with a
3 yum , yum , yum , yum . what can i say ? i love lamb . the persian room is the perfect place to go on a quiet date , a family get-together , whatever . all of the food is absolutely delicious . there are all different types
4 update : please , please reverse the changes to your burger seasoning and french fries . the shoe string fries were your signature potato , the new fries just are n't as satisfying , -lrb- neither is the new portion -rrb- . the cheeseburger is really over-salted now . please
2 ive been here twice and the food is incredible . as well as the brews . however i have been disappointed twice by the awkward seating , no a/c and slow service . i even had an entirely different plate than what i ordered placed in front of me .
3 excellent place for food . i 've only been here twice but the food is so tasty . i really love the atmosphere of it , especially on a saturday or sunday brunch time . 4 out of 5 simply because they 're never open !
2 cool atmosphere . questionable art . drink selection is nice when its actually in stock . i almost never come here at night time , not worth the waiting and crowd . great service otherwise .
3 wonderful food . i love that i have multiple options of beverages and <unk> and all of them have been above what i <unk> expected . i love being able to wake up and walk down from my apartment for a treat . great service too ! i just wish
1 it 's an outdoor mall like the biltmore , but nowhere near as upscale or charming . it <unk> attracts a different <unk> , typically a college crowd , high school <unk> who ca n't wait to be the next sorority <unk> and families with <unk> children running <unk> .
2 this place definitely takes advantage of its surroundings , promoting its urban feel . it 's easily accessible from the light rail , sits right on the northern edge of downtown , is close to the public market and <unk> to growing number of businesses in the area . its
4 this location opened up not too long ago and after a few months of <unk> i finally went . i love wine - well , a lot of it anyway - so i knew i was going to love it . it did n't disappoint either . they have sections
4 i 've been traveling every week since 2003 and southwest airlines is my airline of choice . the reasons are many : simplicity , great customer service , the high frequency of flights , <unk> , no change or baggage fees . southwest has earned my loyalty .
4 found my new favorite italian restaurant in the area . i had the `` tour of rigatony 's '' and loved it . the cappucino ice cream pie for dessert is a must .
2 the restaurant was n't bad but nothing blew me away . the fundido -lrb- steak -rrb- was good , as long as i did n't think about how many miles i 'd have to run afterwards to <unk> it . i 'm a huge dessert fan and their deep fried
4 i simply do n't understand some of these reviews below . people are knocking the place because they steam their meat instead <unk> it ? c'mon . so you ca n't handle something different or what ? so for this review , i 'm comparing it to subway and quiznos
3 maybe not the most filling <unk> i 've ever had ... but good . it always is . i went there late a night and sat by myself -lrb- sad , i know -rrb- and just played scrabble on my phone . maybe someone from yelp will come keep me

3 i miss their free house margaritas for checking in . i like this place . negative is that on the weekends the dance floor is ridiculously packed to the point that nobody is dancing at all ... more like a <unk> pit with douchebags carrying 3 drinks through the middle

1 been here a couple times for food . once for a beer . food is quite good -lrb- green chili -rrb- but their customer service is very lack luster , and i 'm not picky . the people up front always smile , but it is always one of those

2 really wanted to love this place , as i 'm drawn to tiki themed establishments like a <unk> to light . we went in the early evening -lrb- maybe 5:30 or 6 -rrb- to partake in some happy hour specials and ordered ceviche , one of the house specials .
3 the food is great . the onion rings and dogs are great . the ordering process is <unk> . especially if it is busy . is it worth it ? yes . will it feel worth it until you are at your table with your food ? no .
4 no more mr nice guy pasta . get it , enough said . they also have the big unit -lrb- huge hot dog -rrb- and good burgers . food is excellent and quick . dont come here to drink , but go there to drink and eat .

0 it starts with the chips and salsa which the chips are bland , the salsa is <unk> and tasteless . the margaritas are good but small and pricey . i ordered the carna asada and enchilada . the carna asada was quite good , the enchilada was non-existent . i
3 i ignored going to kona for awhile because of it 's weird menu . unlike z-tejas , kona could n't figure out how to <unk> food . i went there for lunch and the menu was <unk> different . tried my dads burger and it was good and huge .

3 wowza ! this place is pretty neat . i secretly yearn to be ultra organized , but rebel against those <unk> daily . walking in here made me want to work here looking at all the ways to keep things in their place and finding a place for everything .
4 this has been my favorite sushi indulgence . i the times i have been there i have yet to sit at the grill area , and i find i enjoy sitting in the lounge much more than the dining room . on my last trip there we took some visiting

0 i have been regretting this review . why ? because i did my research , was looking forward to trying it , i read the reviews and i was comfortable that i knew what to expect . i went in on a whim on <unk> . i truly did enjoy
3 so why am i a fan ? it 's about a block from home , and they are open on sundays , that 's why . well not just that , i enjoy the fact that when i have been there it is not too over crowded -lrb- unless i

4 we were on a mission , not one of pizza in general , we just did n't want to go home . so we roamed the streets of the <unk> valley . it started with a late breakfast with drinks which kept taking us north and then east , eventually
3 i usually steer away from places that have large lines and after a certain time i wont dare go here cause it can be hard to find a seat and the food does take a while to make but if you are taking a lunch around 11am you can squeeze
2 i think this is one of them places that are more of trend over substance . the sandwich was ok , the bread with lemon and dried tomatoes was <unk> but nothing a wild flower sandwich could n't compare to and i am not too big of a fan of
4 this is place is a weekly trip for us as my girlfriend loves the salmon and martini 's they serve here . we have been frequenting this place ever since we moved to the area versus the rare trips we would take for the awesome cream cheese chocolate cake made
3 delicious sandwich , croissant was delicious . i went after 1pm and many things had already sold out .
3 well , our initial plan was to go to tuck shop as i 've been wanting to try it out . unfortunately two ladies got there 1 sec before us and got the last table , the waiting area was packed with a group just <unk> ' and they had
4 beautiful grounds , great rooms and the restaurant is excellent !!! it 's our favorite place for brunch . the room we stayed at was great and the bed was so damn comfortable that we woke up in the middle of the night to comment on how comfortable the bed
3 we like firebirds . service has always been great , and food is very good and reasonably priced . the bread they bring before your meal is delicious , especially when is hot from the oven . i had tried the quesadillas , buffalo meatloaf , sirloin steak , and
1 my husband and i went to elements two weeks ago for date night . it was our second time , our first visit being over 3 years ago . we could n't get a table then and ate at the bar , food was pretty good . i made reservations

2 i ordered a torta mexicana and three asada tacos to go with the anticipation it would the best kept secret . i have to say the asada had no flavor . the bread was good with the torta all the ingredients are as fresh as your gon na get .
4 nothing fancy about this place . i had to check it out because my boss has been lunching here for the past 10 + years . i now understand why . the sandwiches and homemade deli salads are delicious . i had a salami and provolone sandwich the french roll
2 really nice venue and the food was fabulous , but the service will not get me to go back there anytime soon . the service slow and it seemed like the staff did n't have it together , makes me wonder how much money they must lose per night .
4 i had brunch at st francis today . from the moment i stepped in , the who restaurant smelled like good food . i had the gravy biscuit topped with a fried egg . the gravy was not the typical heavy gravy , it was made with the perfect <unk>
3 i cant believe it took me along to give <unk> a review . i order lunch delivery from cider mill at least once a week . i have tried many things on the menu and never felt dissappointed . the <unk> of the food is so fresh and well thought
3 i have been here a handful of times since they opened . the atmosphere is good , weekends are crowded . honestly favorite day to go is sunday for brunch or lunch . this would be a good place for a birthday celebration . there is plenty to try and
4 i 'm addicted to the simple bean and cheese burritos , homemade , no crap in them and everything a bean and <unk> should be . i need to <unk> myself from having too many , i do n't want to get sick of them ... savor the love .

1 as a native southern californian , i was looking forward to some good mexican food during a recent business trip to phoenix . <unk> amigos in arizona center was a <unk> choice for lunch downtown . it was a late lunch -lrb- like 1:30 -rrb- so the place was mostly
1 way overpriced and really run of the mill pizza , found the crust to be tasteless and boring and really feel ho hum about the whole meal including the hummus . the beers were the stars here and if that is what your coming for then you wont be disappointed
2 we come here for breakfast and its always pretty good . the place is crazy busy on the weekends so expect a wait but not to long . its pretty crowded and can be a little hectic . the prices are great and the portions are huge . nothing fancy
2 as soon as i ordered the seafood combo i knew i ordered the wrong thing , it came with some bbq chicken all dark meat , the flavor was good but dark meat <unk> me out , the shrimp was really good , light and crispy but not a bit
2 i am sticking with the original 3 star rating after having my birthday dinner there last night with my husband . here is the good and the bad the good 1 . the bacon cheese burger in my husbands opinion was the best he has ever had . 2 .
1 you know i simply do n't understand why so many mediocre restaurants get such high ratings here in phoenix . is it because many of the patrons have not been to true 4 and 5 star restaurants ? postino 's on central falls into the mediocre category for me and

2 i enjoyed my meal here , maybe not as much as yc 's , but enough to get me back if i 'm in the area - looks like there are three more locations coming soon , so i 'd probably do one of those , since the tempe marketplace
2 i was reasonably happy with the food here . ordered a beef chimichanga with rice and an extra tortilla on the side . the chimi was just a little dry , with lightly seasoned shredded beef - probably could have used a little more of a kick , but it

4 update : still have n't tried the dim sum . i 'm not that big on dim sum . but their regular dishes are excellent . i love the noodles here .
3 gave it another star because i keep coming back for papaya juice , plus they have very nice food too . so many excellent asian restaurants around dobson . it 's like being back in ca !
3 great concept . you basically get to build your own sushi . generous portions , each roll was about 10 <unk> . lots of options and very good ! the owner was there and very personable .
2 this is more about experience than food -lrb- in my opinion -rrb- . do n't get me wrong , the food is good but its way expensive . me and friends went and had a great time and if you 've never done the fondue thing , you should try

1 the ramen here is absolutely horrible . i still come here because of 2 things . my friends like it here and it 's really the only ramen place in the tempe . bottom line , this place is for people that had never experienced excellent ramen other than the

4 i love cibo . i 've been here for lunch , dinner and take-out . they have never messed up an order or made anything less than perfect . it 's my favorite pizza in phoenix since i gave up trying to go to bianco 's . one order must
3 adding my four stars to the duck & d. i go for a `` <unk> '' whenever i remember this place . made to order sandwiches on fresh breads with a crunchy pickle slice and small candy ; nice wine selection with helpful wine staff . the duck has sold
1 this place used to be great , with unique dishes , yummy breadsticks with special butters and complimentary white chocolate for dessert . now it 's just average , with nice outdoor seating .
3 this place is funky , and fun , and i have no idea why i had n't been there until last week ... i came here the other day for a birthday , and my god , am i glad that she chose this place !! its got that indie

2 i try to stay away from chain restaurants , especially <unk> joints , because the food that is delivered is overpriced , not awesome and usually available in your local supermarket in the frozen foods section . that 's pretty much what you 're going to get at rock bottom
1 i am not going to say much about this place because the only thing i really liked about it were the light fixtures . i tried the crystal chicken . bland . i tried the crispy <unk> rolls . overcooked . the only thing that was yummy was the #
3 this review is for the bar only ! first time i came in here it was packed to this gills , and no where to sit so we left . . next ! second time i came here i met 2 of the strangest old women i 've ever encountered

3 i had been meaning to visit this place for awhile and the only regret i have is that it took me so long to swing by and have a taste . they have a decent and well priced lunch menu as well as a large assortment of italian pasta and
3 there is not a lot that i can say that has n't already been written about , but if you are on a dairy free diet , this is the place for frozen confections . they have a very good selection of homemade dairy free sorbets . coconut , pineapple
2 tried this place for dinner tonight . while it was decent , i did n't love it . we got 2 entrees and 1 appetizer for the family . i ordered the chicken bun which came with 2 spring rolls . the kids split an order of pork spring rolls
4 all i have to say is ... mimosa saturdays <unk> !!! oh and the bloody marys with the yummy little pickled green beans in them . definitely winning !
4 i love the salads here . they are so flavorful without adding too much . i always get the chinese chicken salad , but i have tried the caprese salad and the beet salad a few times and i am very happy with all of them . i also really
3 the pho here is excellent and the price is even better ! it 's not in the way of ambience but it 's not too shabby either . went here with 3 friends and everyone was very happy with their food . you know everyone is satisfied when not a
4 lollicup is pretty awesome , and i ca n't decide if i like them or boba tea house better . lollicup 's boba is a bit more chewy , while boba tea house 's is a bit softer . i like the softer boba , but boba tea house 's
1 nothing would make me happier than finding good indian food in the phoenix area . unfortunately , that has n't happened yet . we started off our meal with two kinds of naan - one stuffed with lamb and one stuffed with chicken . the lamb naan was very mediocre
4 cool place , au <unk> 2 burger is my favorite and quite decadent , one of my favorite burgers in town ! great cocktails , see and be seen type of sexy fun place . i have been going here for over 10 years , and rarely have a complaint
3 have eaten from the drive thru a few times , great <unk> , fresh tasting sandwiches . i had the club and the chicken sandwich and both are good . the menu is really simple , wish they had one or two more choices on it , but overall ,
4 environmentally responsible french eatery . <unk> -lrb- <unk> sourced ingredients -rrb- , and the pastries are great also . relaxing vibe , patio seating if you bring your dog . always a treat to eat here . i regularly order the <unk> <unk> , but had the special today which
2 wine = very good . food = tasty . service = not so good . wish they focused more on checking in throughout the meal and we would come back more often .
4 my husband and i shared bruschetta to start . we enjoyed all three , but he particularly liked the fresh mozzarella -lrb- delicious fresh basil !! -rrb- and i liked the prosciutto and fig -lrb- rich , sweet , delicious ! -rrb- . i had the lasagna bolognese with garlic
2 went to mabel 's for happy hour the day before july 4th -lrb- err , that would be july 3rd -rrb- . very quiet , <unk> crowd . service was prompt and very good . cocktails were a bit disappointing , i had a <unk> which was fair and an
3 definitely the king of the tortas . i love this place , great tortas and aqua frescas . it was featured on man vs food a couple of years ago , mainly on the reputation of their torta del rey , an enormous sandwich generally enough for 2 meals for
3 ok ... this is along the line of the 3 d 's ... diners , , drive <unk> dives . when i think of some of the best bar b que i have had , it has been in some really off the wall spots . well stacy 's is

3 needed a unique restaurant to host sandra 's birthday party and suggested we get a teppanyaki table as the grandkids would have a lot of fun at the table . that suggestion was a hit ! the kids eyes were `` wide open '' during the whole cooking <unk> and
4 i can fairly say that i really enjoy the dining experience in this place . i started with agedashi tofu and soft shell crab for appetizer and both of them tasted good . the agedashi tofu is really soft and makes me crave for more , and the <unk> of
4 the most impressive quality of sushi and sashimi ! i highly satisfied . the price is more expensive but the quality of the food is superb . they have the best ama ebi nigiri in the town ! the shrimp is so sweet and the sushi is superb . what
4 love the service and the food ! i always crave a good chicken bbq pizza with thin crisp and this place offer that and so much more .
3 i found this place accidentally as i cruised around phoenix downtown , but i 'm having trouble to park as this place is located right inside the historic heritage square . if you go to nobuo , make sure you order 6 kinds of food cause they only provide a
4 another excellent find in scottsdale . the service is wonderful and the food is extremely flavorful with good size portions . the sea scallops and herb chicken are highly recommended .
4 there 's an irish pub in california that used to be the home of my favorite burger . that 's no longer the case . the bbq burger -lrb- upgrade to the organic , grass fed beef -rrb- with cheddar cheese , fresh coleslaw , and bbq sauce is the
4 i 'm generally not a french food fan but this <unk> infusion restaurant has completely won me over . the food is indescribably good . do n't let the location fool you , the interior makes you forget where you are . to top it off the chef is incredibly
3 ***** the service was fantastic , there was a nice warm lady attending the shop and the gelato was awesome as always !!! ** yummy chocolate caramel fudge brownie !! : -rrb-
4 i came here by myself on a thursday during happy hour , since sadly none of my , `` friends '' had the time or desire to join me !! : -lrb- well , they missed out !!! this place is <unk> , colorful and clean . i had the
3 very easy hike , highly recommended for beginners !!! trail is paved and <unk> around the widely shaped mountain . incredible views at night , the only complaint is the lack of better and closer parking , the parking adjacent to the mountain is limited to about eight spaces ,
4 this is the most amazing place ever !!!! ***** i feel in love with this small restaurant as soon as we walked in !!! the owner carlos is fantastic and the food was the best latin food i have had in my short lived life so far !!! it is
4 oh my goodness !!!! it took me this long to write up a review for nothing bundt cakes , they are truly amazing !!!! i prefer this over a cake anytime for my birthday , and everyone who knows me knows this is very true !!! i have been in
4 i honestly really like this place !! i get it !! it 's mostly because i get this sweet groupon deal , movie and drink for just $ 6 , get out of here !! no , but seriously , this place is small and quaint , but very accommodating
4 amazing light show , great time for those fascinated with christmas lights and animals !! i loved the light show they offered in the center of the pond . lights dancing to the rhythm of the music , amazing !! highly <unk> to those with kids or young siblings !!
3 love the burrito bowls ! everything us made fresh
3 everything from the steak to even the water was tasty !
1 the food here was ok . could be better for an authentic place .
2 love the atmosphere and how trendy <unk> place is , reminds me of <unk> kinda , the way they have it set up . i had <unk> ny strip steak and i don not think it was worth the price . the steak did not come with a side .
4 love this mall ! one of my favorite malls in az . .
0 local <unk> , bad food , slow service . 2 thumbs down
4 well , my 1st time and wow ! got 3 legs -lrb- drums -rrb- and 2 <unk> -lrb- huge buttered up <unk> ! yum ! -rrb- the hot sauce to go with it almost made the chicken taste like big wings ... should 've busted out the blue cheese dressing
4 on my way to yelp glory ! : -rrb- so i 'm really starting to like this place . with the weather cooling off their patio is really cozy and they have a live acoustic band out there to set the mood . really chill . <unk> there is a
2 i 've been many times to this place and it can be hit or miss , through no fault of tommy b 's . this place could be a great scene but it definitely seems to bring in the older crowd ... 60 plus . great patio and the food
4 this place is absolutely amazing ! huge place with tons of activities and very classy . they have a cool pool area and water slides and even <unk> rides on the water with singers ! sat in bar area and listened great live band , which they have pretty much
0 not a fan of this location , i do think it 's great they have boca burgers though . i generally thing <unk> are great , and employees are nice but this one the employees are always so unpleasant . and the food is simply not as good as the
4 enjoyed blu burger for the first time today . service in one word was amazing ! have n't had such wonderful service in years ! food was fantastic , they were down one cook so it was a little slower so they brought us out some french fries to hold
0 i actually worked at this location in high school . it 's even where i met my husband -lrb- we worked there together -rrb- . we went back over the weekend to see <unk> of march -lrb- which is great by the way -rrb- and were so disappointed to see
4 i 've been to this location several times and i 've never had anything but a great experience . service and food is always fantastic . check out happy hour , you can get some fantastic drink and food specials . last night we went for happy hour before heading
1 i 've gone here twice now because of a groupon . but i have to say , i 'm not impressed . both times the server was n't very friendly and the drinks were expensive and not well made .
3 i only go for the movies or when i know what i 'm getting . not much of a shopper but i remember having fun here when i still lived in l.a. and came to visit .
4 i wo n't lie ... i saw this restaurant featured on man vs food and had absolutely zero desire to eat here . the sight of the food did not look appetizing to me . omg was i wrong ! i went here to celebrate a co-worker 's promotion and
2 delicious beers and good food . i 've only been twice and very surprisingly , this place never seems to get very busy - at least inside . they let you bring your dog as long as you stay at the back bar . i <unk> outside the first time
3 everything tastes delicious , i ca n't deny this . it 's expensive for a lunch though ... i do n't think i have left without spending at least $ 12-15 but i guess it 's to be expected in scottsdale quarter ! i 've always gone during weekday lunch
3 i just got done eating dinner there , and i had to hurry to my computer and write a review . what a cool neighborhood bar kinda place -- with pool -- and food ! good food , at that . well , i can only vouch for the burgers
3 if the biggest coffee geek on the planet had a basement to himself , this is what he would create -- a lab , indeed . the coffee experts can get their rocks off on all the high tech brewing equipment , and the <unk> coffee , and food pairings
3 in my eyes , china chan is completely redeemed . apparently , i suck at picking dim sum dishes - except for the last time . i ordered the fried taro , the baked bbq beef buns , and the chinese broccoli . the fried taro were fluffy , crispy
4 at last , a sushi bar that is n't a hot spot , and is n't completely devoid of atmosphere . it is the perfect balance -- clean , but comfortable , sophisticated , yet friendly . what 's more , the food is excellent . i have been there
4 you know the scene in the original <unk> wonka , where he finally takes the kids into the chocolate room and the looks on their faces as if they 've gone to heaven as he tells them ` hold your breath , make a wish , count to three ...
4 mmm dirty hipster bars . let me count the ways in which i love you . you are cheap -lrb- we had $ 2 <unk> -rrb- you are interesting -lrb- local art on the walls that i 'm told changes regularly -rrb- you are full of pretension -lrb- people watching
3 the tavern on mill is my kind of low rent . we stopped by on a sunday afternoon , as this <unk> was looking for a place to watch an obscure basketball game . you could still smell the stale beer from the night before and the staff was doing
4 here 's the thing i loathe about the southwest - you 're too spread out . you have no need to build up so you just build out . this means you are constantly in your car . for 20 minutes at a time . this is especially a problem
0 hated it !!! i had a pasta dish and had to pay an extra $ 4 bucks for 2 tiny shrimp . my husband had a burger , which i swear would have been on the kids menu anywhere else , because it was so tiny . our server had
4 my husband and i love this place . it is so close to where we live , that when we decide last minute that we do n't want to cook , we more than likely call babbo for carryout . it is best on mondays and tuesdays because they have
3 i have heard so many good things about la grande orange and having this be a yelp event , finally gave me a reason to go . i loved the gelato . the chocolate was my favorite . i also tried the red velvet cupcake and a cinnamon roll .
3 the lodge is a pretty low key place . it 's great to go there to just hang out with friends . there 's a pool table and darts in the back and if you go outside you can play bags -lrb- ie . cornhole -rrb- . it does n't
3 my coworkers and i always have a great time here . we just went out yesterday for lunch and the service was very good . i had a grilled chicken salad , which was okay . my coworkers all loved their food , which all looked much better than my
2 was n't what i thought it would be ? i ordered the beach house but <unk> in chicken instead of the burger . maybe this was the problem ? the chicken was not a breast , but instead it was diced and made the sandwich tremendously difficult to eat .
3 my husband and i came in on a monday night because we saw they have a $ 5 charr burger special . its hard to beat that price , so we thought we 'd give it a shot . i 'm glad we did ! we both got the charr
3 i love shopping here ! for the most part , the produce is wonderful and fresh . my only complaint in that area is the berries ... sometimes they can be a bit moldy , but the last few times a fresh batch of strawberries or blueberries has been brought
3 indulge burgers got a few things right and a few things wrong , but overall , i was very pleased with my experience . we had a living social deal , and got the sweet potato and regular fries combo , as well as a side salad to start .
4 i always make the mistake of bringing only one bag in with me , and then i end up buying 3 bags worth of groceries !! i could just walk up and down the aisles , filling my cart with every other thing i see . they have so many
4 while i was waiting for my order , this guy next in line kept asking the girl at the counter `` this is the real shit , right ? it 's the real shit ? '' well yeah , at chicago gyros it definitely is . i live a few
2 the company i work for booked the melting pot for our holiday party this year , and we all had a great time . i am rating it 3 stars because although i did n't have to pay , i think the value may be questionable for what you get
4 yeah , that 's right , count 'em : five stars . chino deserves it , it 's what your father wants for you , anyone who does n't agree is a goddamn hater and you do n't need them in your life , etc. . do people hear ``
3 my date and i started in the basement which was super cozy . while waiting , we were distracted by the amazing aroma of food surrounding us from other tables . once we sat down , we could not make a decision about what to order -- everything looked so
3 love love love . first of all , i loved the atmosphere of this place . it was warm and comfortable feeling , almost like you were in someones house , if that makes sense ? we went on the first night it was open again for summer and i
3 my first experience with richardson 's was actually at the rokerij . when i finally got to eat in their newly redone restaurant i became a fan for life . my boyfriend and i decided to try to get in last minute on a saturday night , which in hindsight
3 crescent ballroom is the first venue i can think of in phoenix that is actually a cool place to watch live music , and eat a satisfying meal . i was intrigued when i heard it was another place to watch a good show , but it definitely became a
4 we waited for about an hour for a table . it was well worth the wait ! the pizza and calzone were amazing . maria was a fantastic server ! we will definitely be back and bring others with us !
2 not sure about all the hype . this place had mediocre food and mediocre service . no wow factor , but it does have a nice open air atmosphere .
4 this is my favorite restaurant . when we visit az , i will go back for another visit .
4 thank you so much <unk> !!! our friends enjoy lucky strike and wanted to have a little get together for a birthday . the group consisted of more than 15 people . the two lanes were more than enough for all of us . there was a great seating area
4 the girls were awesome !!! they know how to share the love ! and the coffee is great !
4 of course a 5 star ! i have my <unk> i know i can always run into and share some killer mac n cheese with and a bottle of chambord ! love this place !
4 <unk> <unk> . learn it . order it . love it . it 's <unk> soup . i do n't care if you do n't like seafood , you will love this . you might think it 's just sauce that the mussels are served in . it 's soup
0 having met some of the owners before it opened , i really wanted to love this place . the location is perfect , the concept is fun , the atmosphere is exciting , and the decor is wonderful . but now that the head chef has gone back to the
1 med fresh has all the ambience of a take-out place , but without the cheap prices or speed . for $ 10 , the chicken was dry , lukewarm , and boring , the hummus was grainy , and the rice was sad . this might have been because i
0 i agree with everything that max a. said about this place . i went in here not too long ago as some friends really wanted to go for last call . if you are turned on by watching some pale <unk> looking girl wearing a gas mask dance on a

3 i have gone here several times and have tried the pizza , subs and the calzones . i have not had anything there that i did not like and the only reason i do n't give this five stars is because everytime i am in there it seems a large
3 i wanted to wait to review casey 's until i actually sat down and ate a meal there . i go to casey 's pretty often on the weekend nights to enjoy some libations but i had not actually ate any of the food . i went today to have
4 this is the socially awkward and shy person 's dream come true . self serve yogurt and toppings with limited interaction with people . i am one of those shy folks and i love that i can go get some delicious blueberry tart yogurt , add some vanilla wafer yogurt
4 i really enjoyed the lunch i had at the orange table , and the service was actually quite attentive . the menu has a large variety of sandwiches , burgers and salads . there are additional items available for dinner but i can imagine it is tough to get a
1 food was good , service was lousy . started out with <unk> and gyoza . both were good . had a mix of nigiri -lrb- yellowtail , tuna , salmon , and eel -rrb- plus some rolls . all were good . alas , food is only half the battle
1 lame at best ... no bark on the pork sandwich and cornbread smothered in a pound of butter . i would not go back and would advise others to look elsewhere . much better options are out there . .
2 was around the metro center area and looking for some italian food for dinner . found this place on yelp . reminds me of a small family joint . all the standards are covered . the wings were good , the pasta -lrb- broccoli & chicken with alfredo -rrb- was
3 who is up for cambodian food ? well , apparently , it was me and a couple of friends . here comes the two <unk> : first - the location - it is actually a bit difficult to find . north side of indian school between 12th st. and 16th
2 hmm . really struggling to decide what to rate this place . that said , here are the highlights . the building is really cool . open concept with wood , tile , and brick . the beer selection is large and rotates during the night . crowd as good
4 an excellent choice for breakfast in the valley . we stopped in for breakfast on father 's day . we opted to share the chicken in the coop and breakfast enchiladas . both of savory options topped with eggs . really like both of them . they are very large
2 que <unk> , <unk> ... this is the second time i have eaten at ticoz . first experience was better then the second . stopped on for lunch on a lazy day of holiday vacation . the place was sparsely populated . i had the cuban sandwich -lrb- wheat bread
2 my husband and i went here once and loved it . he had a burger -lrb- i ca n't remember what kind -rrb- and loved it while i had the grilled cheese and found it incredibly gooey and delicious . we also had the parmesan garlic chips and fries and
1 i absolutely love the blanco 's in north tucson . the food is fabulous , the views are incredible and the service is impeccable . the scottsdale location is not so great . my husband and i went here for an early dinner one night and we waited for a
3 i loved the restaurant itself but honestly i was not completely impressed with the food . i like city hall better for steak but prefer the staff at ruth 's chris . my husband and i both had the filet and garlic mashed potatoes and both were just ok .
1 the problem with this place is that they hyped it as `` the owners of az88 ... '' yadda yadda yadda . well , if you 're going to reference az88 , they you better have great drinks and -lrb- at least -rrb- good bar food . this place has
3 i actually had a really good breakfast here . i had the monkey cakes , which were really really good . the atmosphere was funky diner meets casual coffee shop . a little on the pricey side ... i think anything over $ 12 total per person for breakfast is
4 friday night happy hour is by far one of the best happy hours in phoenix . it 's 3-7pm and the prices for <unk> , tempura and cocktails are awesome . it 's definitely a people-watching place ... as the crowd seems to change from week to week . the
4 had the salmon & tuna sushi and is was amazing . some of the best sushi i 've had in the valley . the sushi was generous , and very fresh -lrb- ca n't really ask for much more at a sushi place -rrb- . the also seem to have
2 arrived around 5pm one wednesday evening . the place is not in a nice area of phoenix , and it looked deserted , and i was going to leave , when i saw a mercedes and <unk> pull up . so i thought i 'd give it a chance .
2 if you have out of town guests visiting , they might enjoy stopping by the sugar bowl for a dessert after eating in old town . this place is your classic old school ice cream shop . the sundaes were large enough to split . get the brownie buster ...
3 awesome gelato , awesome location , friendly employees . i would highly recommend the salted caramel flavor . my only gripe is the price ! around $ 4 for a single scoop , which is quite modest in size compared to some other places . but now that i know
0 warning ! do not take your clothes here !! i read some of their bad yelp reviews beforehand and now i 'm kicking myself in the ass that i did n't listen . they managed to destroy three of the five <unk> i dropped off ... i 'm talking like

2 i have been to rokerij three times . the first was for a work related lunch - i enjoyed the small plate selection and was impressed by the ambiance . i enjoyed it enough to take my bf back there for a romantic dinner . it took us a while
4 wonderful wood fired pizza . the <unk> mushrooms are wonderful on the sausage pizza . this little hole in the wall pizza joint is worth searching for , just east of handlebar j 's . they even have a <unk> wood fire pizza oven for catering .
3 great bagels , and have been around for a long time . same owners , and consistent good food .
1 grilled chicken cesar not up to par as in the past . croutons were burnt and chicken was dry .
3 great place to relax with a good glass of wine .
4 early on a hot saturday morning , we headed to baker nursery to find new plants for our landscaping adventure . what a lovely nursery ! it was well organized with plenty of shade so you did n't have to wander the aisles with the sun blazing down . all
3 we went on christmas day to see the girl with the dragon tattoo . i loved that we could order and choose our seats on line , even the type of theater , as it was showing on two screens . this is my first experience at one of the

1 maybe i am just getting <unk> with each review and less generous with my stars , but i am trying to figure out why the previous reviewers raved so much about culinary dropout . there are certainly things to love ... the expansive outdoor patio with some of the most
4 with all the hype , i was so hesitant to even go within a mile of dominick 's until a girlfriend from the east coast here on a <unk> trip made it there before me ! glad that i had a real foodie give me her honest opinion before i
3 this was our second time to roka akor and it was just a great as the first . i do n't know why we waited so long to go back ... maybe because it is a little further from home than some of our other <unk> hangouts . we went
3 tonto bar & grill is tops on our list ! we took out-of-town friends for dinner since they wanted to see what restaurants are in our `` backyard '' . tonto bar & grill did us proud once again . we were seated promptly in the fireplace room which is
4 my new favorite place to eat breakfast ! despite the parking lot being packed , we were seated right away , served great food , the man was able to watch some football , and i had plenty of people watching to do . finally , a flexible menu ,
4 i love this place . it 's not just all college kids . there are plenty of people in their 30s and upward that come here to enjoy the brewery , and food . i love it because it 's big , lots of seating , water <unk> for outside
3 on a more positive note , here is one club i do enjoy . now , i used to go all the time when i was single and only been once since the remodel , but i dig the set up -lrb- spacious rooms , 4 bars , a designated

3 this place is awesome ! i had a hard time finding this place due to the trees covering its entrance , but it was worth it ! the service was friendly . they had free wifi , but they have very limited outlets for laptop chargers . you can also
2 i find myself here about once a week . the pho is yummy . the spring rolls are good too . the service is friendly and prompt . when i want a more upscale pho experience , i come to this place . parking can be a nightmare , and
4 love this hidden little local bar . really great selection of beers and specialty cocktails . interesting mix of sophisticated clientele . if you 're looking to get a little dressed up to go out , you wo n't feel out of place here at all . they play funky
3 only recently getting into the arizona sports scene . i 've been here for a few coyote 's games this season . love this place ! i wish there was a little more variety in the concessions , but that 's my only gripe . the way that it 's
3 america 's taco shop knows how to make some darn good carne asada . you ca n't go wrong here if you order anything with carne asada . they recently started offering chicken too . the bean and cheese burrito is delicious if you 're looking for a meatless option
2 we frequent this location often on tuesdays because kids eat free which is wonderful . they also have $ 1 domestic beers which we appreciate with our meal choices . the food is always abundant and clean . the wait staff is the only downfall of this location and the
3 we went for their late happy hour and had their amazing pulled pork sliders with sweet potatoe fries . they were delicious . i ordered a glass of wine and did not like it but the waitress easily gave me another selection and was totally fine with it , super

4 maybe it was the time that i caught this place but the less people the better for me . i just visited for the first time last night and i 'm hooked . for the off cue nights where i want to snack on some brats and beer sold !!!!
3 i like to think of green as the fast food for the <unk> challenged . whether you 're allergic to something , ca n't tolerate the taste of a particular item , curious of the spectrum of the v 's world , drop by this hidden niche . it 's
2 i 've been to this location several times but i 'd rather be more positive than <unk> . the service has always been a bit slow and less informative . i 've come in and on several occasions lost out on the specials till the very end when the server
4 food and service were amazing . we had the <unk> and brussel sprout flat bread and the smoked salmon scramble . service was right on with the <unk> and <unk> that we had everything we needed without bothering our conversation or meal . i love the decor and open feel
4 how does one write a review for an institution like trader joe 's ? i feel like everything has been said already -- but i 'll try to give you a fresh perspective . this is somewhere you can go for your staples and for exotic things to spice up
3 simply amazing ! $ 4.00 <unk> draft beers and delicious desserts rounded out an absolutely fantastic meal . we had shrimp ceviche . shrimp and fish tacos , and the shrimp <unk> . the shrimp ceviche had delicious spices , wonderful chunks of delicious goodness , and was definitely a
2 good food , nice decor . there 's really nothing wrong with wildflower that keeps it from 4 stars except the feeling that a good , but not orgasmic , take-out sandwich and 1/3 cup of potato salad -lrb- exactly 1/3 of a cup -rrb- should not cost $ 8.50
2 i 'm sad to say that the last few times we 've gone to `` the wood '' we 've been disappointed . the service has slipped to a level that none of us are willing to accept , and the attitude there seems to be <unk> an over 50
3 i read the reviews of pho thanh quite a while ago , and ended up bookmarking it for later . well , here it is . later : 3 people with big appetites <unk> on pho thanh today . it was totally and completely packed -- wall to wall people
3 went here for a work lunch with some coworkers last week and we had a good time with fast service and a friendly waitress . we were quickly seated outside -lrb- which we requested -rrb- and our drink orders were taken right away . after about a five minute wait
3 wanted to follow up / expand on my initial review to say that we love the food at tom 's - the bbq is delish and it 's definitely an easy stop off to grab a bite . they have a really large selection of food items , both at
2 we had a groupon for this spot and decided to give it a try since we love greek food and it 's not too far from our place . when we walked in we were greeted pretty quickly and asked to sit outside , even though it was a bit
4 hidden inside of several other office building , this location can be easily overlooked . however , it was obvious from the number of cars at 6 p.m. on a weekday , that this place is a local hot spot despite its hidden venue . there was a visible line
3 we gave this place a try based on a friend referring us here for a date night . it has a fun feel to it considering the back door entrance and <unk> `` <unk> '' feel , at least it 's something outside the norm ! we arrived a touch
3 we were greeted as we entered , and sat immediately . the waitress was nice enough to explain to my fiancee how this restaurant works - 1 . -rrb- order off of the menu , 2 . -rrb- pick what you want in your bowl of a listed menu and
1 my wife likes this place and that 's why i 've been several times . since i ca n't complain to her i 'll complain to you ! each time i come here i hope maybe this is the time the food wows me . <unk> : it does n't
3 obviously the reputation <unk> itself . the restaurant earned that reputation though . the pizza is fantastic . with their being open for lunch now and adding a second location , you can actually get one of those pizzas in less than 3 hours too , which is a bonus
3 i enjoy <unk> . it 's a dive but it 's a comfortable dive . the food is decent , the live music is always enjoyable , and the daily specials are a staple . the happy hour is 3-7 daily and there are reverse specials as well .
4 best ice cream in town , the kitchen sink sundae was phenomenal . the staff is so energetic and have so much pride in their products . be careful as this place is habit forming ! : -rrb-
3 johnny cakes w prickly pear syrup , damn good .
4 it a hipster place for sure , but all types are welcome . i think it is the best coffee in town and a great place 's to hang out with friends . and lets not kid ourselves , all the people on their computers are not working nor are
3 like pavlov 's dogs , my husband and i headed over to miu 's after we read the review in the new times . as many have said , the place is in an iffy neighborhood but that never <unk> people like us and obviously other yelpers either . we
1 ate here after looking at all the choices in the mekong plaza . tried their combination menu which included egg drop soup , spring roll , fried nice and the the dish of your choice . the soups came out and after two <unk> i decided it was not worth
1 just got back from eating at asian cafe express . i went there strictly based on yelp reviews . here is my assessment : portions = 5 stars pricing = 5 stars <unk> = 4 stars food taste = 2 based on the above , they deserve 4 stars all
3 i have purchased many sandwiches from this capriotti 's location , specifically , i love the italian combo . i am writing to apologize to capriotti 's for my <unk> . today i was on <unk> street and bell shopping at harbor <unk> with my husband and saw a place

3 so good ! i had the chicken alfredo pasty and boyfriend had the bangers and mash . i 'll never eat a hot pocket again ! happy hour is only 3-5 , so get there early and enjoy a dollar off beers -lrb- not sure if this is drafts and/or
3 the short version : good sushi , decent prices , decent service , decent atmosphere . of all of the sushi places in tempe to visit , this is the best to go to with a group , as we often do . compared to some other choices -lrb- <unk>
3 after a long weekend of work , this was a nice way to finish it all off . i ordered a <unk> porterhouse , ceaser salad and we all got the family style au gratin <unk> and mac and cheese . lets start with the bread that was offered up
3 how weird is that . i think <unk> b. may of been sitting at the table over from us during lunch ! the rolls have improved since my last visit . they were no longer greasy , hopefully last time was a fluke . the pho was awesome . i

4 so , i debated long and hard about whether i should write this review . though i am so much in love with the place that i would gladly give it 10 stars if i could , i also do n't want it to become one of those popular places
1 totally average experience , the only saving grace was the soup . the buffet had a bunch of wilted lettuce with soggy croutons when we went there for dinner . they did have croutons separately towards the end of the counter , so i did n't understand why they had
4 go suns ! us airways has always been a fantastic venue . i have seen concerts and suns games here . on my most recent visit i attended the <unk> <unk> this particular trip the tickets we had <unk> us to eat/drink in blue moon lounge which was fun .
2 this used to be my favorite whole foods in the valley a couple of years back and had i reviewed it say 4 years <unk> would have definitely given it 5 stars . they did a major <unk> of employees and it just has n't been the same . nothing
4 four of us came here saturday late afternoon to enjoy the downstairs patio and the steel drums . we had a great time and the weather was fantastic . our server , ben , took great care of us . this was my second time visiting tommy bahamas . on

2 after hearing all the raves and rants from our asian friends , i checked out the mekong plaza today , and of course had to start tasting every single restaurant on that premise . unphogettable was our first choice , because bf wanted pho . he got pho with raw

3 while in tempe decided to get some chinese food . after searching yelp we decided to go to china king . the restaurant has a wedding reception feel to it . we ordered shrimp fried rice , the beef in french sauce , scallops in xo sauce and my wide
2 average mexican restuarant which has a lot of retired clients due to specials -lrb- buy one get one free -rrb- type . place is always packed but not because of the food at least for me . i had their <unk> and they only make them in red sauce .
2 generic lucky strike atmosphere . nice crowd .
4 this place is amazing . the service is always top notch , it 's the kind where they get to know you fast and have your coffee -lrb- or ice coffee -rrb- ready by the time you pull up to the window . great for all sorts of coffee with
2 felt old , loved the smell of the place . great artwork on the walls . good business . it was hidden behind stores that faced the main street , thanks gps . the coffee was great . and not overpriced . good coffee places are always something to look
3 yeah ! the yucca is the ultimate in local dive bars . !! shuffleboard , cheap drinks , local flavor , and no need for a jukebox . no cover , every night , live music ! come one , come all !!
4 there is none better . this taco shop is off the beaten path hidden and mixed in next to a smoke shop and behind a circle k. parking can be at a premium but the <unk> is the food . great friendly service , low key on the inside and
3 really good and cheap mexican food fast ! love their enchiladas , green chile burritos and tamales ... all for under $ 5 each ! their salsa is hot and their tortillas are homemade and so yummy ! and although i love the <unk> location , this one is much
2 i tried hippie 's with 2 of my coworkers today and thought it was pretty good . first , for $ 1.50 a taco , you ca n't beat it as each of them weighs about a pound each ! i tried a pork and a daily special of green
3 the bf and i stopped in for a late lunch on saturday as this has been on our long list of new places to try . we were immediately impressed by the eclectic decor with a great mix of contemporary , southwest and classic styles . i love the lighted
3 i really enjoyed this place . the service is great and the pizza is very , very good . our server was friendly , courteous and checked on us at all the right times . i would say the price range is average . it 's a super casual place
3 we walked in past nine in the evening and the manager , jim , was excited to see two new patrons . he had us try some samples of the horchata and this mint lime drink . everything was fresh and made from scratch each day . he was very
2 i have been to this place about three times over the last couple years . i always loved the blueberry pancakes each time i went , but i was disappointed this time around . the food was just okay . the waiter was very friendly and kept up with our
2 the boyfriend raved -lrb- and apparently the restaurant itself raves -rrb- about its famous protein pancakes , so , of course , we had to go ! we went around 11:30 am on a monday morning it was a long weekend -rrb- and they place was less than half full

3 this is a regular spot <unk> go to with friends . we always sit in the bar area which is very much separated from the restaurant area . it 's nice because come game day and your favorite team is losing you do n't have to worry about kids hearing
1 the pesto was lacking flavor . i was really hoping they would live up to their name , but highly disappointed . their pasta was good though as well as their pie .
3 seems reviews are on 2 sides . we got groupon that included ticket and a soda . the regular prices are same as most cinemas . the extra here is what you can drink -lrb- alcohol -rrb- or eat -lrb- bar food -rrb- . for the ticket price and the
3 stopped there for breakfast . a cozy little place , with very friendly and smiling persons . their house coffee is fine , but will have to go back for a dirty chai . i had also a bagel -lrb- just like any other -rrb- . a nice drive through
2 i just stopped for a `` wurst '' and that 's what i had . plain and simple . maybe i 'm spoiled by ted 's ... but this was just ok to calm the noon <unk> . being inside asu campus , there are not many offers , so
3 1st make reservations or you 'll be disappointed . their menu offers a wide variety of yummy stuff ! as it was hard to chose just one , i was lucky to be in a group . their omelets are just great ! i had the mediterranean , but also
4 great selection and goooood flavor . this place is a cozy spot to try and enjoy a good gelato . i tend to have the chocolate flavors , and they had at least 3 different kinds . you wo n't believe this place has something sweet for you , so
3 we went with other cs in our culinary tour . they were kind to sit all of us -lrb- more than 20 persons -rrb- . good service , and the ladies were patient to take our order . we had the party trays , which says it is for 3
3 so far , this could be considered the best fried chicken i 've tried in us . now if you have a small stomach , order something with one piece ... or you 'll face a lot of food . the idea of mixing a waffle with your chicken is
3 this place is always crowded as many work or just waste <unk> using fb here . you might have trouble finding a space to sit , enjoy their coffee or tea and talk . decoration makes it very comfortable and the barista that day was a star ! my friend
3 one of the few places in the valley to check independent and some foreign movies . they always have some festivals or special presentations going on . it is not large enough for my movie demand , but is ok for being part of big franchise .
3 this is one of the first places i had brunch in az when i arrived 3 years ago . i remember the menu was different , so i had some healthy something with blue berries . but i tried what some friends ordered and all had good flavors . will
3 i 'll have to try one more time this place . on a weird week where i was having cravings for noodles this came perfect ! noodles are made in your face !! very affordable and tasty . plus it is in my favorite asian corner , where lee lee
4 for somebody who likes to try `` weird '' things , this is the perfect place . i even found white big corn -lrb- from peru -rrb- !!! i would buy more of their fresh vegetables , but i have to write down the names and find out some recipes
1 do n't bother . it might be in the `` exclusive '' area , but the service , drinks do n't match the location . i came here for an 80 's party and only one bar was working ... with one person . so the guy handled better with
2 if the place is going to host annoying <unk> fans , they should put a warning . i came here with two visitors from europe and we were almost not allowed to have a conversation at a bar just because there was a small group of die hard fans of
3 i 've been to these place more than 3 times during the art walks , never had a clue about the name . i would just enjoy the beer selection . recently a friend took me there on a week day ... nice change !! without so many people it
3 best thing for me ? <unk> ! this place is like having our own private movie theater ! i go often with my bf sundays -lrb- first show -rrb- or wednesdays and we enjoy the space and <unk> of this place . not the crowded and annoying of the posh
0 ok ... it 's father 's day ... and dad get to choose the restaurant ... yeah ... not really ... no one liked my choices ... with that said ... the family agreed on romano 's macaroni grill ... have n't been here in a couple of years ...
3 heard about this restaurant from a friend and decided to take a co-worker who is relocating to another office out of town . and i am glad i chose this place . the service was a little slow out of the gate , hence the 4 star rating , but
3 i will premise this review by noting that there were only 2 other people in the place when i arrived . and that is the only reason that i did not give it 5 stars , becasue i would like to see how everything is when they are busier .
3 this place rocks . awesome tacos and a variety of meats to choose from . very affordable . the owner is very nice , everything is excellent .
3 solid four stars . very nice array of lines to climb , open , friendly , spacious . though i considered giving this a 3 because their <unk> area leaves a lot to be desired , small , cramped , short , and just overall not very good . but
2 really like this restaurant . i 've only been once , so i ca n't tell if its because i loved the feel of it or for the food . the pasta was homemade and i remember it feeling a little heavy and <unk> , but overall a nice date
1 this place is so overrated . everyone always raves about the authenticity of this restaurant and that its a phoenix gem - far from it . i 'm okay with the orange vinyl seats and the 70s vibe - no problem , you do n't have to be fancy to
3 during the spring and fall in phoenix , i 'm a huge fan of olive & ivy . you ca n't beat their patio - its first come , first served on huge , comfortable furniture along with fire pits . the areas are nicely divided and its absolutely perfect
3 i really , really , really like switch . in fact , i 'd give it a 4.5 if i could . my only wish is that the patio was a little more comfortable but the inside makes up for it . i prefer switch for lunch over dinner but
3 okay , so if you 're looking for a real sports bar in arcadia you 've found it . it 's totally a man 's bar and one of those places you feel silly ordering a martini or glass of wine but that 's what is great about it .
4 the best margarita pizza in town - and we know our pizza . the perfect flavor . great restaurant with a simple menu and good atmosphere . fantastic chicken wings , salads and margarita pizza . the sangria is pretty good too . usually a bit of a wait ,
3 i 'm on the constant hunt for good chinese food in phoenix . after many disappointing meals , i found desert jade and have n't looked back . the restaurant is super clean and quaint inside -lrb- even a big fireplace -rrb- and the service is great . each of
2 if you 're looking for a <unk> , fast casual lunch spot , zoes is your spot . it 's easy and great for a work week lunch . it 's nothing that exciting from an ambiance perspective but the food is good -lrb- not great -rrb- , it does
3 probably , my favorite place to run errands . the essentials : <unk> , eggs , bread , naked juice , bottled water , pb & j , aluminum foil , shampoo , lotion , contact <unk> . besides that , i always enjoy the food samples that i try

3 solid , solid , solid chinese ! period . if you are looking for authentic or close to -- low and behold , the great wall ! if you do n't believe me , come here on the weekends between 10am and 12pm . the sheer number of folks trying
1 food : mediocre , menu is pretty extensive for a small chinese joint , basic lunch menu for under $ 6 . i typically come here with my co-workers and we do it family style . service : mediocre , not too much too complain about , generally nice when
3 if there 's a place in old town that you can rely on for quality in food and service , this is the place . you get what you paid for . based on my last few visits , it seems to always be busy , which as you know
3 first off , was here one time on a friday evening and noticeably , the patrons are not your typical scottsdale social lite , was more like your tempe college crowd . but that 's ok , i came for the food ! so this place is not too bad
3 this is a pretty hip , trendy venue situated around the kierland area . the decor inside and out is very upscale and modern , similar to many places around scottsdale . the square <unk> of this place is very roomy , even on a good night with some outside
3 i 'm going to cut to the chase and tell you the belgian waffle was outstanding ! you are probably thinking , why i got waffles at a pancake joint , right ? to be honest , i was going to order pancakes but judging how they looked from other
3 salty sow ? what the heck is a salty sow ? apparently -lrb- after looking it up -rrb- , it 's an adult female pig . ohhh , makes sense . their specialty is in pork . which i regrettably did not order but will next time . what appealed
4 i really , really adore this hidden , atypical scottsdale scene . i like how it is secluded and away from the busy part of old town ! the sign is not that well lighted , so it 's kind of hard to find if you drove by it .
3 first , in the interest of full disclosure , i used to work here , and i loved it -- the people i worked with were knowledgeable and friendly , we put on fantastic events , we sold a whole wide variety of independent novels -lrb- check out the <unk>
3 why all the hate ? america 's taco is right across the street from my <unk> , they serve up cheap amazing bean and cheese burritos , and they have amazing creamy guacamole . what could make it better ? sweet <unk> horchata . it 's so <unk> that it
3 i know this is supposed to be a sweet shop , but i swear , the <unk> here are adorable . measuring cups shaped like russian <unk> dolls ? ice cube trays shaped liked strawberries ? be still my heart ! but what really sold me was the <unk> .
3 this is always on my list of spots to visit when i 'm in arizona . their bruschettas are amazing and their cheese plates are <unk> <unk> and tasty . also , they have great deals on wednesdays if you become a fan of them on facebook . the waitstaff
2 so i have been here twice . first time was on a first friday night , it was crowded . food was good , i had ordered the eggplant <unk> tower , which was huge . delicious and my two other friends were pleased with their dinners . i decided

1 this place is so confusing even yelpers ca n't figure out where to place a review for it ... <unk> you enter and i 'm still trying to figure out if you have to order at the counter and then if you want to order more from the high <unk>

4 when i mention lo-lo 's chicken and waffles to the uninitiated , i often get a reaction that chicken and waffles is an unusual combination . from a culinary point of view , chefs continually <unk> for balance . with lo-lo 's you get balance between savory fried chicken and
1 meh . the `` signature '' lamb shank was <unk> and the adobo was incredibly sour . the server never inquired about the <unk> entree . the $ 11 margarita was meh . the crab and mango salad was good . not sure the food and service live up to
3 china chili is the restaurant that orange chicken built . while that dish is tasty , this place has so much more to offer . venture away from the lure of the orange chicken tractor <unk> and try such tasty morsels as : boiled won tons -- a standout dish
2 great breakfasts if you stick to their strengths -- bagels , challah , potato pancakes , lox , etc. . the breakfast sliders are fantastic , and my wife is a huge fan of the breakfast tapas . skip the skillets , scrambles -lrb- with the possible exception of the
3 thrilled postino made it to gilbert , but i prefer the vibe in arcadia , where they 've really managed to capture the spirit of a european wine bar -- you know , without kids running all over the place . the `` family friendly '' atmosphere in gilbert fits
4 pho is magic . it cures everything , and we head to pho van whenever there 's even a hint of a cold coming on . ok , we go even when we feel fine . no matter how hot it is outside . pho van 's broth is so
2 been here a few times , not sure what is up with the servers here . seem very inattentive . different one each time too . weird . anyway , great beer , cheap beer , great happy hour . that 's the only reason i go .
4 i had been searching for a good bbq place -lrb- specifically a place with good pulled pork -rrb- and look no further . this place has lots of options , great sides -lrb- i got the waffle fries and pasta salad -rrb- and excellent sauce ! the pulled pork sandwich
1 i mean , i knew what i was getting in to ... and i had even heard from others to pass on this place . but i decided to give it a try anyway . now , i 'm hardly a sushi snob , but honestly this is pretty easily
2 too much hype about this place , really . the menu is creative and it has a good concept but i think they are resting on their laurels . we had the orange fennel salad and the margarita pizza . the salad was fresh and heavily dressed , good stuff
3 admittedly , i did not eat here . i did come for two nights during the phx <unk> and loved every minute of it . this is like a hybrid dive bar and artsy hangout , being from detroit , i felt right at home . the <unk> of the
3 living within walking distance of the <unk> has been a great help to getting me around tempe and phoenix , and because it connects to the airport , around the world . the <unk> is an excellent way for tourists to see the city , allowing them to travel through
3 good music venues need to be divided into their parts . there are places to see good music , and good venues . for tempe , there is not really any place that combines both , sad to say it . yucca has great music , but the stage is

4 anytime i am in the area i stop here for a boba tea . love the atmosphere and the drinks . i highly recommend this place .

3 as a big fans of northern thai food , we were excited to try this place . the food was great and they even have sticky rice . everyone there was friendly and service was quick . the decor is definitely different , but the large tables actually proved useful
4 amazing ! i had no idea this even existed . what rock was i living under when i lived in phoenix for 3 years ? i mean , my gawd ! this place is super cool . from the concept and vibe to the menu and coffee ... wowza .
4 it does n't look like much from the outside , considering most theatres are gaudy with bright lights and huge posters . but , shy as it might be in today 's modern entertainment jungle , tempe valley art is a fantastic little place . how can one not like
3 i am giving my seal of approval to the vig for a few simple , straightforward reasons : * $ 3.50 pints during happy hour * decent selection of beer , including stella and <unk> -lrb- mmm -rrb- * <unk> artichoke dip -lrb- which would be that much better if
3 you can pig out here , and they wo n't <unk> . how do i know ? that 's what their t-shirts say . but , if you do n't want to feast on the pig , you have other options , too , like beef , chicken and fish
4 i admit , it 's trendy . it 's popular . it 's closer to americanized sushi than traditional . but it 's damn fantastic . if you need to please a group of picky <unk> , go here . try the caterpillar , tootsie and spicy tuna roll .
4 this place is great ! talk about a divine menu and vino list . their scallops are superb , and their cheese tray - that includes a local honey - is top-notch . the only thing that would make this place beyond stellar , is a few additions of comfy
1 uhm , totally not a place where you can go and relax , unless you 're with a group of friends . there 's just this `` run-down , seedy , <unk> and dangerous '' vibe you get when you approach the ruby room . i 'm no chicken sh

4 take papago park for what it is - a quick getaway in the middle of city life . sure , it 's close to the zoo and botanical gardens . heck , you could make an entire day of it - being outside , roaming , looking at interesting plant
1 for a saturday night , this place had a few select patrons - some even brave enough to sit outside in this absurd august heat . not me . my friend and i parked ourselves at a table in the room with the pool table , where a couple of

4 unpretentious . friendly . inviting . warm decor and soothing music . this is the first local coffee house i found when i moved here a year ago . it was an oasis , a hidden gem in a shopping plaza . my only complaint is that there 's nothing
3 i must admit , i do n't think ethiopian food is my end all , be all . i 've had it twice since moving to phoenix . it 's not that i shy away from eating with my hands . it 's not that i do n't appreciate the
0 what a joke ! whoever recommended this place for happy hour must be smokin ' some serious crack . $ 6 for spinach artichoke dip . guess what ? it 's the same price on the regular menu ! the other choices are only $ 1 off and are mostly
1 gordon biersch has an upstairs outside patio , where you can sit and look down at mill while enjoying food and beer . it 's one of the few accommodations that drew me in - not to mention they have their own beer to sample . i chose the seasonal
2 the lasting impression : -lrb- an update on <unk> -rrb- wow . the chicken salad sandwich on wheat bread is the bomb . i chowed down on this like nobody 's business . and hooray for fresh fruit as my side , with smooth and satisfying coffee . i got
2 ok , so it 's a theatre . another one . yes , attached -lrb- pretty much -rrb- to a huge outdoor mall . sounds like any other harkins in the valley -lrb- minus valley art and camelback 5 , which i both like very much -rrb- . but ,
2 is it the price ? is that what makes this place so darn popular ? it must be , for to some , cheap does equal good . i was expecting more , though , based on the glowing reviews . yes , it 's cheap . my pal and
4 alas ... i 've given up the idea of writing a review for a place if it is n't at least 4 stars . sue me ; i 'm in the industry . fuego bistro is by far one of the best places i 've been to recently . i
4 i feel as though anything i say about postino will just sound like <unk> compliments that a lot of other people have tossed out there ... but i 'm gon na say them anyway ! love the place . the wine selection is fantastic , the servers are friendly ,
3 this is technically my second time coming to st. francis but the first time i only had drinks so i thought i 'd wait until i got the full experience like i did on tuesday . i love the layout & the overall feel of the place . there was
4 the breakfast buzz !!!!!! omg !!!!!!!!! i wish that i could have one of these everyday ! it is a <unk> protein drink with espresso , chocolate , protein powder , banana , peanut butter , milk , vitamins and i think that is it ! my friend introduced this
3 if you want a breakfast place that is delicious and great for the family , great <unk> <unk> date or a great place for a recovery after a long night out this is the place to go ... it used to be at 40th st and indian school but now
4 omg !!! when i heard about this place i had to try it ! i was so excited and it is in a great location right in the heart of old town scottsdale ... i sampled different flavors ... i tried the jack daniels chocolate ... the one with southern
3 i am all about this place ! it has the cutest things and its so warm and inviting inside . they have all the items i love ! they have the cutest bags and shoes and i wish i would afford to shop here all the time . they have
4 i remember this place when it was on shea and it was only open for lunch and they mostly did catering and had weird hours . i would always get the chicken arugula wrap and i could never get enough . then it got popular and then it moved closer
3 first off i love this place ! they have the best happy hour - $ 5 appetizers and you get a choice of like 12 appetizers which is so uncommon . also , there is a drink of the day ! they have a brunch that is to die for
2 this place is solid ... solid ... solid ... plus its right across the street from my job ... the crunchy tacos with chicken , corn salsa , pico de gallo , green salsa , cheese , lettuce and guacamole ... yum yum yum ... i love their salad dressing
4 i love this grocery store ! i wish there was one closer to my house but its okay i have alot of great places in my area too ... anyways i have always loved going here for groceries ... especially for specialty stuff and i think their frozen meals are
4 the food here is perfection ... its fresh and delicious ... the hummus is a great starter and i love the chicken schwarma wrap , beef gyro , pesto chicken pizza and the mediterranean chicken salad !! i go there about once a week and i alternate between those choices
3 four cheese sliders with everything and a medium dr. pepper - and you 're getting out of there for under $ 7 . i will be back many a times to check out everything else they got . i like their style - laid back , short order food and
4 chelsea 's has it going on : atmosphere , food , service ... it 's all right on time . the slow roasting pork that you see as you walk around the side of the restaurant is enticing enough . really makes you think about late night <unk> ... a
2 there 's always a wait here , but you can slip in and out if you have a small party . the coffee is really good , and i 'm a sucker for eggs benedict so i gave it a shot . nothing to write home about but i was
3 i love this theatre because it is for adults only . this makes a simple date night into more of pleasant experience because their are no babies , young kids , crying or screaming ! man ... and they sell angry orchard ! gluten free alcohol sipping boy i was
1 all i can is meh . for the price point , i thinking the food to die for . but i ca n't express how average it was for me . first , the place was deserted , like two other parties in the whole joint . huh ... interesting
1 well ... ya ... the staff was great ! very nice and helpful people . however , this small place crowded store left me wanting more ... more space . haha . they do have some great choices available that are exclusively trader joe 's , but i still prefer
3 the mai tai here is ridiculously good . i 'm not generally a foo foo drink kind of guy but at hula 's i make an exception . for some reason being a girly drink <unk> is totally acceptable to me here . if they had a glass covered in

4 the food ? only if you have to . the bathroom ? only if you have to . so why the five stars ? because it does what it 's supposed to extremely well . the second i walk in i hear `` hey dante '' from the bartender as
3 tried a new place . the prices were nice and the sushi was amazing ! we ordered the california roll , the california crunch roll and the asparagus roll . tried all 3 and have to say the crunch roll was the best . i can not have cucumber so
3 very good food and nice atmosphere . i tried the tenderloin sliders and they were fantastic . my daughter had the kids meal of chicken and fries and she loved the flavor . we also ordered dessert of the chocolate <unk> which had cheesecake bites in it . that was
4 ca n't say enough good things about this place . 100 % the best there is when it comes to gyros . fast service and very fresh . had the normal gyro sandwich with their sauce ... very good . if you want authentic greek food , you will get
4 the mission serves `` modern latin cuisine in a sophisticated yet casual setting '' according to their website . actually , i 'd say the mission serves the best meal in the greater phoenix area with a simple and romantic flair . so much for adjectives , as there may
2 wonderful fried alligator and `` ok shrimp gumbo '' . seems like the bowl has shrunk on the gumbo , or it differs by location . we came here for lunch . the wait on a table was about 30 minutes and the fried alligator came immediately . however ,
4 this was an excellent new find ! thank you , yelp ! the restaurant is beautiful and the service is wonderful . i tried the watermelon salad as a starter . incredible . this was followed by fair trade short ribs with a rub from <unk> of cave creek roasted
1 interesting that this place closed . i tried maria maria in austin and had a great meal . tempe was a different story . so-so food , <unk> service and an odd vibe ... guess they were almost gone .
2 good place to have beer and <unk> . not much in terms of wine and eating here was a stretch . i had an appetizer . <unk> watch : pablo <unk> <unk> -lrb- which take it from 2 stars to 3 -rrb-
0 this is a sketchy collection of crappy stores all piled into one mall . we went to carlos santana 's maria maria 's which was really in a funky place and out of character for this spot ... tons of <unk> chain stores , reminded my of the <unk> -lrb-
2 this is a fun 3.5 star family spot to have an enjoyable dinner . the view is spectacular and the live music is usually good . the food is pretty good , but not up to the ambiance or service . nevertheless , this is an inexpensive meal -lrb- sub
2 this place looks like the old time southwest . there 's even several live <unk> , -lrb- in their cages , of course ! -rrb- . i ordered the trio which was a combination of baby back ribs , steak and chicken with sides and salad . -lrb- a lot
1 barcelona was a great restaurant years ago and had the best paella in scottsdale . today , barcelona is supposed to be a club scene , but in actuality , it 's fairly empty . this place lost its focus and reminds me of <unk> 's in the oc .
3 my second stay here in 2011 was very nice . i enjoy 117 degree scottsdale as there 's no problem getting into good restaurants , minimal traffic and the fairmont is n't sold out ! <unk> lobby lounge was excellent as usual , and i blew off the usual <unk>
3 everything i have had here has been delicious ! the only reason i 'm not giving it a 5 is because i wish it was open later , at least on the weekends .
3 i love coming here for sunday funday and having a pitcher of sangria to share . i 've also been here for dinner and have always had great , fresh food . the service has always been kind , and prompt .
3 i love trying their specials , it 's always pretty delicious ! i also love that they have strongbow , and rogue hazelnut brown , so yum ! service is always kind , and 95 % of the time prompt . they do get busy though so very understandable .
4 i am so grateful this place has opened ! i went to see <unk> here a couple of weeks ago and had such a great time . as someone who often ventures to shows on her own , i felt safe here -lrb- walking in , and walking out -rrb-
3 was in the area and hit this place for lunch today . every thing was very good , especially the nan which was brought to my table fresh and hot . i have eaten here many times before but not lately . some days they have stuff i like better
4 i love this place for brunch on a weekend . i have tried several things from the menu but my favorite is the richardsons combo . the combo adds a pair of enchiladas and asparagus with hollandaise sauce to eggs benedict jalapeno . the eggs benedict jalapeno is totally awesome
4 this place has the best street tacos in central phoenix . i generally come here for lunch and order the tacos but they have lots of other great stuff . they also have a store here where you can get soda , beer , snacks , etc. . they have
4 after reading the reviews i had to try this place so i took a friend today . we had beef and chicken shwarma , <unk> , and 3 pies . everything was really good and very inexpensive . the pita sandwiches are $ 4 and the pies <unk> cents each
4 went back today for breakfast and tried the corned beef hash , it was awesome . it was really great to get good home made corned beef hash . my date tried the pancakes and said they were light , fluffy , and really delicious . this has become one
4 this place is awesome for happy hour . you can get a dozen wings or a taco basket , add a mexican import beer , free chips and salsa plus bean dip . all this for $ 8.50 . you can up the beer to a 32oz for just $
3 this place is great and i eat here often . the food is very good and the prices are great . took a friend and we ordered egg rolls , spring rolls , and two main courses , think it was curry chicken noodle soup and a spicy chicken over
1 i tagged along for breakfast this lovely saturday morning to the breakfast joynt because my friend bought a groupon . the joynt was a bit hard to find , as it is tucked into a shopping center , but my guess as to where it might be ended up being
3 i went to see a double feature -lrb- the hangover ii and <unk> -rrb- last night -lrb- saturday , <unk> with movie starting at <unk> pm -rrb- for $ 6.50 . you can not beat that price anywhere ! i think this place is really great . with the exception
3 it was 11:30 on a tuesday night and i was jonesing for some sweet , fried dough . unfortunately , most places are closed at almost midnight . but not bosa donuts . they have a 24 hr . drive-thru . success ! i am a big fan of bosa
3 my first date at coup des tartes , i ca n't give this restaurant the fifth star because of a few drawbacks . 3.5 star review if i could i have driven by the restaurant many times and thought coup des tartes sounds like a french restaurant , great ,
3 real japanese restaurant here , yasu sushi bistro is at the top of the lists . last time i was here it was small and seemed cramped in . today i <unk> trying to get reservations but now one picks up . <unk> has it yasu is expanding his restaurant
3 <unk> il - mesa flights ! best ever , a flight straight to my home town in northern il . if your from the midwest please support the airlines and if find flights less than major airlines all the time , the only real limitations is the of flights .
2 andy is a great guy , find him any day at two hippies , this restaurant is sure to open more as it builds a reputation . $ 5.00 burger , fries and a drink , this can easily equal success above the other thousands of burger locations in phoenix
3 rositas has grown with the city of phoenix , the first location was originally downtown and the restaurant slowly made its way to just west mcdowell and 24th st. mexican food is taken a serious art in the central phoenix area . rositas is a dominate location that keeps people
3 another great meal at `` my mother 's '' this phoenix location , maybe its the salad buffet , maybe its the amazing lasagna dish maybe its the pie , soo good , and 1/4 slices . i really like how the restaurant is glowing with a home made feel
2 yeah not so bad chinese food , big portions , family style . the service , does not go out of their way but does their job very well . this would be a classic 3 and a half stars . i like plates that come out sizzling from the
3 fresh sea food is what makes a sea food restaurant in the desert . salt cellar has created a science that allows them to have such a unique menu . if your looking for large <unk> by the lb then you have to check this place out . i <unk>
3 another review for the parlor , quality ingredients with a great atmosphere creates a top restaurant in the biltmore area . a great place to meet up with a group of friends for pizza and wine ! the appetizers were great and the pizza was outstanding . i always enjoy
3 this was my introduction into indian food . the first few times i came here i was like `` ah not bad '' . then i started to try other places , even out of state and in other towns . when i came back to <unk> i really liked
3 went there on a sunday and ended up being the only people in the place . so the service was fine and the two items we ordered were very good . a salmon sandwich and a turkey burger with veggie slaw . i 'd go back .
3 yikes ! i feel sorry if you go to this place and they make you sit on one of their dumb <unk> . otherwise this place is great ! great food , shared a bowl of balls and the empanadas . mmm and a nice bottle of wine . again
4 this place was once known as j chew and company . i loved that place and this new version is still great . so comfy , so casual , so welcoming and so <unk> it 's just the best .
3 nice local non-chain restaurant . neither <unk> or pretentious , more casual and laid back . staff was friendly and attentive , i think our server was even `` the famous justin '' . he helped us pick out the wine and told me about one of the entree that
2 -- good -- friendly service and i enjoyed the food . i 'd like to go back and try a few other items , but right now i 'm kinda perturbed about this place . -- bad -- 1 -rrb- this is just dumb , how could you ever think
3 yay for me , they open at 10:30 am . service quick and helpful . owner -lrb- i think -rrb- was present and seemed to know quite a few of the regulars . i had the panko chicken with an egg roll . both were simple , yet above average
4 i get most of my food stuffs here . great meat , poultry and fish selection . usually and very good prices . i always keep several of the chicken sausages in the freezer for a quick week night meal to throw on the grill . bulk items really come
3 mojitos are huge and oh so good , pricey so try to come during happy hour if you 're on a budget . they have several really unique martinis , like blood orange and a lychee and watermelon -lrb- i think -rrb- for $ 9.50 . i only came here
3 been here a few times now so it 's time for the review . walked up to the hostess on a saturday night and she asked if we had reservations , i said `` no '' because i did n't think this place was like that but then spending some
4 wow , so nice and shiny inside . went to see the swell season here and they sang a couple of songs off mike and their voices carried very well through the entire theater . <unk> speaking , quite an accomplishment . no security <unk> , just little old lady
3 def . a fan and will def . come back . went here about a week ago , had their seasonal strawberry beer ... yum !!!! i want to come back to get a growler ! food was great , had bruschetta , wings and pizza . ca n't go
2 went there tonight with the hubby , after reading the reviews here . the parking lot is very dark and the place is not in a very good area -lrb- there 's 2 strip clubs across the street - towards the front and to the side -rrb- . the fish
2 went here for a friend 's b-day . the food was ok , service was mediocre , had to ask the waiter for water about 4 times , before actually getting it . they serve a variety of seafood , which really isnt that memorable , when i say memorable
3 first impression , this place rocks !! it 's in the space that used to house palette . . the space has a very `` breezy '' sort of caribbean plantation feel that 's easy to relax right into . . not to mention the moment you walk through the
3 as helen y. put it ` <unk> spicy ' ! the flavors were pretty happening and quite exotic . most of the dishes that we tried were off of the special chinese menu in the leather bound menu . i could n't tell you exactly what we were eating as

2 met a friend here last night for dinner -lrb- he 's very very picky so we needed true diversity -rrb- . both the mr and myself were so surprised , after such an abysmal experience . service was nearly spot on , delivered entrees while we were still eating salads
3 `` home of the greatest carne asada in the valley '' is a pretty bold statement for a restaurant to make in a city where there is a taco shop on just about every street corner . for me , good carne asada is all about the quality of the
3 the mister and i eat out way to much and have been frequenting the same places recently . . china chile and joe 's real bbq have both been visited 3x each over the past 3 weeks . . okay so we 're not as imaginative as we could be
3 recently i received word that my favorite middle eastern restaurant <unk> 's kitchen closed its doors . this was , at least for me , the best place to get your mediterranean fix including some of the tastiest stuffed grape leaves around . i can go on and on about
2 we all have our bad days . whether we wake up on the wrong side of the bed or some event turns our mood , we have them . now how you choose to <unk> to them that is what makes the difference . you can have a bad day
2 i love the run down family ran hole in the walls ; they usually make some of the best food around , while diamond 's is n't the best around , its certainly solid authentic style chinese cooking . look around , you 'll probably be the only <unk> diner
4 i love this place . . the pizza here tastes like it did when i was a kid . . back when pizza had a certain mystery and allure . . the smell of cooked pepperoni and not being able to see over the counter to tell what the smell
3 pretty good market considering that most buy from the national grocery chains -lrb- phoenix is a <unk> city !! -rrb- . maya farms is one of my favs . . not only do they carry more exotic vegetables -lrb- <unk> -rrb- but they also added save our farm raw milk
1 no comfy big ass rocking seats . . no souvenir cup for 1.00 refills . . no super cute boys making gourmet popcorn . . not locally owned . . it 's not harkins .
2 as if trapped in a bad cowboy movie , i bellied up to the bar at the original hamburger works and could n't help but think , what have i gotten myself into ? country music was playing on the jukebox , and it was a little <unk> to <unk>
3 i 'm sitting here just perplexed ! i cant believe i have n't yelped about chino until now ! ive been coming here for years and years since its so close to my work . . what have i been smoking ?! i do n't have much to add but
3 stylish and hip yet <unk> manages to stay comfortable and understated ; st. francis is almost one of the best restaurants i 've visited in a long time . there are enough interior design details to satisfy our inner <unk> and a menu that 's well presented and executed ,
3 okay , so i really should have the first to review on this one since the others were n't even reviews . . this place only opened this week . well anyway , let me tell you what . . i just got back from sprinkles , after waiting for

2 while the food in the bar was very tasty the service was just all over the place . this actually started to get stressful as we were supposed to see kathy griffin at the dodge . . we did manage to get the check in time and made the show
1 the salsa is so hot that you 'll be hating life the next day with a burning chocolate <unk> . waiters are jerky and the food is way to salty . . i think they want you to buy more of their over priced drinks ! they lost the mr.
2 ill be the first to admit that orange table in old town scottsdale is probably one of my favorite places for breakfast food . if this place is such a standout , how come ive have n't reviewed them until now ? well it comes down to a singular word
4 for me , it doesnt get much better then this . well organized and a staff that actually knows about wine . very well priced as well . my bff and i were in there last night to start shopping for wine for her <unk> wedding -lrb- sounds doom like
3 love the pizza here . it reminds me of being that fat little kid who loves pepperoni pizza , you know the one . . he 's got pizza sauce all over his face and doesnt care what anyone else thinks ! now that i 'm a fat little man
2 are n't there enough offerings of spicy green and yellow curries to go around the phoenix metro ? the owners of the new lao thai in scottsdale do n't seem to think so . located in an older nondescript shopping center along scottsdale road , the well-kept space wo n't

3 oh gelato spot ... whenever i need something sweet and cold , you deliver ! we came here after dinner the other night for a sweet treat . i always get the coffee and my husband gets the pistachio - this was no different . the employees were nice ,
3 we 've driven by here a few times and eaten at other restaurants in the area but never actually stopped in . the outside is pure white stucco and misleading . i say this because while it looks old and outdated on the outside , the food inside is amazing
2 this pei wei recently transformed into a pei wei market . this was our first time trying out the market and the food still tastes the same but the menu items are more limited . no beef and broccoli - say what ?! luckily they had sweet and sour shrimp
3 i first came here to celebrate a baby shower and was really impressed so i brought the husband and eventually the in-laws . we even attended a retirement party on the patio , which is open and inviting . local breeze was such a great venue to relax at and

3 went there for arizona restaurant week and discovered a gem ! food was excellent , service great and ambiance charming . the only negative is that it is located in an area that seems a little run down .
3 it is pretty loud in here , but other than that i like the food . the chicken sandwich and the fries are great .
1 i used to come to benihana for the fresh food and the experience . the last 2 times i 've been to benihana have been a bad experience , terrible service from our server and the chef both times . the food is expensive and over priced .
3 good food , good sized portions of food . the service is hit or miss at times but the food always comes out great
4 from my days as an asu student to my visits back to tempe as an old man , otto has stood the test of time with solid meals at a great price . there are few things more satisfying than a good slice and an ice-cold coke .
3 the food at persian room is top-notch , and the naan is to die for , but the service is a bit odd . it may have just been our server , who <unk> over the table and touched me a bit too much . my family of eight individually
2 pro : having a sushi bar across the street is great , and the drinks here are relatively cheap -lrb- especially during reverse happy hour -rrb- con : <unk> me at the door while i 'm on a date and making us wear wristbands is about as tacky as it
4 as a former new yorker , i judge a pizzeria on its cheese slice , and pino 's is out of this world . throw in the personalities of the owners , and this restaurant is a little taste of brooklyn in an otherwise drab market .
4 the girl that helped us was super sweet and nice ! it was our first time and she was excited to sample us her favorite as well as the most popular till we found one we loved ! then we found two ! ice cream is so yummy and creamy
0 horrible , horrible , horrible , service . our waitress did n't do anything . another waitress took down and brought our drinks , took our order and a different waiter brought us our food . if it had been busy , i would n't be so harsh . it
4 i went in not even knowing what drink i had from yardhouse and even with my vague description this staff member , scott , was so smart and patient with me that he figured it out ! he actually even improved the drink with another recommendation ! they all have
1 unfortunately i will no longer be recommending loving hut . is it because the food tastes like crap ? no . is it due to weird hours of business or bad service ? no . it 's because it 's just too expensive now . bordering on a complete rip-off
3 went in today and got the golden vermicelli . same great taste , same store and same service , but that dish cost me $ <unk> . my older copy of the take-out menu here at work shows it as $ <unk> which imo was already on the upper end
4 okay , so this review has been a long time coming . not sure why i have n't written one in the more than five years since i 've been coming to greek wraps , but better late then never . i love this place . i 've had greek

3 this is a delicious neighborhood restaurant ! i ca n't speak to their sushi much because i have become such a fan of other items on the menu . the handful plus times i have had sashimi here it has always been good . now on to my favorites !
3 3 words ... twice baked potato ! oh my , these are so good !!! i love these so much i have even ordered them to go when we are grilling steaks at home . but it is always nice we we go there for dinner too . the rest
2 this place is a hoot ! a friend wanted to go to a movie that had been out for a while and it turned out that it was only still playing at this theater and one other . this is typically a $ 3 theater , we happened to go
3 this is another one of those cases where the quality of the food does n't quite meet the quality of the service . we loved the food ! my lamb shank was tender and the barley gravy perfectly done . our waiter just seemed to be a tad off .
4 at the end of a long day , this was the perfect resting spot ! we grabbed a table outside so we could watch the central ave <unk> while sipping our tasty happy hour drinks . our waitress , tia , was the best . being on a restricted diet
3 the best fried chicken and waffles ever ! i think subconsciously you feel less guilty if you order the fried chicken breast but it was awesome . we all split sides of mac n cheese and collard greens . friendly , attentive staff . ca n't wait to go again
3 very fun , lively , authentic german restaurant . our waiter , <unk> , really made us feel like he just got in from germany . he was probably from iowa or something silly but he did a great job of making us comfortable and being in the moment .
3 nourish is a <unk> , gluten-free , paleo , dairy free eaters dream come true . having a friend who is all of these , its hard to find a really fun , <unk> , place to take him . this place has everything a normal trendy scottsdale restaurant would
2 on saturday night we were looking for late night bite - there was an hour wait for a table at 10pm but the atmosphere is great and we were into the music . hanny 's is definitely `` the scene '' kind of place , and its fun if you

4 so , got a tip from a friend that i really needed to check this place out , so we headed over for dinner with friends after ignite phoenix . i kind of wanted to go some place else and wound up being s glad my friend picked this place
2 good , but nothing really outstanding . service is friendly and attentive here . the salsa has quite a kick . i ordered the seafood enchiladas . good flavor , wish they had a bit more of a cream sauce or something . unfortunately , they did a number on
2 good food , pass on the staff attitude . we ordered the chicago stuffed pizza on sunday evening . the waiter pushed us to order an appetizer or salad and this was after we asked for suggestions on the 10 or 12 inches . after suggesting what size he thought
0 do n't do it ! my friend and i went there this evening for dinner as it had been a while . our drinks arrived fairly quickly as did our appetizer . the drinks were ok , quality of liquor used was lower end . our entrees which were both

3 perfect greek quick food place . staff is very friendly and portions are quite large for the money . my only <unk> is that the gyro meat needs a bit more flavor , but then again , maybe i just need to add tzatziki sauce . they also offer various
1 terrible service for large groups . a reservation was set up for a large group of about 10 people . the table was reserved and set aside ok . the staff appeared helpful , courteous and friendly . the <unk> was cosmopolitan and very urban . i ordered the chilean

3 my last review of this place was <unk> and i still love the hell outta this place . the food is very good , varied , and inexpensive . they have a really great happy hour , too . my faves are their spicy korean beef , crispy calamari ,
3 i got ta say this was a very pleasant surprise . i am generally turned off by places that seem to cater to an upscale crowd and was very hesitant to try this place . as we pulled into the parking that was almost soley devoted to valet , my
4 <unk> ... my stomach hurts from gorging on their delicious cinnamon roll . my husband was kind enough to snag a few bites <unk> i go overboard and eat the whole thing which left me to eat 80 % of it . it is $ <unk> and a pretty good

4 i simply can not get over how much i have fallen in love with this place . i have lived in cenpho for several years now and have only just tried cheuvront in the last four months or so . i mistakenly assumed it was a pretentious wine restaurant but
1 this review is a four for the classic mojitos and a one for the service . it is a damn shame because those are the best mojitos i have had in phoenix but the service is so damn shitty . do n't get me wrong , the bartenders are nice
